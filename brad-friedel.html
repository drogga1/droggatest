  <p><b>[Former USA goalkeeper Brad Friedel, after being named the Pac-12’s football Player of the Century]</b> This is a fantastic honor and I am both surprised and humbled to receive this recognition … When you consider that for many years there was no professional US league, most leading US players started their careers at college level. There were some great players who have represented the Pac-12, so I am especially proud</p>

  <p><b>[Former USA goalkeeper Brad Friedel on the challenges he faced when he first moved from America to England in an interview with Sports Illustrated Kids]</b> The food, for one! The weather, for two! I lived up in the north of England, the northwest in Manchester for a long time. And you don’t see the sun up there. You go through a lot of things. The biggest difference was that I moved to a country where soccer was the number one thing and the be all and end all to a lot of people’s lives. It is an interesting transition time to take all that in, don’t get a big head, don’t get too down when someone says you’re bad. Keep a level head. It takes some time to adapt to that. That’s the biggest change</p>

  <p><b>[Brad Friedel says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> helped me become a coach]</b> He’s one of the very best out there and I have no problem saying that. His attention to detail and what I was able to see and learn from him, was priceless. The best way to describe it is, yes, he knows the tactics that he wants to play, and yes he knows how to implement them in training, but it’s all the extracurriculars around being a head coach that he manages himself, his staff, and all around him so well.<br /><br />I’m not surprised he’s doing so well, and the players have a bigger value than when he came into the changing room. I expect him to be a very good coach for a very long time<br /><br />When you go into head coaching you have to be your own guy. You have to learn how to deal with things - like those above you, those around you - and Graeme would deal with those issues head on. He had zero fear. I’m not saying my personality is the exact same, but when I look back on his career, you got to see how he navigated it. I’m going to do things like myself, but it’s interesting to see how all the head coaches dealt with things.<br /><br /><a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> was the same. They were two totally different types of coach though. Graeme used very few analytics, Mark came in and used analytics a lot. People can debate what is right and wrong, but it’s two very different styles<br /><br />While I was at the club <b>[<a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>]</b>, it was a wonderfully run football club with the Walker Trust running it. I thought they did an impeccable job with running the club, and putting a really good product on the field. When I left, I can’t really comment on what’s happened, but I’m very sad to see what has happened. <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, a lot of the same. I thought Randy Lerner and Paul Faulkner were excellent people to deal with. While I was at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> it was a very well run football club, and I’m very sad to see where they are now because they’re an enormous club and they shouldn’t be in the Championship<br /><br />I think there’s a large amount of trust between <b>[the general manager]</b> Mike Burns and myself. I don’t see there being any reason why there won’t be a great amount of trust between <b>[the owners]</b> Robert and Jonathan Kraft and myself. That is a huge part of the reason why I came here.<br /><br />In saying that, I’m under no illusion that if my staff and myself don’t do our job the owners will act accordingly. The fact Mike and I were friends was irrelevant in the hiring, but his honesty and integrity was a huge factor, and I’m sure he’d say the same about myself<br /><br />I’m not the type of guy that’s going to talk about x’s and o’s right now. It’ll be there for people to see. The team will be 100% committed to how we want to play, and our staff will be 100% committed to that, and I will be 100% committed to the club</p>

  <p><b>[The Portland Timbers will need to slow down Atlanta United’s Miguel Almiron in Saturday’s MLS Cup final]</b> I think Almiron is the key player for Atlanta. I know Martinez scores the goals, but I think if you can limit Almiron’s touches on the ball, that will help tremendously.<br /><br />Defensively <b>[the Timbers]</b> have Chara, who is excellent in the holding midfield role. Even if you need to go box to box, he can do that as well. But he’ll be pivotal in this game, trying to block off the passing lanes to Almiron<br /><br />When you lose the ball, you have to win it back. You have to limit opportunities when Almiron gets the ball. You have to play physically against them when you don’t have the ball. And with the ball, you have to finish your plays and your actions. You can’t lose the ball in that middle third of the field. If you do, they will spring attacks and spring them quickly<br /><br />Portland need to score the first goal because Atlanta are an exceptionally gifted team when they go up one goal. They can sit back and counter and they’re difficult to stop on the counter<br /><br />They have a couple of match winners in their team as well. <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri. <b>[Sebastian]</b> Blanco’s very good. Jeremy Ebobisse’s done very well the last half of the season for them. You have a holding midfielder who is one of the best in MLS in Chara and they have some good components themselves. This is, by no means, going to be an easy task for either of the teams and as a neutral, I’m just hoping for an entertaining match</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle’s new signing Miguel Almiron has all the tools needed to become a top Premier League player]</b> Almiron may be a loss to Atlanta, but is a definite gain for Newcastle. He was exceptional and the Atlanta scouting network did a fantastic job in bringing him and I know they paid a lot of money by MLS standards, and he did a fantastic job there. The Premier League is different; it’s very fast and physical but he has the tools to deal with it, to be very good in England. Any league in the world, it will take any player a little bit of adapting, but he has the potential to do very well over there. I think any team that signed him would have had someone to link up with him very well, and you’ll see his pace.<br /><br />Historically, MLS has not been a selling league, so it’s good to see that clubs are taking note of the MLS and paying those sorts of transfer fees. He has the pace and technical ability to succeed in English football, and I wish him the very best of luck!<br /><br />I actually signed for Newcastle in 1994, but I wasn’t able to attain a work permit so I went from Newcastle to Brondby. I was playing for the USA, but they didn’t have an appeals process on the work permit, and you had to have played 75% of your national team’s games over the last two years, and when I had applied I think I was 22 years of age and I was the number two at the World Cup and only had 50/60%, but by the time I signed with Liverpool that’s when I had 75%.</p>

  <p><b>[New England Revolution head coach Brad Friedel is targeting the Premier League in a quest to make new signings]</b> There are definitely Premier League players that I am interested in, but I can’t give away any secrets. There are quite a few that I have touched base with and it has to work for our squad. It helps when we are going for targeted money allocation players when spending more money. But I’m definitely using my relationships, but they have to be able to do the business on the field. I don’t know every player but there will be someone that I know that can get to a player, and these things usually take months and months of scouting the player both on and off the field, but it’s something that I’m trying to use and forge relationships to get the right players<br /><br />We have a very good scouting network that we set up last season, including the club’s first-ever chief scout and we’ve just hired another one for South America and what we look for consistently are people who are going to better the squad. Whether we bring in players from England, other parts of Europe, South America, or other parts of the world is sort of irrelevant to us, we’re trying to bring in people in the positions where we feel that we need help<br /><br />I saw Harry Kane post a couple of photos with a few of the Patriots players, so we will have to see what happens there in the future!</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane may have had a few failed loan spells before becoming Tottenham’s talisman]</b> We absolutely knew how good Kane was going to be, and it was noted many times in our staff meeting and our meetings when I was starting my coaching at Tottenham. As a player, each and every one of us knew that he was a truly special talent. He has proved that hard work does pay off, and he still works harder than everyone else out there, that’s why he is so good. On top of that, he obviously has the talent. He scored past me in training once or twice maybe, but they didn’t count as I was over 40!<br /><br />He has always been enamoured by US sports, from the time that I have known him, always very interested in US sports. He’s been injured so was able to take in the Super Bowl and when we went on pre-season tour, he threw the first pitch out at the Chicago Cubs games so he does like the American sports. He knew more about US sports than I did, I was out of the US for so long and I became engulfed in football over here and really fell out of tune with American sports. Obviously, since I’ve moved back I’ve been back in tune with it, and working with New England Patriots, obviously I know how good they are, but he definitely knows more about any American sports than I do.<br /><br />There are 13 games to play, who knows who is going to win the Premier League? Tottenham, Liverpool, Man City are all such top teams. It’s going to be close to the finish, but I hope it’s between Liverpool and Tottenham, being two of my former clubs. I’d let them battle it out and I would be happy to see either of them win it.<br /><br />I was very grateful to John McDermott at Tottenham’s academy for the help he gave me when starting out my coaching career there. In my last year, I was grateful for the help that Mauricio Pochettino and his team gave me. It was tremendous and just a really valuable experience. I still have a lot of friends and relationships there, and seeing them right up there whilst battling with the budgets they are on, it’s tremendous to see. Mauricio and his staff are truly one of the great teams</p>

  <p><b>[Former goalkeeper Friedel says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are ahead of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> overall]</b> These games, especially early in the season, you never know how they’ll pan out. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have a good group of players who have been with Mauricio (Pochettino) for a long time, and they were unlucky in the game v <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, on the other hand, won their first two and came up against a very talented <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side. I don’t know if you can put a favourite on this match, I think overall <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are a little ahead of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have outstanding players and a very good head coach. It’s a tough one to call but I’m obviously going for Tottenham<br /><br /><b>[He feels the new signings of <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a>, Giovanni <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Lo Celso</a> and <a href="ryan-sessegnon.html">Ryan Sessegnon</a> will pan out but he still curious about Danish International <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>’s future]</b> It’ll be interesting to see what happens with <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>. He’s a very good player. As far as who they bought, I would back pretty much anyone that Mauricio (Pochettino) buys because they do a lot of homework on everyone, but not everyone will be a hit every time. He doesn’t get them wrong too often. They would’ve looked at the character traits and ability of the players so I would back his signings. I don’t think lots has to be done with the squad, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is one of the best strikers in the world, you have a lot power and pace on the wings and in the centre midfield. You have an excellent goalkeeper and strong back line - I think they’re set up to do very, very well again</p>

  <p><b>[Brad Friedel says that <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Gio Reyna</a>’s rise with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> has been even faster than expected]</b> The emergence has happened so quick for Gio. He was over in the U.S. for NYCFC doing well. I’m sure everyone is familiar with his dad who had a very successful playing career over in England, Germany, and Scotland.<br /><br />I’ve seen Gio play many times in academy sides for New York as well as the youth national sides. Everyone expected him to leave and play in Europe somewhere, but we didn’t expect to see him emerge in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s first team so quickly - it’s great for him, and amazing for football over here in the U.S. as well</p>

  <p><b>[Brad Friedel says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> must be given time to build a squad in his own image at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will come good at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. People are quick to point the finger nowadays and people don’t get lots of time or chances in management. I know that, especially from personal experience! Until last week, there were zero of his own signings. There are players that he likes don’t get me wrong - but not his players. So he’ll need a couple of transfer windows to form his own team.<br /><br />This January window has not been an easy period to get players in, teams will always pay well over the odds for players that aren’t necessarily their first choices. Jose’s current period was more of an assessment of the squad and the players he has available, and those that are leaving.<br /><br />Hopefully the new signings can help get a couple of results and get them into the Champions League places. The time to see if his appointment was indeed a success would be after three or four transfer windows if he’s given that time, but head coaches often aren’t given that time in the current climate. I hope it goes well, they are a tremendous club with an incredible stadium, and a fantastic training ground and wonderful people associated with the club. They can turn it around</p>
