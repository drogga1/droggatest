  <p><b>[<a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> captain Alexander Tettey fumes over James penalty call in <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> defeat]</b> It was a bit strange. The referee tells me there was no penalty. I told him there was no punishment. James told <b>[<a href="tim-krul.html">Tim Krul</a>]</b> that there was no penalty. However, then we get someone who sits somewhere and says they are penalties. I don’t think so. I was really pissed off throughout the game. First and foremost, we do some things that are really weird and then you have this VAR stuff that makes you have to wait. You play the game, you have adrenaline from before, you don’t need more things to create excitement. What is it about? Just decide it so the game can move on. How can they determine that they are penalties? If the referee sees it clearly, can’t he decide? Who knows?<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder was also thoroughly unimpressed with the way his side defended against United]</b> I was shocked. I don’t know how we can be so naive and give away so much space. That should not happen. We have a right-back who is in no man’s land, we have a centre-back that is higher than the other, and he does not know where the attacker is. <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s goal]</b> shouldn’t have happened. If you let such goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> time and again, you have no chance. It’s okay to let in goals, but not in that way. I’m still very upset about it. I should not be too strict, but I think we make ‘junior football mistakes’</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Tettey should be, in his words, immune to this by now. If <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> are to fall, it will be a record fifth <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> relegation for <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">the Canaries</a>, of which skipper Tettey would have been part of three]</b> It’s very difficult. I thought I was immune, because I’ve experienced exactly what we’re going through before. I thought I’d think: ‘Yeah, I’ve been there, done that, I know how it feels, I know how to cope with it … ‘ but now it’s the same<br /><br />It gets to you because you care. You care about the club, the team-mates, and it gets to you. You can say: ‘It’s just football’ but it’s a struggle. I so want this club and my team-mates to be successful, that it’s tough to take. To be around relegation battle it does something to you mate, it’s not nice. It makes you stronger as a football player, being around this situation, how you cope with your emotions, but it’s not easy<br /><br />For example, and I’ve had this a lot since I’ve been at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, as a footballer player, playing massive games, which these games at the moment are in the relegation battle, it impacts you<br /><br />You get home and you are super moody, even to your kids and wife! You are like: ‘Please don’t talk to me.’ That’s how much it impacts us as players. How can you not talk to your kids and wife?! It’s just a football game. But it’s just a huge mental thing because you want to do better<br /><br />The game was on Saturday. Still on Sunday and Monday I was thinking about it. Still I am thinking: ‘I should have done better … why didn’t I play my best game? Why didn’t I do this differently?’ and this goes on sometimes even until the day of the next game, where you totally leave it behind. It’s a huge psychological part of this situation. It really gets you to be honest<br /><br />But that’s where you need to be mentally strong and cope with it. That’s how a lot of teams get out of these situations, because they know how to mentally cope with it. After a loss, they put it away and go again. That’s what the message has been, to try your hardest to put it away, because you need a frame of mind where you can push and go again and again and again. That’s what we are trying to do here</p>

In terms of players, he doesn’t have the 10, 15, 20 million-pound players, he has young talent mixed with a couple of senior players and not all of them has had <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience. He’s done everything he could to be fair and it’s tough for him as well at times when he wants to play differently but hasn’t had the players to do that.</p>
