  <p><b>[Adrian Mariappa say’s it’s an ‘honour’ to play for ‘incredible’ Watford fans after FA Cup final defeat]</b> The fans were incredible, even at 6-0 down. That’s what this club is all about. It is an honour to put the shirt on and play in front of those fans every week.<br /><br />No-one likes losing 6-0, even against a top side. We started well and had a good shape but in this type of game if you don’t take your chances you know they can hurt you. We needed to take ours. We wanted to be solid and catch them on the break, but they were very clinical on the day<br /><br /><b>[He believes there is a lot of pride to be taken from their showing this year]</b> It’s very tough to get to a final so it’s a massive achievement for our club. It is a step forward and there are lots of positives to take. We are disappointed but it is a great achievement to get here. We have to take massive pride for this season. I have to give great credit to all the boys</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> defender Adrian Mariappa reveals he’s tested positive for Covid-19]</b> It’s quite scary how you can feel absolutely fine and not really have left the house, and yet still get the virus. If it wasn’t for the fact I had gone back to training and had this test, then I’d never have found out that I had the virus and I would just be getting on with things as normal. That’s obviously quite a strange thought<br /><br />I live with three of my children, who are five, nine and 11, and my partner and, obviously, now I’m a bit worried about them. They are all fine and are not showing any symptoms, but you can’t help but think about it and keep your distance once you know you’ve tested positive</p>
