  <p><b>[Watford defender Adrian Mariappa reveals he’s tested positive for Covid-19]</b> It’s quite scary how you can feel absolutely fine and not really have left the house, and yet still get the virus. If it wasn’t for the fact I had gone back to training and had this test, then I’d never have found out that I had the virus and I would just be getting on with things as normal. That’s obviously quite a strange thought<br /><br />I live with three of my children, who are five, nine and 11, and my partner and, obviously, now I’m a bit worried about them. They are all fine and are not showing any symptoms, but you can’t help but think about it and keep your distance once you know you’ve tested positive</p>
