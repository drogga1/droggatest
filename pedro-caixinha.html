  <p><b>[Rangers have confirmed they have appointed Pedro Caixinha as manager]</b> It is a great honour to join Rangers Football Club. This club has a great history and tradition and I am proud to follow in the footsteps of legendary Rangers managers like Walter Smith, Graeme Souness and Jock Wallace. Rangers is a name that is known worldwide and I am looking forward to forging a positive relationship with supporters and meeting the playing squad and staff at the Club. I know there is a lot of hard work ahead and I assure all our fans that I will do all I can to provide a winning and entertaining Rangers team.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers vs Progres Niederkorn]</b> This match is what we have been working hard to prepare in order to deliver tomorrow a fantastic game and a fantastic qualifier. Two days ago the stadium sold out, so all the club is very enthusiastic about it’s return to Europe after six years, and we hope to delight and give to the fans a fantastic match, a fantastic tie and a fantastic qualification after these six years. There has been too much time waiting for this moment and we want to deliver a good team to our fans. We have some changes, but some players didn’t start with us on June 5 so they will not be with us tomorrow. I can tell you we will maybe have four new players in the first XI and two or three more on the bench.<br /><br />All of the players we have brought in this short time were our first choices, and we know the other players we are going to bring will be first choices also. We still have two months in front of us knowing exactly what we are going to get and we are going to get it</p>

  <p><b>[Ross County vs Rangers]</b> What I need to tell you, and it’s a Portuguese saying but it’s an interesting one, is that ‘the dogs bark and the caravan passes’ - the caravan keeps moving, the caravan keeps going. That means we are focused on our work, we are focusing on our job and we are all together in the same direction. We are the ones that know which direction we are going and our fans, as I told you, the anonymous ones, they are supporting us for the good.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha has likened his addiction to winning to that of a vampire’s thirst for blood]</b> It means it is only the first one. The vampires taste the flavour of the blood and they want more, they need it. It’s the same with the competitive teams and clubs, competitive players and competitive managers. They like the way the blood tastes. I did it at Santos Laguna in Mexico and it’s like a sort of addiction, you know?<br /><br />People are addicted to smoking or eating food or playing sport. I am an addict to the win - that’s why I work so hard because my focus is to win. And if the addict doesn’t get his fix? Keep working. I was addicted to winning when I started coaching and started with the Under-14s, it was on the inside of me. After that, I went to the Under-17s and it was the same. Then I went to the Under-19s, then an amateur team then Sporting of Lisbon. I went all the way as an assistant wanting to win. Next I went to a lower team in the Portuguese league and my desire was winning. That’s my essence.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers have confirmed that manager Pedro Caixinha has parted company with the club]</b> Rangers Football Club announce today <b>[Thursday, October 26, 2017]</b> that Pedro Caixinha has left the Club. The decision to part company with Pedro was taken after careful consideration and the search for a new manager will begin immediately.<br /><br />Pedro was appointed in March this year but results have been disappointing and not commensurate with the level of investment that was made available. Graeme Murty, head development squad coach, will take charge of the first-team in the interim, just as he did earlier this year.<br /><br />The priority is to appoint a new manager as quickly as possible, but the Board will take as much time as is necessary to secure the right person capable of representing Rangers and providing the brand of football supporters rightly expect. We, the Board, appreciate this is a difficult time for all Rangers supporters and we thank you for your patience and know Graeme and the players will receive your full backing in the days ahead.<br /><br />We thank Pedro and his backroom staff for their efforts and commitment and wish them well for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Cruz Azul win over Chivas shows Pedro Caixinha has building blocks for success]</b> The thinking that we did was that we’re Cruz Azul, one of the grandes of Mexico, and we should have this in our mind. Beyond the result, the thinking in halftime is what we should always take going forward. I’ve been at the club for a month. It’s a grande in Mexico. We should think in big things to do big things. People should see the pride we have, the determination. You can’t have the luxury of being afraid. This is my job from here on. We haven’t won anything. Beyond soccer, we have to have determination to play like a big team</p>

  <p><b>[Can Rangers flop Gullit Pena seize his chance against Club America?]</b> Before the match against Monterrey in San Antonio, yes, something happened which I’m not going to talk about, but yesterday or two days ago he said something about a knock so you have to take care of him. That’s why ‘Gullit’ will have his opportunity.<br /><br />I told <b>[forward Martin Cauteruccio]</b>: You’re going to score the goal that gives us the win. I told him, later I told the group, and now I’m telling you <b>[in the press]</b>. Caute is going to score and he’s going to be a factor in the game. I have all the confidence in Gullit, just like I have it in Cauteruccio</p>

But that’s not to say I can do everything. When you go against what the fundamental rules and principles are of an institution and when you also go against the fundamental principles and values of the coach, well, decisions must be made and when I have the control of those decisions, I make them very clear. He’s not going to continue with us, and he has to get in contact with Rangers because he was here on a loan process for a year. The situation now will continue, but not on our level. He has to make this contact.</p>

  <p><b>[Grande? Not a grande? It’s time to put a tired Liga MX debate to bed]</b> Tigres has a really rich squad. I’d say that Tuca has to be the reference for Mexican football managers since I’ve known it. From there to being considered a grande, from my perspective there are three points: the history a club has in a country where there are clubs with more than 100 years of existence, the trophies, we understand clearly it’s the best team in terms of football titles in the last decade, the example team in Mexico and the fans have to be national and international, not just local. A grande has to have these three things.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers flop Pedro Caixinha getting redemption at Cruz Azul]</b> With what the fans are hoping for, the man on the street, my answer is the same. We have to beat everyone. That’s our mentality. But what’s it worth to me to beat America if after that you don’t win anything else? If you don’t win, it’s OK. You have to know how to live life in moderation, with this balance. I’m now more experienced having lived through these things and finding that balance.<br /><br />At this club, you can only go out to win all competitions. It’s going to take time for the club, but the focus is to be the most successful in Mexico and that’s way we have to win trophies</p>
