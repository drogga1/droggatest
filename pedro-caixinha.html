  <p><b>[Rangers have confirmed they have appointed Pedro Caixinha as manager]</b> It is a great honour to join Rangers Football Club. This club has a great history and tradition and I am proud to follow in the footsteps of legendary Rangers managers like Walter Smith, Graeme Souness and Jock Wallace. Rangers is a name that is known worldwide and I am looking forward to forging a positive relationship with supporters and meeting the playing squad and staff at the Club. I know there is a lot of hard work ahead and I assure all our fans that I will do all I can to provide a winning and entertaining Rangers team.</p>

  <p><b>[Cruz Azul win over Chivas shows Pedro Caixinha has building blocks for success]</b> The thinking that we did was that we’re Cruz Azul, one of the grandes of Mexico, and we should have this in our mind. Beyond the result, the thinking in halftime is what we should always take going forward. I’ve been at the club for a month. It’s a grande in Mexico. We should think in big things to do big things. People should see the pride we have, the determination. You can’t have the luxury of being afraid. This is my job from here on. We haven’t won anything. Beyond soccer, we have to have determination to play like a big team</p>

  <p><b>[Can Rangers flop Gullit Pena seize his chance against Club America?]</b> Before the match against Monterrey in San Antonio, yes, something happened which I’m not going to talk about, but yesterday or two days ago he said something about a knock so you have to take care of him. That’s why ‘Gullit’ will have his opportunity.<br /><br />I told <b>[forward Martin Cauteruccio]</b>: You’re going to score the goal that gives us the win. I told him, later I told the group, and now I’m telling you <b>[in the press]</b>. Caute is going to score and he’s going to be a factor in the game. I have all the confidence in Gullit, just like I have it in Cauteruccio</p>

  <p><b>[Cruz Azul coach Pedro Caixinha confirmed Wednesday that Carlos Pena will not continue on loan with the club]</b> I don’t think anyone in Mexican soccer has given as many chances to Gullit as I have, in such a short period of time. But that’s not to say I can do everything. When you go against what the fundamental rules and principles are of an institution and when you also go against the fundamental principles and values of the coach, well, decisions must be made and when I have the control of those decisions, I make them very clear. He’s not going to continue with us, and he has to get in contact with Rangers because he was here on a loan process for a year. The situation now will continue, but not on our level. He has to make this contact.</p>

  <p><b>[Grande? Not a grande? It’s time to put a tired Liga MX debate to bed]</b> Tigres has a really rich squad. I’d say that Tuca has to be the reference for Mexican football managers since I’ve known it. From there to being considered a grande, from my perspective there are three points: the history a club has in a country where there are clubs with more than 100 years of existence, the trophies, we understand clearly it’s the best team in terms of football titles in the last decade, the example team in Mexico and the fans have to be national and international, not just local. A grande has to have these three things.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers flop Pedro Caixinha getting redemption at Cruz Azul]</b> With what the fans are hoping for, the man on the street, my answer is the same. We have to beat everyone. That’s our mentality. But what’s it worth to me to beat America if after that you don’t win anything else? If you don’t win, it’s OK. You have to know how to live life in moderation, with this balance. I’m now more experienced having lived through these things and finding that balance.<br /><br />At this club, you can only go out to win all competitions. It’s going to take time for the club, but the focus is to be the most successful in Mexico and that’s way we have to win trophies</p>

We never can let ourselves get distracted. We’re focused on what we have, how the match will go and what we’re going to do in the game. We’re only interested in one thing: Winning.</p>
