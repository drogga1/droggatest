  <p><b>[League Managers Association has confirmed that referees will be invited to participate in training sessions with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and Football League clubs next season]</b> This is a fantastic outcome following consolation with the games stakeholders and proves what positive outcomes can be achieved when the game works closer together. The LMA and its members are committed to assisting PGMOL in the improvement of refereeing standards and also give their full support to PGMOL receiving the necessary funding to accommodate increased opportunities for training and development of all PL and FL officials. We are therefore delighted that our members offer to assist in the improvement of refereeing standards has been accepted by PGMOL and all the games stakeholders</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="david-o-leary.html">David O’Leary</a> wins £3.3m compensation claim from Dubai-based Al Ahli]</b> We are clearly delighted with the outcome. In addition, the LMA is extremely grateful to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for their assistance in initiating the process with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. The added significance and wider impact of this process is the proof that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> has mechanisms in place which regulate worldwide employment issues. It is extremely encouraging to know that the world governing body can provide a means of redress for managers and coaches at all levels seeking to establish their employment rights, wherever in the world they happen to work</p>

  <p><b>[The proposal needs 14 out of the 20 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs to vote in favour and when asked if its defeat would mean the end of the season]</b> Yes, I think that probably is correct. The government, if they haven’t already, will be making it clear that home matches with densely populated stadia, really puts into question whether social distancing rules can be adhered to<br /><br />Football must not occupy any NHS resources, it must not impinge on the capacity of the health and emergency services. <b>[A safe return]</b> covers testing, tracking, PPE available, clear guidelines on social distancing, and obviously a safe environment to train and play. There will be guidance on cardiology, mental and emotional well-being. And I think the message really is that health is a guiding principle to any decision-making</p>
