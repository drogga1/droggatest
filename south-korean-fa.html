  <p>[Maurizio Sarri has confirmed Cristiano Ronaldo sat out Juventus’ exhibition match against Team K League in Seoul on Friday due to fatigue] We gave room to some of the younger figures who were ready to step up. Ronaldo was very tired, so we decided to rest him. Ronaldo was expected to play, but he was not 100 per cent fit due to muscle fatigue. I spoke with Andrea and Ronaldo before the match and we concluded that it would be best for him to rest<br /><br />Now we have 10 days without games, so we can focus on preparing well in training</p>

Cristiano Ronaldo’s failure to get on the field during a recent Juventus friendly has caused football supporters in South Korea to take legal action against the match organisers. The superstar forward stayed on the bench for the whole 90 minutes during Juve’s 3-3 draw with the K-League All Stars team at Seoul World Cup Stadium last week</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Cristiano Ronaldo no-show leaves K League fuming at Juventus ‘shamelessness, untruth and deception’] K League cannot help but feel disappointed and cheated by Juventus for its shamelessness. Juventus said in its reply that Ronaldo’s absence was due to muscle fatigue from previous matches that had forced him to take a rest. If Ronaldo was unable to play, it would be a blatant deception to include Ronaldo as a substitute on the start list. Also, according to a phone recording between the promoter and an official from Juventus released in the media, everyone from Juventus including Ronaldo himself and the manager Sarri knew it clearly that Ronaldo was supposed to play.<br /><br />Yet, Juventus has so far avoided responsibility for Ronaldo’s no-show without any explanations. Other assertions from Juventus are also filled with untruth and deception. K League clearly register our profound indignation and disappointment to Juventus’s irresponsible behaviour and manners, and we strongly urge Juventus to offer a sincere apology and explain the reason for Ronaldo’s no-show.</p>
