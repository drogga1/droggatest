<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chinedu Ede has retired from football to pursue a career in music, and has admitted to still being under the residual effects of drugs while playing]</b> I started because it was fun. In this industry, and football really is an industry, they simply want adaptable robots, who keep telling the same shit over and over again. Everything around it, with all these officials - it disgusted me. 99 per cent of the players who spoke openly and honestly were replaced very quickly. Everything made me feel so disgusted. It had nothing to do with the original sport anymore. Anybody with rough edges was chiselled down until they fit into this world. Sure, you got a lot of money for it, but in the end no money in the world justifies not being able to be yourself.<br /><br /><b>[Asked to explain whether the aforementioned line really was about drugs]</b> It’s basically the way it’s understood. Sometimes you lose touch with reality so much and want to make it right, so it was like medicine. Then you play and you still have a residual effect from the drugs. But on the other hand, I also mean the fact that I was playing on painkillers all the time. When you had an injury, you were encouraged to start <b>[training]</b> again earlier than was really good for your body</p>
