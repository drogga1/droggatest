<blockquote>
  <p>Georges St. Pierre has been called one of the greatest athletes Canada has ever produced. Right up there, mixed martial arts fans argue, with Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr and Steve Nash. But when you drive into Brantford, Ont., Gretzky’s hometown, or Parry Sound, the birthplace of Bobby Orr, there are road signs proudly proclaiming the fact that one of their own made it big on the world stage. Not so in St. Pierre’s hometown of Saint-Isidore.<br /><br />Turning on to route 207 from the main highway towards Saint-Isidore, giant wind turbines turn slowly in the distance on the left. Closer to the town, there is large statue of a Holstein cow on the right and then houses begin to outnumber farms. On opposite corners at the town’s main intersection, just past the post office with the Canadian flag flying out front, there is a church, library, municipal office and sports bar, Le Rendez-Vous de Sportif<br /><br />Yet, in Georges St. Pierre’s hometown, it’s hard to find a sign, a poster, anything, that informs a visitor that the biggest name in the UFC - an outfit that has exploded worldwide in popularity in recent years - is from there, or that his parents, Roland and Pauline, still reside in the small farming community. Even inside Le Rendez-Vous des Sportif, where the locals will gather on Saturday night to watch their hometown hero attempt to regain his title, there is very little evidence that this is GSP’s home, other than a couple of posters on the window and some newspaper articles posted on a bulletin board<br /><br />Bartender Lysa Pacquette said people in the town are proud of their world champion, but shrugs when asked why there aren’t any road signs or any prominent facilities named after St. Pierre. Pacquette says that there is a place, down the street, near the outdoor arena and baseball diamond, that is named in honour of the UFC star. And so there is. It’s a small chalet, like a changing cabin. On the outside wall a plaque reads ‘Chalet des Loisirs, Georges St-Pierre’. And that’s it. No grand statues or monuments, no indoor arena named after the hometown boy, who has become a Quebec and Canadian sports icon. But driving through the small French-speaking town and talking to some of the people, one gets the impression that they don’t kick up a fuss for <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> because he wouldn’t want them to. There’s a modest, almost bashful feel to the town. A giant road sign or splashy arena named in GSP’s honour would probably look out of place here</p>
