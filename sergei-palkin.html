  <p><b>[Shakhtar Donetsk CEO Sergei Palkin has told <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that they must pay Alex Teixeira’s £50 million (€70m) buyout clause if they wish to sign the Brazilian in the January transfer window]</b> They offered €32 million (£24m) with a €4m (£3m) bonus. We obviously refused to accept it. Our position is that we do not want to sell Teixeira today. We will sell only at the end of the season - we need to show serious results in Europa League and Ukrainian Championship. At the end of the season we will sit down at the negotiating table. His buyout clause is €70m. <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> can pay it now if they want. We don’t mind</p>

  <p><b>[Shakhtar Donetsk have confirmed that in-demand midfielder Fred will be heading to Manchester this summer]</b> Fred will leave in June. If not to Manchester City, then to Manchester United. He is ready for the best championships. In addition to being very good, Fred is very professional</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Manchester United made their first move to land Fred back in April]</b> We conducted the negotiations with the representatives of Man United for over two months. Since April, their scout had been constantly present at all our home games in Kharkiv. Jose Mourinho wanted to see Fred at Man United. The negotiations were interesting, and, as I said earlier, we are fully satisfied with the agreement terms. Fred has been at Shakhtar since 2013, he has grown seriously as a football player, deserving to continue his performance in a stronger league. I’m sure he will progress and improve his level. I wish him every success in the Premier League. It’s nice that our former players - Willian, Fernandinho, <b>[Henrikh]</b> Mkhitaryan, and Fred - will be playing in England for the top clubs competing for the top spot.</p>
