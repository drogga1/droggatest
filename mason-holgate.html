  <p><b>[Mason Holgate is glad of the opportunities he has been given this season]</b> I was sat counting down the seconds. We were linked with a lot of players in the summer, a lot of centre-backs, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t look at that and wonder. I was thinking I might need to get out again if I want to play. I knew I was turning 23 this season, and I couldn’t afford to be sitting around and waiting. Luckily from my point of view, the club never managed to sign anybody. I guess that gave me an opportunity<br /><br /><b>[West Brom, chasing promotion from the Championship, came in with a loan offer. Tough decision?]</b> Not at all. I was desperate to go out. I just wanted to play. I didn’t care where it was, what division. You can only get to a certain level through training. I needed to be playing games. It was the best thing I ever did. You get a taste of playing, and you want more of it. It builds that hunger. If I had my time again, I’d 100 per cent go out on loan. Your career is short, and if you’re not playing then it’s easy for people to forget about you. I remember being in the Trafford Centre one Saturday when <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> were playing, and I hated it. There was nothing there for me. I wanted to be out and involved in games. I loved every second of my time at West Brom<br /><br />I always wanted to play at centre-back. But physically I probably wasn’t there. I’d know what was coming but I couldn’t stop it. I’d try and plant my body, but against a tough, physical striker it was tough. I just had to improve<br /><br />It wasn’t lifting massive weights for the sake of it. It was with performance in mind. I had to improve my core strength. I spent a lot of time in the gym, and I’ve noticed the difference. I’ve been up against most strikers this season and I feel like I can stand my ground a lot more now. That’s been a massive thing<br /><br /><b>[Everton’s form, of course, has been sketchy, bad enough for <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> to lose his job in December]</b> It’s been disappointing. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup]</b> was a low point, we came off after that game and we knew it wasn’t good enough. But there’s still an opportunity to end the season positively and get into that top five. It’s about your character, are you going to step up and be counted?<br /><br /><b>[Holgate is now being touted for a first senior England call-up]</b> Of course, it’s something that everybody aspires to. I’m no different, but ultimately it’s not my decision. All I can do is keep performing well for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, and if Gareth sees that and thinks I can bring something to England then I’ll be over the moon. But if I don’t get the chance, then that’s not going to derail me. I’ll carry on giving everything I can for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. But it’s just nice to be in the conversation I guess. Nobody would have even thought about me this time last year, so it just shows what can happen, I suppose!</p>

  <p><b>[Everton defender Mason Holgate, reportedly a transfer target for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, has signed a new contract]</b> This is my fifth year at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and my development as a person and a player in that period has been massive. The direction the club is going, it is a great club to be at and I am really excited about it. We want to move to the next step and push for bigger and better things. I want to win things - and winning some silverware is where I see us. It is definitely a positive time to be here and I am looking forward to seeing how far we can go<br /><br />Me personally, and I think I can speak for the rest of the boys, we’re not going to get pushed over and walked all over if something’s happening or needs to be said. We need to stand up strong and be part of that, and that’s not something that I’m scared to do. At the end of the day I want to win football games, I don’t want to be someone’s friend when I’m playing against them</p>
