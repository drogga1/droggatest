  <p><b>[Juventus’ Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> Striker Luca Toni Hits Out At Louis Van Gaal]</b> I had never experienced someone like him before. I remember how he once tried to make it clear that he wasn’t afraid to withdraw the so-called big names. He just dropped his pants to show us that he had the balls to do so. Fortunately, I didn’t sit front row so I didn’t see anything.<br /><br />He’s a crazy coach who doesn’t know how to treat his players. Guys like him and Felix Magath are coaches from another generation and can’t deal with the way players behave these days. Modern players want to communicate with their coach, but that’s not possible with Van Gaal. Everything goes the way he wants it to go.<br /><br />He always wanted the players to remains seated until everyone had finished breakfast. However, Italians only drink coffee for breakfast so I finished early and made myself comfortable. The coach then showed up behind me and started screaming and pulled me up. He told me that he was in charge and that I should leave if I didn’t like it</p>

  <p><b>[Toni to retire after <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> clash]</b> After thinking for a long time, I’ve decided that, after 22 years of football, the next game will be my last as a professional. I’ve realized that I have reached the end of the path. I’m a little emotional, it was a difficult and painful decision but I’ve come to the end of my playing career. I’ve been thinking about it for some weeks, they haven’t been easy weeks. At the Bentegodi against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> will be my last match. Any regrets? Not having won the Scudetto with Roma</p>

  <p><b>[It was Luca Toni who most memorably conveyed the extraordinary lengths to which <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> is prepared to go in order to make a point]</b> The coach wanted to make it clear to us that he can drop any player; that it was all the same to him because, as he said, he had the balls. He demonstrated this literally <b>[by dropping his trousers]</b>. I have never experienced anything like it; it was totally crazy<br /><br /><b>[Toni admitted himself that the final season of his 22-year career had been his worst. He had managed just five goals and Verona’s relegation to Serie B had already been confirmed]</b> When everything goes well it’s difficult to think about retiring. But this has been the worst season of my career, also on a mental level. The only way of stopping was to have a great disappointment and this year the disappointment for me was enormous. <br /><br />I’ll try to score on my last game. It would be the ultimate to end with a goal and victory in front of our fans. It was a risky Panenka penalty, but to do good things you need to take risks. Fortunately, it went well. Every goal in my career feels beautiful to me. Perhaps this evening’s is the best, as it closes my career with so many emotions wrapped up in it.<br /><br /><b>[When he moved to UAE in 2011 to join Al Nasr, it appeared that his top-flight career was over]</b> I should’ve retired four or five years ago. but I just kept scoring</p>

We were surrounded by 15 people, not fans and nothing to do with the good people of Avellino. What’s really disappointing is that 20 metres away were some police officers and they did nothing. I had thought with them around I’d feel protected, but they just stood there. Thanks to the driver, a friend of mine, we could <b>[get]</b> away. Football should be a celebration. This is shameful</p>

  <p><b>[According to former striker Luca Toni, he relentless brilliance of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> could see <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> enjoy a very successful season]</b> he relentless brilliance of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> could see <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> enjoy a very successful season. Let’s say this: it’s really hard to criticise <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>. He is a great player. Sometimes, it happens that he does not score. Team success basically comes through strikers’ goals. Here we have a strong striker like <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> and I am pretty sure he can lead <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> to success<br /><br /><b>[There are five teams on 10 points, including <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, leading Toni to hope for stronger competition this term as <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> go in search of an eighth title in a row]</b> The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> has to be a challenging league. In Italy, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> won the Scudetto last year with lots of games to go, and this often happens in Germany with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. I hope for all the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and the whole football movement for a very interesting league where three or more teams, maybe an underdog as well, are able to take results against the big teams<br /><br /><b>[Similarly, Toni is hoping for a stronger title fight in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> this season, with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>’s Inter and <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> tipped to challenge Juventus’ dominance of the top flight]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are the strongest. They have basically two teams made of 22 champions. It will be hard <b>[for other teams]</b> but Inter improved the squad in the market and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> completed their squad. It would be great for Italian football if those teams could fight for the Scudetto. They are the best: Inter, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and Juventus</p>

  <p><b>[Kane, <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> or Jesus? Luca Toni makes his pick as perfect partner for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> at Juventus]</b> <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>. A true centre-forward who fills the area like few others: he is technical, good at playing with the team and above all lethal in front of goal. And being 26, he still has room for growth<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> loanee <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>, who is still contracted to Inter, is at the same level as Kane]</b> No, a little further down. If <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> is 9 as an absolute value, <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> is 8. The <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> striker is the same age as the Englishman and he is a great finisher, but he is less complete, he must improve his team work. Having said that, the experience of sharing the attack with champions like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <b>[Kylian]</b> <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> has certainly improved Icardi<br /><br /><a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> is 8.5, <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> 7.5, Werner 7. It is true that the latter is a Germany international and is a revelation at Leipzig who have reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but he still has to demonstrate a lot more compared to a <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> or <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>. <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is very strong, he has had a super impact in Europe and at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> is continuing to score a lot of goals, as he did in Salzburg. But in a young person it is not so important to know how good he is now, but rather how much progress he will make in the next three years. If he grows at this rate, he will become a great centre-forward<br /><br />He is fast, technical, he makes assists. He would be the most suitable to play with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. That is because <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a> is not a pure centre-forward, he is the one who scores the most and must score the most goals. Another bomber, such as <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, who I consider the best of the under 30s, is not necessarily perfect for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. I see <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> being much better, someone who scores at City but also creates a lot, opens space for his team-mates, presses and is only 22 years old</p>
