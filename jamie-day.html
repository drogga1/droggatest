  <p><b>[Bangladesh head coach Jamie Day speaks about his journey with the Bengal Tigers]</b> I never really knew where Bangladesh was in the world. I looked it up, looked at the type of place that it was and, in a short space of time, it was: get up, leave family, move over to Bangladesh</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Day’s remarkable road to Dhaka]</b> It’s quite strange. Obviously in England, no-one has a clue who me or my staff are. But in Bangladesh people come up to us and take pictures. I enjoy it, we all do, but it was a bit weird at first to keep getting stopped all the time in the street for photos<br /><br />I got the call off a friend of mine who is an agent and he said the Bangladesh job was available. I put my CV in, then went and met them in London and then it was basically done. I didn’t even know where Bangladesh was in the world. I didn’t know what it was like or anything about the football. But I saw it as an international job and you don’t get a lot of chances to manage internationally<br /><br />It’s been an eye-opener. It’s a completely different world to the UK, but you adapt. Sometimes we haven’t had enough balls, bibs, stuff like that. I remember once we’d just played a World Cup game, got out the airport and onto the coach when suddenly all these police came around us. I thought they were taking us back to Dhaka, but they pulled us over and it turned out our driver was just a random person who didn’t have a license. We all had to get off and get cabs back. I was fuming at the time but we have got better at it over the two years and we’ve got things in place now that has ensured it has improved, but we need to improve further. The boys have done really well, they listen and they want to learn and that’s all you can really ask for. They’ve had some really good experiences now and over the two years we’ve made some big strides, but we want to continue doing that and to push on further<br /><br /><b>[During that time he was training regularly with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s first team and made the bench for a game against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a> in February, 1998]</b> We won 1-0 and Giles Grimandi scored. The squad was quite bare at the time and Arsene patched up a team to get out there and we managed to get the win, which was obviously great for us being on the bench<br /><br />Arsene came in and changed the club and philosophy and obviously made it a much better place. For us, it was good to see new ideas and how things were done from a foreign coach. But obviously the flip side of it was the players he was bringing in were elite level and for us younger lads we were never going to get the opportunity to get into the first team. But to train with those players and to see them on a daily basis was a great experience as well. Just training with players like <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> was something that a lot of people didn’t get the opportunity to do. Dennis was miles better than anyone else. I remember <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a> was very good as well, but the things Dennis did in training and his vision and awareness was a step up<br /><br />Looking back, what I probably should have done is got myself really fit and pushed myself to stay in that environment and train with those players for longer. Then maybe I should gave gone to a club that was in the Championship or another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club where I might have had a better chance of getting into the first team. I think I got a bit lazy. Instead of thinking I needed to get fitter or do a bit extra to give myself a chance, I sort of went the other way. For a footballer I was a bit heavy and I shouldn’t have been. I didn’t stay out in the afternoons to do extra because I just thought I wasn’t going to make it at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I was playing reserves games once a week and sort of downed tools a little bit. I left for the first club that came in for me when I should maybe have took my time selecting the right club for how I played and the level. Maybe that is the only regret</p>
