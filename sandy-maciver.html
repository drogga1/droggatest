  <p><b>[The call-up is in keeping with how thick and fast things have come since Sandy MacIver returned to her home country]</b> I didn’t expect it to fall like it did, but it was good. I enjoyed it. My mum and dad were more nervous than I was for the game. I don’t think they could speak to each other in the car! <b>[Being with England]</b> is just a completely different environment, especially comparing it to the youth teams. Everything on the pitch is quicker, and it’s just like trying to step up to that level. Since being back at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, this environment kind of replicates that environment. You didn’t really get that in America. I think for a while I knew I wanted to come back to England - it was just a matter of where. To be honest, I think anywhere in England, <b>[my mum and dad]</b> were happy. It’s closer than 3000 miles away in America!<br /><br /><b>[Biscuits and teabags were among the necessities brought over]</b> In America, they just have naff biscuits. Nothing really beats a hobnob or a digestive in your tea does it? - while the family visits were always appreciated too. My mum came out <b>[for my graduation too]</b> and my boyfriend. You have a ceremony where they celebrate the athletes and I had to do a speech. It was nerve-wracking! But I got through it. It was like four or five minutes. I’m just rubbish at that. I got my boyfriend to write it and people laughed so it was alright<br /><br /><b>[when she earned her first senior call-up and it’s where she grew up as a player and a person]</b> Our coach emphasised playing out from the back, so it was taking that aspect of my game to another level. <b>[I was]</b> away from home for the first time too. A lot of people had the support that they could go back home and they weren’t too far away, whereas if I was ever in that situation, I couldn’t just fly home. I think it was just kind of growing up in fast mode really<br /><br /><b>[Asked what she missed the most about England during her four years]</b> You can’t go to the shop in America and get a sandwich, it just doesn’t exist. You have to get like a six-foot subway</p>
