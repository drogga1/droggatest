  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid winger Gelson Martins has completed a permanent transfer to Monaco after spending the second half of last season on loan with the Ligue 1 outfit]</b> I am very happy to be able to join Monaco in time and I am now very much looking forward to seeing the group again in preparation for the upcoming season. Despite the difficult situation, we managed to show some good things last season and I will do everything to help the club achieve its goals this season</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco star Gelson Martins earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> AS Monaco takes note of the decision of the Disciplinary Committee of the LFP to sanction Gelson Martins with a suspension of six months dating to February 6, a very heavy sanction. The club once again condemns the unjustifiable behavior of its attacker, but also regrets the excessive length of this suspension, for a player who has never served a disciplinary ban in more than 200 games at the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco star Gelson Martins earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> In light of the nature of the events, the Disciplinary Committee, on February 6, 2020, suspended the player as a precautionary measure. After examining the evidence and hearing the player’s arguments, the Committee has decided to sanction Gelson Martins with a suspension of six months. That decision takes effect from February 6, 2020</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco star Gelson Martins earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> Anyone who knows me knows that throughout my career I have held respect for everyone as a principle - my team-mates, opponents, fans and officials - off the field and on it, where I have never been aggressive against anyone. I feel I must apologise for my attitude which was unwarranted and product of a moment of anger. I apologise in particular to the referee Mikael Lesage, but also to my team-mates and our fans</p>
