  <p><b>[Gelson Martins has agreed a five-year deal at Atletico Madrid after opting to walk away from crisis club Sporting CP]</b> Our club is incorporating a pacey right winger who has also been deployed as a second striker and even at right-back. His speed and fine dribbling skills make him a valued addition to our team and a threat to the opposition’s defenders.</p>

  <p><b>[Gelson Martins proving Monaco’s saviour]</b> I saw Robinho on TV and I tried to copy everything that he did. I was fast like him. I always pretended to be him on the street<br /><br />I knew the club and certain players that are here, and that’s helped me integrate. The situation of the club is an additional source of motivation for me. I came with a lot of desire to help the team and I hope we can win our next matches to get out of this position</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> star Gelson Martins earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> <a href="monaco-fc.html">AS Monaco</a> takes note of the decision of the Disciplinary Committee of the LFP to sanction Gelson Martins with a suspension of six months dating to February 6, a very heavy sanction. The club once again condemns the unjustifiable behavior of its attacker, but also regrets the excessive length of this suspension, for a player who has never served a disciplinary ban in more than 200 games at the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> star Gelson Martins earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> Anyone who knows me knows that throughout my career I have held respect for everyone as a principle - my team-mates, opponents, fans and officials - off the field and on it, where I have never been aggressive against anyone. I feel I must apologise for my attitude which was unwarranted and product of a moment of anger. I apologise in particular to the referee Mikael Lesage, but also to my team-mates and our fans</p>
