  <p>[FFV Media and Communications Manager Teo Pellizzeri, who doubles as lead commentator on Flip TV’s NPL Victoria broadcasts, was thrilled with the debut game] The initial reaction has been very positive. The production values and editorial quality of the broadcast has been widely praised and the game itself between Kingston City and Bentleigh Greens certainly delivered for action and goals. This Friday we look forward to broadcasting Melbourne Knights versus Heidelberg United and giving those two clubs national exposure and a high-quality broadcast production.<br /><br />There is no doubt the Westfield FFA Cup has helped to bring football from the second tier and below back into the national discussion, and it is already a positive legacy of the FFA Cup that interest in PlayStation 4 NPL competitions is growing</p>

  <p>[Andrew McLeish of Sportscast Australia, who produced Monday’s broadcast, believes the growth of streaming via Internet protocol television providers like Flip TV will only benefit sports or leagues that traditional broadcasters aren’t interested in] The ability now to create platforms away from your standard free-to-air or even your cable, paid subscription TV has certainly opened up in the last 24 months but definitely in the last 12 months. Consumers’ behaviour with media now is a lot more mobile and not the traditional form. So I’m not surprised that it’s taken this long because the door’s just opened but I think from here on we’ll find a lot of content being produced in this fashion where it’s a scale down from TV but ideal for those platforms where people are looking to consume niche content.</p>

  <p>[NSW Waratahs have rejected Football Federation Australia’s request they move their Super Rugby game away from Allianz Stadium on Saturday to protect the pitch for the A-League grand final] While consideration was given to the request made by NSW government late on Monday 1 May, out of interest for the NSW Waratahs fans and supporters as well as other stakeholders, the game will remain at the Tahs’ home ground, Allianz Stadium.</p>
