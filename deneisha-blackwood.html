  <p><b>[Jamaica’s Deneisha Blackwood talks Slavia Prague shocks &amp; World Cup dreams]</b> Oh, you know, apart from being cold and the language, I think it has been a great experience so far<br /><br />Growing up it was kind of hard for me because my mum was a single mum of five and she didn’t really have anybody to help her grow us. She started working when she had me, I was the last one, but I think everything happens for a reason. Even though it was hard, I decided I wasn’t going to let it define who I am<br /><br />Mother always used to tell me you can’t go outside and play with the boys and I would hide and still go. Now she’s like, ‘I’m glad she didn’t listen to me! Now she’s doing something that she loves’.<br /><br /><b>[Blackwood said of the Reggae Boyz appearance, which came when she was just a one-year-old]</b> I’ve heard it was crazy. I’ve heard they actually got a public holiday for qualifying. This is not something we experience every time when the World Cup comes around. I feel like it’s very important for us as a country to see us girls going there. I think it made the country go wild.<br /><br />Not all the teams who went for the first time scored and I think even though our games didn’t go as we planned, that moment was just so incredible for us. Knowing that we went there and got the group of death, but we still managed to get at least one goal… I think that will always be my most memorable moment there. That was unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[With less than an hour of the first game in Prague played, this leg looked like it would be almost a formality, with the scoreline reading 5-0 to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a>. But Slavia pulled two goals back late on to keep themselves in contention of causing an unlikely upset]</b> It was a tough loss, but the experience was just so great. For us to stand up to a team like that, was really great. I think that’s the good thing about being a part of this team. We’re very determined, and so even though we were down by five, we didn’t stop. I feel like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, they expected us to just give up. But we didn’t, we hold our heads high and try to come out proud</p>

  <p><b>[In an interview before the World Cup, Deneisha Blackwood’s mother sat proudly in her home, surrounded by Blackwood’s trophies from her journey through school]</b> I’ll be so proud when I see her play in France. It’ll be the proudest day of my life</p>
