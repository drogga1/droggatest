  <p><b>[Dom Dwyer getting everything in order to pave his way to play for USA]</b> On Feb. 14 it marks five years of me having my green card, so I will be eligible for citizenship on that date, and then paperwork is sitting on the side waiting to be sent on that day - and then we’ll see how quickly the process goes from there.<br /><br />Almost every interview I’ve done today I’ve been asked the question <b>[about the U.S. national team]</b>, so I’m starting to think about it a little bit more today. I think it’s a dream of any footballer to play on the international stage, so to be in that conversation, for me, is an absolute honor, whereas if I’d been sitting here five years ago nobody here would really know who I was. That’s a big, big honor for me. Really, I’m focusing on this season, and playing well, and I know if I play well and work hard then things will take care of themselves usually<br /><br />I have been in contact, we’ve had conversations. We’re working toward that. There’s regulations you have to work through with FIFA, so we’re getting there<br /><br />When I was growing up I always dreamed of playing in the Premier League. That was it for me, it was the top thing. Now that I came across to America it wasn’t really my plan, but I’ve started to establish myself here and I’m really enjoying myself. The dream is always to play at the highest level, whether that’s internationally or different leagues or different countries, whatever. I really don’t know what the future holds. I enjoy playing for Kansas City, I love being in MLS, I love this league. I have aspirations to do big things, whether that is going to Europe or elsewhere, I think that’s something that will happen depending on how I perform, how well I play, how I improve. Right now I’m just focusing on being a better player. I want to get there, and if an opportunity arises, who knows in football?<br /><br />That’s a strong side you’ve got there, there’s some fantastic players in that squad. I’m just working hard and playing well, and if I’m selected and if I’m on it I hope I can get an opportunity and take it<br /><br />I’ve been here about nine years now, so it’s almost like my second home, if not my home. I love this country, it’s given a lot to me, so if I ever have the opportunity to give something back to it, I think that’s something I’d always jump</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City forward Dom Dwyer is officially a U.S. citizen after completing his naturalization ceremony Thursday]</b> This country has given me a lot over the past five years, and I look forward to giving back as much as possible. I want to thank everyone who has supported me on this journey, most importantly my family and my club. This was a very meaningful day for me, and I’m excited to start the next chapter of my life as a U.S. citizen.<br /><br /><b>[Dwyer is now poised to join a U.S. forward pool that includes Bobby Wood, Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, Jordan Morris, Gyasi Zardes, Chris Wondolowski and Juan Agudelo]</b> That’s a strong side you’ve got there, there’s some fantastic players in that squad. I’m just working hard and playing well, and if I’m selected and if I’m on it, I hope I can get an opportunity and take it</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City forward Dom Dwyer on his USA national team debut]</b> It’s a huge honor. I’ve been raring to go for a while, and I hope that I can put in a good showing. It’s a really good group, I’m excited to be with this group, and I’m just raring to go when called upon.</p>

  <p><b>[Newly-minted citizen Dom Dwyer shines in U.S. national team debut]</b> It meant a lot to me. t’s been a long road to get here. I really wanted to show the fans and show the country that I’m very passionate about this country and that I’m very honored to play for this team. Hopefully, it’s something we can build on.<br /><br />I was always confident in my ability <b>[but]</b> I don’t know if I ever expected it this way. It’s a great story and hopefully it can continue</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City coming together behind new goal-scoring tandem]</b> It’s a dream. I admired <b>[Sacha Kljestan]</b> him for a long time playing against him. He gave Bradley Wright-Phillips that Golden Boot off me a few years back. He promised me one for me so we’re working towards that<br /><br />I think we showed some character in the last few weeks, which is pretty important, especially at this point in the season. I think we’ve shown that this team is capable of special things too. Of course we made some mistakes early on in the game, but Joe made some fantastic saves. We battled and I think we deserved to win<br /><br />We’re just trying to gel. Obviously it’s our first clean sheet, which is very important to us. We’re starting to figure things out. We took a while to get going at the start of the season, but we’re starting to hit our stride and you haven’t seen our best yet</p>
