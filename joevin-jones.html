  <p>[Joevin Jones to leave Seattle for German side SV Darmstadt] I am very happy about the opportunity to prove myself at Darmstadt 98. It is a big step in my career, which I absolutely want to make use of.</p>

  <p>[Joevin Jones ready to leave MLS to pursue European dreams. Darmstadt was interested in Jones’ services] I was in touch with them since January. The Bundesliga is a league I looked up to as a player, like Spain’s La Liga and the Premier League.<br /><br />I’m looking forward to it. It’s a high level. I’m excited to join the team but also to play in Europe and test my ability to see where I am at the moment in my career<br /><br />It was an honor to win the title. As a player you always want to achieve certain goals and when I first came into the league that was one of my goals - to win the league, and I did it with Seattle and [it made me] very proud as a player<br /><br />I think this year, winning the [MLS] Cup last year meant more focus from me and more hard work. So that’s what I did through all preseason and also up to now, a little extra more, that can help me to be at my top game<br /><br />For me, growing up, I always wanted to go over to Europe and I had that chance. And I’m the right age to go over to Europe right now so I took the chance. I tried to stay at Seattle but things didn’t work out between me and the GM [Garth Lagerwey], contract-wise. The opportunity came along, so I grabbed it.<br /><br />I think everyone is excited. Everyone wants to qualify for the World Cup for the second time for the country. I think the players’ mood is right and I think we’re on the right page as players<br /><br />To be a top player. To be that player every coach is talking about in the dressing room to keep their eye on, and also to win the championship again. And also to have more assists<br /><br />Just to be the same Joevin Jones or even better and help them accomplish their goal that they have set for the season</p>
