  <p><b>[Troy Parrott’s former Belvedere manager Austin Skelly]</b> I played with Belvo, my brother played with Belvo and then my son was playing, which is how I got involved with the academy. We had really good players and Troy was just one of them. But he was a street footballer, he had something you could see straight away.<br /><br />He was banging in the goals for Stella and you’re always looking for a striker. It was only five-a-side and seven-a-side back then as they were only kids but you could see his skills. His talent and his attitude stood out. He just loved playing football. From minute one he just wanted to play football.<br /><br />We had him from under 9. I remember the first time he came along and he was a big lad for his age and like myself being from the area, he was used to playing with older kids on the street. We were only setting up and he turned around and said to me, ‘Is this the right age? They’re all like kids’. So that’s what he was like physically and playing ball he was a good bit ahead at the very start.<br /><br />He was infectious, the lads in the dressing room respected him. He was really talented but really grounded. It was like an arrogance he had on the pitch but not off it. Lads looked up to him. He made lads improve around him but it was vice versa as well<br /><br />I had played football and had opportunities from it and that’s why we’re in it, to make these kids better and help them on their way. Over the years it was one of those situations where all the clubs were after him but between his family, his mum and myself and Darragh as coaches, we kind of helped him along the way<br /><br />There’s not much for the kids. In my opinion, football’s a way out. There’s not many opportunities or options around the area. I know Wes (Hoolahan) well, he was a year younger than me at Belvo and it was the same thing. As kids, we’d play football down in Fairview Park and I’m sure Troy was the same<br /><br />There’s not much for the kids. In my opinion, football’s a way out.

As kids, we’d play football down in Fairview Park and I’m sure Troy was the same<br /><br />You realise when you get older that you could have gone down a different road. There’s plenty of players and plenty of kids that took another road. But plenty of others that didn’t<br /><br />There are many factors but in Troy’s case, one thing I’ve learned is he had that attitude and desire to be a footballer more than anything. Obviously, there were situations where others weren’t doing the right things but he had the right attitude of listening to his family and to people that were around him<br /><br />Even where I’m from in Croke Villas, there were five lads in the same block of flats who had opportunities to do something in football across the water. It’s a football-based area. There’s Belvo, Home Farm are close. That’s why many people have come through<br /><br /><b>[As Skelly recollected, it was a trip for a tournament in Germany with Belvedere where that ability first caught attention]</b> We went over to a tournament in Germany at under 12s. One of the players’ mothers was from Poland and she was football-mad. She emailed this elite tournament in Germany and we ended up getting invited. We played against Werder Bremen, Kaiserslautern, Stuttgart, <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>. Elite teams<br /><br />That was the first look at Troy against that level. We got them over for a week and were teaching all the kids how to look after yourselves when you’re away. Going to bed early, looking after yourselves with fluids, etc.<br /><br />He tore the tournament to shreds, he was unbelievable. I’m not joking, the things he was doing. After the tournament ended, myself and Darragh were talking and we couldn’t believe what we were seeing. He was the best player in the tournament by a mile<br /><br />He adapts, he has everything. He can fight, he can play any type of role. We had him in the <a href="emmanuel-macron.html">Macron</a> Cup in Galway and it’s different, you’re battling against country teams. And then he goes away to Germany and football-wise, he was two steps ahead of everyone tactically. He just went up another two or three gears. We had German coaches raving about him<br /><br />I’ve played myself and seen players but I’ve never seen anything like him in my life. Tony Lynch is a coach at Belvo who’s there over 30 years and he’ll tell you he’s never seen anything like it<br /><br />It doesn’t matter who he’s playing against. Some of the things he was doing on the pitch, you can still see when he’s playing for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and Ireland now. He has top coaches at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> but it’s off-the-cuff stuff, it’s stuff you can’t teach. That’s raw talent. It’s a pleasure to sit here having coached him and have the memories</p>

  <p><b>[Troy Parrott’s journey to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> by those who know him best]</b> He had this ability to take it up another level in big games. It was unbelievable, that was the weekend I knew he was a different quality to anyone I had seen before. It’s not about winning at Belvo. It’s about teaching the game to the kids. We got a bit of stick as coaches about it but we looked at the all-round game. Growing up Troy would have played in every position - defence, midfield and out wide as well as up front- to understand the game. When you’re young you don’t want to learn the other side of the game but with Troy, I wanted to nail that. It didn’t take much, a couple of reminders at the start about attitude and learning different parts of it</p>
