  <p>[USA Soccer president Gulati not focused on World Cup bid amid Trump’s immigration ban] Sports obviously involves international movement and free movement of players, of ideas. How this plays out in terms of international events, I think that’s frankly a secondary issue right now. The issue involving the executive order and its implications are far broader than that.<br /><br />We’re challenged by a number of things that are going on in the world. So let’s see how those play out over the next few weeks before we make any decision about co-hosting or going alone or bidding at all. I saw Michael’s comments yesterday and they were clearly heartfelt. Absolutely no issue whatsoever</p>

  <p>[Donald Trump’s meddling is more likely to sink USA World Cup hosting hopes than help] I think the world’s perception of the United States is affected by who’s in the White House, yes, and so it has some bearing, sure. We’re going to bid for a World Cup if we think we’re going to be successful. I think whether we can be successful in a World Cup bid, or LA in an Olympic bid, is affected by the world’s view of our leaders. And not just the leaders of the soccer federation.<br /><br />[Gulati said of the bid process] This will be a tough battle. This is not only about our stadiums and our hotels and all that. It’s about perceptions of America and it’s a difficult time in the world. So, there’s only certain things we control. We can’t control what happens with the 38th parallel in Korea. We can’t control what happens with embassies in Tel Aviv. We can’t control what happens with climate change accords. We do the best we can. We have the support of Washington. We’ll now have to go out and convince what will eventually be 104 voters to vote for us. This won’t be easy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[American soccer does not have promotion and relegation] There’s a reason FIFA didn’t make it mandatory when they passed the rule a decade ago. And by the way, it wasn’t about the sporting merit. FIFA’s rule came into play because what happened in Spain and some other places was the team that got relegated, the owner of that team quickly bought the team that went up, changed all the uniforms, changed all the players, and then went back to the first division. That isn’t sporting merit.<br /><br />[In MLS], there’s a whole bunch of people that came in under one set of rules, and some have paid $150m and built a stadium for another $250m under a certain set of rules. If they sit down and start this other league and say, ‘we want to do promotion/relegation’ for all the reasons that people think are positive, fantastic. We as a federation aren’t going to legislate that. Anyone who thinks they can without everyone’s agreement is going to end up with nine [Supreme Court] judges in Washington for sure</p>
