  <p><b>[USA Soccer president Gulati not focused on World Cup bid amid Trump’s immigration ban]</b> Sports obviously involves international movement and free movement of players, of ideas. How this plays out in terms of international events, I think that’s frankly a secondary issue right now. The issue involving the executive order and its implications are far broader than that.<br /><br />We’re challenged by a number of things that are going on in the world. So let’s see how those play out over the next few weeks before we make any decision about co-hosting or going alone or bidding at all. I saw Michael’s comments yesterday and they were clearly heartfelt. Absolutely no issue whatsoever</p>

  <p><b>[USA Soccer president explains how Trump’s executive order could impact 2026 World Cup bid]</b> I don’t think the executive order that has been issued is consistent with a lot of American values. There’s two images when you think about New York that maybe come into play for people here, and they’re both downtown around New York harbor. One is the memorial from 9/11, which still is in a lot of people’s minds and raises security concerns where it’s not a question of whether they’re rational or less rational, but those are concerns for people. So security is obviously something that’s very important to us.<br /><br />Obviously, the other major image is that poem on the Statue of Liberty. I think while there’s always a balance between those things, everything America stands for in terms of openness, in terms of being welcoming, is challenged by such an executive order. It’s going to be challenged and has been challenged successfully already in courts. And my guess is you’re going to see modifications in that. So it doesn’t represent what I believe is the best of us. My guess is some years from now a lot of people will look back at this and say we shouldn’t have done that.<br /><br />Sports obviously involves international movement and free movement of players, of ideas. How this plays out in terms of international events, I think that’s frankly a secondary issue right now. The issue involving the executive order and its implications are far broader than that<br /><br />I think it’s too early to know that. But hopefully the executive order will either be modified or we’ve talked about a 90-day period and we’ll get back if not sooner to the values we have. I think the bigger issue is what it says about the country in the eyes of other people.<br /><br />There are two things. One is the short-term effects of movement of people and so on, and the protests you’re seeing … And two is how people then view the United States. What I mean by that is some countries may turn around and say we’ll have an equal sort of policy now on your visitors to our country. That’s one issue. That’s the short-term implications. The longer one is how it changes the view of people of the United States as a world leader in these areas, as an open country, as an example, a shining light if you will. That’s certainly a concern. What I’m certainly hoping is the short-term nature of this or possible modification or reversal or elimination will help us to dampen those long-term views</p>

  <p><b>[USA Mexico and Canada announce joint 2026 World Cup bid]</b> This is a milestone day for U.S. Soccer and for CONCACAF. We gave careful consideration to the prospect of bidding for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and ultimately feel strongly this is the right thing for our region and for our sport. Along with our partners from the Canadian Soccer Association and the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol, we are confident that we will submit an exemplary bid worthy of bringing the FIFA World Cup back to North America. The United States, Mexico and Canada have individually demonstrated their exceptional abilities to host world-class events. When our nations come together as one, as we will for 2026, there is no question the United States, Mexico and Canada will deliver an experience that will celebrate the game and serve players, supporters and partners alike.</p>

  <p><b>[Gulati says Joint World Cup bid a ‘positive signal’ for unification]</b> It makes our bid stronger, in terms of the 209 members that eventually decide. There’s a pragmatic part of it, and that’s the pragmatic part. We clearly between the three countries have 40, 50 stadiums that meet FIFA’s qualifications and criteria, as well as cities and hotels and air. The other part of it is we think it’s terrific for football in the region and soccer in region, both for Canada, Mexico and the U.S., given the close relationships we have already.<br /><br />We think in this interesting world in which we live and the place we’re holding this particular press conference and the Statue of Liberty outside, and a whole bunch of things along those lines, from a social perspective it’s a positive. We don’t believe that sport can solve all of the issues of the world, but especially with what’s going on in the world today, we think this is a hugely positive signal and symbol of what we can do together in unifying people, especially in our three countries</p>

  <p><b>[USA Soccer president Sunil Gulati walked away looking like the big winner Monday, but even he suggested the U.S. wound up sacrificing in the negotiations]</b> I think it’s safe to say both <b>[Canada and Mexico]</b> would have liked more <b>[games]</b>, and they would say it was probably hard to sell me on 60. In the end, it was a discussion, a negotiation, but a very friendly one. This wasn’t, ‘OK, we’re walking away - do it with the other one,’ or any of that. It was quite friendly, but not easy because it’s a zero sum game on the number of games obviously.<br /><br />The key principles in that discussions were that we felt that we should host the lion’s share of the games, and if we went alone we had potentially the strongest bid. Mexico and Canada had then to assess the same thing we did, the likelihood and so on. We wanted also - all three of us - parity between Canada and Mexico because we’re true partners in this. There was a lot of negotiating about it, and at different numbers one or more of us may have chosen to bid alone<br /><br />Because I couldn’t get the round of 16 all in the U.S. Negotiation. Bigger stadiums generally - Azteca <b>[in Mexico City]</b> is obviously a bigger stadium. Those all came down to a discussion, and that’s where we ended up<br /><br />If you have a 90 percent <b>[chance]</b> - or whatever the numbers are, I’m not saying it’s 90 percent - of getting 75 percent of the tournament, or a 75 percent chance of getting 100 percent, what do you do? That was part of the analysis and calculus, but the other part was we think there’s a benefit beyond football, beyond soccer, to a joint bid, especially with Mexico - which, as I mentioned, is fully supported by the president, which is a big plus<br /><br />A World Cup in North America, with 60 games in the United States, will be, by far, the most successful World Cup in the history of FIFA in terms of economics. The economic power of the American market - we’ve got 500 million people in these three countries - this will be an extraordinarily successful World Cup on financial and economic grounds. That’s critical because most of FIFA’s revenue comes from one event. The 209 people voting all get funds from FIFA, and so they should also recognized that FIFA’s finances - on which many countries rely - will be greatly enhanced by a tournament in North America</p>

  <p><b>[Donald Trump’s meddling is more likely to sink USA World Cup hosting hopes than help]</b> I think the world’s perception of the United States is affected by who’s in the White House, yes, and so it has some bearing, sure. We’re going to bid for a World Cup if we think we’re going to be successful. I think whether we can be successful in a World Cup bid, or LA in an Olympic bid, is affected by the world’s view of our leaders. And not just the leaders of the soccer federation.<br /><br /><b>[Gulati said of the bid process]</b> This will be a tough battle. This is not only about our stadiums and our hotels and all that. It’s about perceptions of America and it’s a difficult time in the world. So, there’s only certain things we control. We can’t control what happens with the 38th parallel in Korea. We can’t control what happens with embassies in Tel Aviv. We can’t control what happens with climate change accords. We do the best we can. We have the support of Washington. We’ll now have to go out and convince what will eventually be 104 voters to vote for us. This won’t be easy</p>

  <p><b>[American soccer does not have promotion and relegation]</b> There’s a reason FIFA didn’t make it mandatory when they passed the rule a decade ago. And by the way, it wasn’t about the sporting merit. FIFA’s rule came into play because what happened in Spain and some other places was the team that got relegated, the owner of that team quickly bought the team that went up, changed all the uniforms, changed all the players, and then went back to the first division. That isn’t sporting merit.<br /><br /><b>[In MLS]</b>, there’s a whole bunch of people that came in under one set of rules, and some have paid $150m and built a stadium for another $250m under a certain set of rules. If they sit down and start this other league and say, ‘we want to do promotion/relegation’ for all the reasons that people think are positive, fantastic. We as a federation aren’t going to legislate that. Anyone who thinks they can without everyone’s agreement is going to end up with nine <b>[Supreme Court]</b> judges in Washington for sure</p>
