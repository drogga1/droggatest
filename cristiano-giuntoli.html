  <p><b>[sporting director <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> Giuntoli says <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> expect <a href="dries-mertens.html">Dries Mertens</a> to sign a new contract but Jose Callejon could leave the club]</b> Things are moving forward with <a href="dries-mertens.html">Mertens</a>. There’s a will on both sides to continue together. We hope to formalise the renewal shortly. With Callejon, we’re waiting. He hasn’t decided what he wants to do with his future. Both of them have given a lot to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. We’re talking, and the climate is calm. The Spaniard is an exemplary professional. If he leaves, he’ll finish the season with us, anyway<br /><br /><b>[Giuntoli also hopes to see <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a> commit to a longer-term deal]</b> Rino has brought a lot. The will of the club is to carry on with him. Unfortunately, he was hit by a very serious loss, and we’re all shaken. It’s a delicate moment. We’ll go on together - I think that’s obvious<br /><br /><b>[Another <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> player to be linked with a move away is <a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Fabian Ruiz</a>]</b> <a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Fabian Ruiz</a> has a three-year contract and we’ll talk next year about a renewal. I think he’ll stay with Napoli</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> have warned they will not allow <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> to leave in a cut-price deal]</b> He is a great footballer and the club has the right to ask for the price it wants. They say negotiations will change, but in my opinion this is an alibi. I don’t think the coronavirus issue can change the price of <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> or other top players. Certainly, however, we’ll come to appreciate the contractual formula such as the loan with an option to buy, which help to postpone the guarantees and ease the balance immediately. Football can adapt quickly.<br /><br /><b>[Giuntoli also had words of praise for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> coach <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a>, whose sister passed away earlier this week]</b> We immediately appreciated the technical and human qualities of <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a>. There is a strong desire to continue with him and we are planning the team of the future together, to return to compete for the championship. Obviously, this is a very delicate moment, we are all a little shaken and my thoughts go to him and his parents. Rino’s work is not only appreciated by the club, but also by the players who are doing very well in his 4-3-3. For example, <a href="lorenzo-insigne.html">Lorenzo Insigne</a> is in love with Napoli: he still has two years on his contract and our common will is to return to the field stronger than before. The same applies to Fabian Ruiz: in he is happy here, I think he will stay and we will discuss his renewal from next year</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="dries-mertens.html">Mertens</a> sets <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> goalscoring record as Belgian star closes on new contract]</b> I know the lawyers are working on it, he wants to stay and we intend to keep him, so there’s only one result that can come from that. It’s important to be back on the field and a great sign for society at large too. We are in the semi-final, had a great first-leg performance and want to keep that going by reaching the final</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> director of sport Cristiano Giuntoli insists they want to ‘continue together’ with <a href="hirving-lozano.html">Hirving Lozano</a> and admits negotiations were ‘tough’ for <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Victor Osimhen</a>]</b> I remember <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Osimhen</a> in the Under-17 World Cup and he had a great tournament. It was a tough negotiation process because it was done at a distance, so clearly we didn’t get the usual sense of whether this was going to work or not. Thankfully, it all went well. It was an expensive investment, but we are convinced he will do very well<br /><br />We believe Chucky <a href="hirving-lozano.html">Lozano</a> can only do better, so the desire is to continue together</p>
