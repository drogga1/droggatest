  <p><b>[Stefano Pioli criticised the mentality of his fragile Inter side after they crashed out of Europe on Thursday, losing 3-2 at Hapoel Be-er Sheva having led 2-0]</b> We stopped playing as a team and were presumptuous. That should never happen and we cannot afford to do that if we want to win games. We had the chance to go 3-0 up and didn’t take it. We must work hard to ensure we don’t keep giving away certain opportunities. We cannot play such a two-faced match. In the first half we did really well, badly in the second. All we needed to do was maintain that attitude<br /><br />In fitness terms we’re ok, as we pushed at the end. What matters here is the mentality and we must improve. The past no longer counts, what matters is the present and we cannot be satisfied with our work. We are working on all fronts: physical, psychological and tactical. A team that plays that well in the first half cannot offer a second-half performance like that.<br /><br />Inter have players of great quality, but we need to know how to suffer under pressure. The performance was not worthy of Inter. We got too deep and allowed Hapoel back into the game. I changed a few things, trying to recover the balance that we had lost</p>

  <p><b>[Stefano Pioli lamented Inter’s slow start as they suffered a 3-0 Serie A loss at Napoli on Friday]</b> It is a step backwards compared to recent matches, as above all the initial approach made all the difference against a quality side like Napoli.<br /><br />Conceding two goals at the San Paolo so early means it is difficult to get back into the game. We did have opportunities to score, but we failed to convert them.<br /><br />We need more care and determination in defence, so that will take time. Napoli have quality players and moved the ball well. I think Jose Callejon was perhaps offside on the first goal, but even then we should’ve covered Piotr Zielinski’s run better.<br /><br />We are working on the tactical, physical and psychological levels. We lost our balance and took the wrong approach. I also saw positioning errors on the goals we conceded</p>

  <p><b>[Inter coach Stefano Pioli is wary of entertaining a Genoa side that have already beaten AC Milan and Juventus in Serie A]</b> Ivan Juric has done a fantastic job this season. Genoa play with real grit and determination and they’ve done well against the big teams. They also have the second-best defence in Serie A. If we want to beat them, we’ll need focus, clear heads and resolved. Winning would be a huge result in terms of our league position and for morale. We really want these three points. December is going to be a busy month but we have to take each game as it comes. There are still plenty of points to play for. We have to stay focused on the present.<br /><br />The fans made their feelings known and we have to accept the criticism. We won on Thursday and now we have to make sure we honour every game from here until the end of the season. We must work hard every day to build confidence and bring joy to our fans. You won’t go very far unless every player is pulling their weight and running for the team from the first minute to the last. When we’re not in possession, we must work hard as an organised unit</p>

  <p><b>[On Roberto Gagliardini]</b> He’s a complete midfielder. He has positional sense, he knows how to move. I’ve asked him to get forward and he’s doing well in both phases of the game.He could be like Tardelli, though Marco was more agile and quicker. Roberto, on the other hand, is taller and more physical. He’s still completing his journey, he’s still young but he’s showing that he’ll be useful for the present and definitely for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefano Pioli says Inter striker Mauro Icardi is better than his Juventus counterpart Gonzalo Higuain]</b> Icardi… We need to be effective, we have to be a team. I do not think there is one decisive aspect: when we play with intensity, pace and work for each other. If we do that we are a strong and competitive team. We will have to approach the game with strength, conviction and effectiveness. Juventus are the team who score more in the first 10 minutes, we score more in the last 15. We’ll see what will happen. We have to be very careful about the details and distances, but we should be paying attention to the second balls, they may important to help us hurt them in attack.<br /><br />Juventus are a strong team, they have the mentality, the team and the coach. If there is a team that can make things difficult, it is Inter. They have certain qualities and we have ours. We will try to do well. This meeting will be important in understanding the distance between the two teams. I think it will be a good challenge<br /><br />I’m used to this very life, to know the strengths and weaknesses of this profession. When I was at home I watched football and I traveled to follow the coaches that I like more. I waited for the right situation and arrived. Inter have arrived at the right time and I had the opportunity to coach a great team with great fans. This is my big chance</p>

  <p><b>[Emotional Davide Astori tribute paid by Stefano Pioli]</b> The first thought goes to Davide, who I was fortunate enough to know over the last few months. He was special as both a person and a captain. He always found the right way and time to say things. He was generous, positive, altruistic. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to spend much time with him and I’ll miss him. I miss him every day I step on to that training ground. Our thoughts are with his family. I don’t know what to say to <b>[partner]</b> Francesca and <b>[daughter]</b> Vittoria, other than we will always be there for them<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the scenes at Astori’s funeral service, Pioli drew strength from the show of solidarity from the club’s supporters]</b> Our fans have a huge heart. I wanted to hug each and every one of them to console them and let them console us, so together we could find the strength to go on. We thank the whole football world, because such participation and solidarity is certainly down to Davide, but also means that there are still principles and values in a world that at times is described differently. Our club owners again showed their sensitivity and did everything possible to help the team. We are crying and suffering, because Davide was our reference point, but we know what to do in order to honour his memory. I usually like to motivate players by telling them: ‘Try to train and play as if it was the last time.’ I never needed to say that to Davide. He has left us so many values, that seed of passion, professionalism and sensitivity. Now it’s up to us to look after it and help that seed grow. All united, in memory of Davide</p>

Of course, for the table and the situation, it was important to win, but the performance was there tonight. We took a few risks in order to create danger for the opponents, matching them all the way to the end, and I believe we are on the right path now. All we can do is keep improving along these lines. I saw a team that fought hard for 95 minutes. I did not see a team that was struggling, afraid or let their heads drop. We do still make a lot of mistakes, such as passing when we should keep it, and vice versa, but I saw these players looking anxious and afraid when I arrived. I don’t see that in them now<br /><br /><b>[Pioli also made a point of mentioning Rafael Leao, who he felt failed to impact the contest off the bench]</b> I expected more from him tonight. When coming on, he was meant to give changes of pace, fresh energy, work with the team. He has a lot of potential, but he absolutely has to do more.

  <p><b>[Pioli targets Europe with Milan but knows sack threat lingers]</b> Today we are not in Europe, but even if we were, everything can change in 40 days. It would be a shame to finish the season in this position, we have to recover quickly. We don’t have an easy schedule but we have shown that we can compete with those ahead of us. We have shown that we have quality and sacrifice, tomorrow is a very important match. We are not the fourth-worst attack in the league because we haven’t created chances, but because we have one of the lowest conversion rates. We have to improve on this. There will be chances to make the difference, to score another goal will be even more important. We have to improve this data<br /><br /><b>[if Pioli is to get a second season, he knows Milan cannot afford to sleepwalk their way to the end of this campaign]</b> The future of all the coaches depends on these 40 days. Everyone can be talked about. We live on results. We have a great target to chase, our position in the table does not reflect our qualities and we have the chance to prove it</p>
