  <p><b>[Emotional Davide Astori tribute paid by Stefano Pioli]</b> The first thought goes to Davide, who I was fortunate enough to know over the last few months. He was special as both a person and a captain. He always found the right way and time to say things. He was generous, positive, altruistic. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to spend much time with him and I’ll miss him. I miss him every day I step on to that training ground. Our thoughts are with his family. I don’t know what to say to <b>[partner]</b> Francesca and <b>[daughter]</b> Vittoria, other than we will always be there for them<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the scenes at Astori’s funeral service, Pioli drew strength from the show of solidarity from the club’s supporters]</b> Our fans have a huge heart. I wanted to hug each and every one of them to console them and let them console us, so together we could find the strength to go on. We thank the whole football world, because such participation and solidarity is certainly down to Davide, but also means that there are still principles and values in a world that at times is described differently. Our club owners again showed their sensitivity and did everything possible to help the team. We are crying and suffering, because Davide was our reference point, but we know what to do in order to honour his memory. I usually like to motivate players by telling them: ‘Try to train and play as if it was the last time.’ I never needed to say that to Davide. He has left us so many values, that seed of passion, professionalism and sensitivity. Now it’s up to us to look after it and help that seed grow. All united, in memory of Davide</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> head coach Stefano Pioli believes his side are moving in the right direction despite suffering a sixth loss in just 11 <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> matches this season]</b> In my view, the team is improving. Of course, for the table and the situation, it was important to win, but the performance was there tonight. We took a few risks in order to create danger for the opponents, matching them all the way to the end, and I believe we are on the right path now. All we can do is keep improving along these lines. I saw a team that fought hard for 95 minutes. I did not see a team that was struggling, afraid or let their heads drop. We do still make a lot of mistakes, such as passing when we should keep it, and vice versa, but I saw these players looking anxious and afraid when I arrived. I don’t see that in them now<br /><br /><b>[Pioli also made a point of mentioning Rafael Leao, who he felt failed to impact the contest off the bench]</b> I expected more from him tonight. When coming on, he was meant to give changes of pace, fresh energy, work with the team. He has a lot of potential, but he absolutely has to do more. His contribution tonight was not up to his standards</p>

Matches start from 0-0, 11 players against 11. It’s a great challenge, but the big challenges also mean having a great opportunity. Talking about turning points is always difficult.

Clearly, this cannot be the real Milan, because we showed strong performances in other matches recently. We have to take some of the blame too, because we made mistakes and have to work. This cannot be us. Today’s performance makes it look as if it was our first game together, but that is not the case.

It’s a real pity, as we were in control and outplaying a strong team, making it look like there was never a 19-point gap between us. We had defensive duties and we did not perform them.
