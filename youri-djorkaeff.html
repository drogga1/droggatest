  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff show his love of living in Manhattan]</b> My dream project is to start a foundation in New York to raise money and provide scholarships to kids who can’t afford to play soccer here. I want to work with all the clubs in Manhattan and give between five and 10 scholarships a year. I hope it’s going to start next season<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about his son who studying in Manhattan]</b> He’s studying. He’s much brighter than his father<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>]</b> It’s good to have <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, it’s good to have <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>. But we need to think about how the kids can be better. We need to teach the 12-, 13-, 14-year-olds how to play faster and how to react faster. The problem in America is that you’re thinking when you receive the ball. You need to think before you receive the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff was destined for Ligue 1 say Jean ‘Tchouki’]</b> The whole family was immersed in football. I gave him the chance to really put himself to the test. Youri started out as a youngster with Decines <b>[in the suburbs of Lyon]</b>, and after that I got him a place with Saint-Priest, a feeder club for Olympique Lyonnais. When I saw he had what it takes to enjoy a career in this sport, I got right behind him.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco sensation Kylian Mbappe has been urged to use Manchester United’s Anthony Martial as an example of how difficult a big transfer can be to handle]</b> If I were the PSG president, I would sign him, but I wouldn’t be the only one in for him. He has tremendous potential, he must go to the club best suited for him. Look at Martial, when you go to a big club, you have to adapt and discover something else. Mbappe must pay attention to all of this.</p>

I’m from <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and I’ve followed Alexandre since he was young. He is the kind of striker who knows how to handle the game and is really good in the box.

  <p><b>[France World Cup winner Yuri Djorkaeff believes Kylian Mbappe has earned himself a place among the best in the world]</b> Today, there’s Mbappe and there are others. For me, he’s improved his play to draw alongside the very best. It’s up to him to continue like this. He’s given his services to the team, brought his style and made a difference that is outside the usual.<br /><br />When you see Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar, they’ve been practically obsolete in comparison to Mbappe. He’s made them old. I’m happy because that’s football. He’s got some way to go, but he will be the best player in the world. I’m impressed with his off-the-ball work, which he does to perfection</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s initial period of difficulty was inevitable]</b> Yes, I expected him to struggle, because I know <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> very well. I played over four years there, I know the squad and I know the club, and I knew that joining <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> was not an easy choice for <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a><br /><br />The recruitment was focused on young players, players to develop, so the results will come in one year, maybe two. And more importantly, he has 15 players injured that he won’t be able to field for three weeks or maybe a month<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff believes <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> will make a capable coach]</b> When he joined <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> he knew the problems, but he knows the club very well, it will take time and I think he has it in himself to be a coach. He loves coaching, he loves talking with his players. He’s having problems but I’m sure it’s going to get better, he won last weekend so he’ll be able to breathe a bit more, and step by step, he’ll climb back</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> needed a year to recover from winning the 2018 World Cup]</b> When you win a World Cup, the following year is usually difficult for everyone, not only <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. For any world champion, the impact is such that you need a year <b>[to get over it]</b>. Next year, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> should reach an even better level. He will be able to show his qualities better than he could with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in Manchester.<br /><br /><b>[Djorkaeff feels the challenge facing <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> will be to shape the Madrid squad in his image]</b> We were expecting him everywhere. He was linked to many clubs. What’s interesting is the way he came back. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are at the end of a cycle, got knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League and the following week the president <b>[Florentino Perez]</b> decided to change the head coach for someone who knows them well. That’s a strong message that the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president sent to the fans and the socios <b>[members]</b>. It says: ‘We’ll get the best back, even if he previously left, we’ll do whatever it takes to have him back and start the conquest again’.<br /><br />Don’t forget that they won three Champions Leagues in a row. It was a first. I think that the main change for <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is that he’s going to build a team. The first time, he joined an incredible team, with great players. He’s going to build a new team now that I hope will start a new cycle</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff says changes are needed at Paris Saint-Germain after the craziest end to the season]</b> Some changes must happen within the club. The main question in my opinion is to know who is at Paris Saint-Germain and what they’re doing there. I speak about players, entourage and staff. At some stage you need to put in place people who want to be there and help the club to improve. Once we’ll answer this question, many issues will be fixed.<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel’s place at the club has been questioned partly due to PSG’s below-par performance in the Champions League]</b> There is not much to think about because he’s the best in a league where they did not play many big games. Not to diminish Marseille, Lyon or Lille, the competition didn’t scare PSG. In Europe it didn’t go well. The end of the season is the craziest. It didn’t go according to plan at all. That a club like Paris let the team end the season that way is not allowed at such level.<br /><br />Paris Saint-Germain’s ambitions are to reach that level of the competition <b>[Champions League semi-finals]</b>. That’s why we are more concerned about what they lack than what they possess. It can be built. The Champions League is every year a learning experience. The issue that Paris Saint-Germain is facing is that at the same stage <b>[of the competition]</b>, they make the same mistakes. We then questioned ourselves about why Paris are not going through. I think that people in the club know why and that one day they’ll have to change their philosophy. The club’s identity must be <b>[to]</b> push more forward</p>
