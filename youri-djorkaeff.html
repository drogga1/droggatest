  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff show his love of living in Manhattan]</b> My dream project is to start a foundation in New York to raise money and provide scholarships to kids who can’t afford to play soccer here. I want to work with all the clubs in Manhattan and give between five and 10 scholarships a year. I hope it’s going to start next season<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about his son who studying in Manhattan]</b> He’s studying. He’s much brighter than his father<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about MLS]</b> It’s good to have <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, it’s good to have <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>. But we need to think about how the kids can be better. We need to teach the 12-, 13-, 14-year-olds how to play faster and how to react faster. The problem in America is that you’re thinking when you receive the ball. You need to think before you receive the ball</p>

I’m from <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and I’ve followed Alexandre since he was young. He is the kind of striker who knows how to handle the game and is really good in the box. He’s scoring goals every year and he is young<br /><br />The move will give him more credibility for the national team and in international games. I’m very happy for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. He made a very good move to sign Lacazette</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Djorkaeff talks about <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s initial period of difficulty was inevitable]</b> Yes, I expected him to struggle, because I know Monaco very well. I played over four years there, I know the squad and I know the club, and I knew that joining Monaco was not an easy choice for <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a><br /><br />The recruitment was focused on young players, players to develop, so the results will come in one year, maybe two. And more importantly, he has 15 players injured that he won’t be able to field for three weeks or maybe a month<br /><br /><b>[Youri Djorkaeff believes <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> will make a capable coach]</b> When he joined Monaco he knew the problems, but he knows the club very well, it will take time and I think he has it in himself to be a coach. He loves coaching, he loves talking with his players. He’s having problems but I’m sure it’s going to get better, he won last weekend so he’ll be able to breathe a bit more, and step by step, he’ll climb back</p>
