  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Israeli international Yossi Benayoun comments on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> (1) - (0) Real Madrid]</b> You can score a very famous goal, an absolutely crucial one, and it will all be forgotten the following day, as far as the manager is concerned. For me,it will only be important if we go all the way and win the Champions League. Otherwise, it will count for nothing</p>

  <p><b>[Yossi Benayoun has credited <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> for reviving the glory days at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’m happy to see it, it’s amazing to see where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are at the moment. From what I see, they play amazing football. The most special thing is you feel they are a team - everyone knows what they’re doing on the pitch, you don’t have one or two big stars and everything is on them. The star of the team is the team itself, one unit. They play together. And the commitment the players have is something special. I don’t see any other team in Europe that has this commitment from the goalkeeper to the striker to work together, to press. When they decide to press they press everyone, no-one can play against them. It’s amazing. Of course, big credit to the manager, to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. I think this is the big difference from years before. I really enjoy watching them. Hopefully, they will continue like this and make us proud</p>
