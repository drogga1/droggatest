  <p><b>[Franck Kessie has named Manchester United as the club he would like to play for most]</b> I did not hear any rumours around Roma, as I was at the Africa Cup of Nations and so focused only on playing. I like the Premier League and in particular Manchester United, the club I dream of playing for. Chelsea? That is also a big club, nobody would turn them down, but I dream of United.</p>

  <p><b>[Franck Kessie well aware that he has much to work on]</b> The only thing that interests me at the moment is learning as much as possible from Gian Piero Gasperini. I must improve tactically. I came to Italy for this reason. I think that this is the best league in the world from a tactical point of view. Here, a young guy learns more about the game, especially from a defensive perspective<br /><br />I like the Premier League and, in particular, Manchester United, the club I dream of playing for.
