  <p><b>[Bournemouth are looking at potential sites for a new ground after confirming their intention to leave the Vitality Stadium on Friday]</b> Earlier this year, the club submitted an application to redevelop the South Stand, which is due to go before planners later this month for approval. It has always been the board of directors’ preferred option to buy the stadium back from Structadene and develop a Premier League-standard stadium on the current site at Kings Park.<br /><br />However, following discussions over a number of months with both Structadene and Bournemouth Borough Council’s planning department, it has become apparent that this will not be possible. Firstly, we are not going to develop a stadium we do not own and will not be held to ransom over a price to purchase the existing site.<br /><br />And secondly, the council’s planning department have made it clear that they would not welcome a significantly bigger stadium in Kings Park, meaning we are severely constricted in what we can achieve on this site with regards to size, capacity and facilities. Therefore, we feel we have no other option but to find a new site and are working closely with Bournemouth Borough Council to identify a suitable location</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth have signed England Under-21 international Lloyd Kelly from Bristol City for a reported £13 million ($17m) fee]</b> I’m delighted to complete the transfer of Lloyd. Over the last few years we have secured some of the brightest homegrown, young players in the game and believe we have done so again with Lloyd. There was interest in him from a number of other clubs so it was important to make a move early, and under the tutelage of Eddie Howe I believe Lloyd will be an excellent addition to the squad</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> defender <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> has also been linked with a move away, but chief executive Neill Blake is determined to retain <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>’s stars]</b> Throughout his time at the club Callum has demonstrated incredible determination to succeed at the highest level - even in the face of adversity in the form of two season-ending injuries. He has proved himself as a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> striker and is now beginning to establish himself at international level, and this contract is just reward for that. We have no desire to lose our best players and this is further evidence of the board’s commitment to keep <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> progressing year on year</p>
