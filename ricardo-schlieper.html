<blockquote>
  <p>[Nicolas Tagliafico has rejected a contract extension from Ajax] The Champions League has given Nicolas a profile which has caught the attention of many teams. He is on the list of big clubs who can pay what Ajax want. Now he is a coveted footballer and it will depend on negotiations. We haven’t talked numbers with Ajax, but they are going to ask for a big sum. I think it will be more than €20 million (£17m/$22m). Ajax made an offer to match what the teams who want Nicolas could pay, but he didn’t accept because it is the right time to take the leap. We’ll see what happens in the window.<br /><br />Nico has a great virtue which is his professionalism, his discipline. This, sooner or later, takes you to the place you want to be. He has been in Ajax for a year and a half. He is feeling good because it is also a good time for the team</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Sead Kolasinac has brushed off speculation linking Arsenal with a summer move for a new left-back] He [Tagliafico] believes that the time has come to try a new experience in a different league. He wants to keep improving and I already turned down a significant contract extension. There are several teams that made enquiries for him, but it’s too soon to say where he will play next season. Ajax want a significant amount of money for him, and that will definitely scare some clubs off</p>
