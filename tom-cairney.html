  <p><b>[Fulham midfielder Tom Cairney has hailed the impact Chelsea loanees Tomas Kalas and Lucas Piazon]</b> I just think they have made the squad so strong. Kalas has been brilliant, especially at the start of the season. Lucas has just got a bad injury at the weekend but he is brilliant on the ball and has done well. We pass out from the back. It is risky football, if you make an error, don’t worry. You just have to keep on going and I think that’s why as games have gotten on we have got more and more confident and we are showing that at the minute<br /><br />I think it is great <b>[to win London’s EFL Player of the Year]</b>. It is great for me and my family and it is a proud moment. My form this season has been the best of my career so far, no doubt. The manager and the staff have played me in more of a central position and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I just think it is the change of position, change of formation, it just suits my game. I’m on the ball a hell of a lot, and I don’t know, maybe giving me the captaincy gave me a bit of extra responsibility in the roll. I owe a lot to <b>[manager]</b>.<br /><br />I don’t know about taking over from him, he’s a legend <b>[Scott Parker]</b>. I am the captain when Scott doesn’t play. In terms of football we are playing some of the best stuff in the Championship with the passing game that we have. The results haven’t matched our performances sometimes and we have got to change that if we are to have a chance of getting into the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are set to complete the signing of teenage forward <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> from Fulham]</b> He’s been a sensation since he joined in training a few months ago. He doesn’t look out of place and does some bits of magic that everyone says ‘wow’. His attitude and his belief in himself at such a young age is frightening. He’s got a great football brain, an eye for goal and is a very entertaining player</p>
