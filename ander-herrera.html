  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of former Manchester United and Spain midfielder Ander Herrera]</b> Paris Saint-Germain is the greatest club in France. It keeps on improving and competes to win every possible title. I was looking forward to coming to Paris and to wearing those colors. I hope to continue to make history with the club! Joining this club is an amazing feeling. I also love the city. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. I promise three things: work, professionalism and passion. I also promise to improve my French because I think that the language is very important for the team’s communication</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera claims the Manchester United board failed to convince him of his ‘importance within the squad’ amid contract talks, which led to his free transfer to Paris Saint Germain]</b> I don’t like looking at the past but there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it. I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club for, the fans and also Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things didn’t happen. They arrived late and, by then, I’d already made the decision to play in Paris<br /><br /><b>[Looking back on his time at Old Trafford, Herrera admitted winning the award was among his proudest moments]</b> It has been fantastic. In five years I have played 189 games and I have been important for all the coaches. It is true that that the MVP (Sir Matt Busby Award) makes one feel special and very happy, I keep every moment that I have lived. Why PSG? Because to leave United, the biggest team in England, you need something like PSG, which is the biggest in France. I could not play in another English club</p>

We were a completely different team than we had been before because, to be honest, we were physically f*cked. We couldn’t run any more.

I remember watching him because <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were our rivals for titles and the top four. I saw them losing games 2-0 and Alexis would score two and they’d win the game. He’d score the winning goal. It shows football sometimes has no explanation. How can a player, who one month before, two months before, is the best player by far in a big team like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> … then he comes to United and he doesn’t perform? I have no explanation.<br /><br /><b>[Herrera added on Sanchez’s failure to transfer his performances in training to matchdays at Old Trafford]</b> He trains good, he is a good professional, he tries to improve. In training sessions, you can see his quality. He scores a lot of goals. In front of the goalkeeper in training, he was lethal, scoring goals, goals, goals. He fights if he loses the ball, he runs back and wins the ball, so he had everything to succeed at United, and he didn’t do it. The only thing I can tell you is that I have no explanation</p>

  <p><b>[Herrera reveals behind the scenes confusion that led to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> departure]</b> It was not about money. It was not about the duration of the contract offer. In my opinion, I waited too long (for an offer) and deserved more attention from the club. I was a player that gave everything. I never complained. I never went to the media to complain about anything. I never put a bad face to any manager, to any member of the board, and they waited until I had five or six months left on my contract. That’s why I had some disagreements with them. I tell you this but I also tell you that it is part of football, part of life, nothing personal at all - but you ask the question and I give my point of view, as a professional player<br /><br /><b>[Herrera’s first season at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> has been disrupted by injuries]</b> In my opinion, France cancelled the league prematurely because it is showing that they can come back. You see your team-mates working and you are envious</p>

  <p><b>[PSG team-mate Herrera says Atletico Madrid-linked <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> ‘wants to play in Spain’]</b> I know <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> wants to play in Spain. He loves the league and the country, he asks me about it a lot. However, since we left Paris I’ve not spoken to him about his situation. <br /><br /><b>[Herrera went on to express his delight over <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>’s new four year-contract at PSG]</b> This is great news for the club, which ensures a top-3 striker for the next six or seven years, as it is still very young. He <b>[Icardi]</b> has scored goals, he adapted very quickly and inside the area he is a beast and outside of it, very practical and intelligent, because he knows what his virtues and limitations are</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba’s former team-mate Ander Herrera believes the Frenchman has the ability, but needs the consistency to be considered world-class]</b> I don’t know what other players say but he is a midfielder that has everything. If you see other midfielders in the world, they may have some qualities - control of the ball, long shots, passes, tackles, box-to-box - but Paul can do all of this, plus head the ball, score goals, make recoveries, one against one … everything. But of course, if you want to become the best midfielder in the world, it is about consistency. You have to do it day in, day out. He is a good guy. He wants to do it. He does train well. He has to do it every day</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez’s shocking decline: From <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> superstar to Inter reject]</b> Sometimes, in football, there is no explanation for every single thing that happens.
