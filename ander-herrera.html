  <p><b>[Ander Herrera considers Manchester United to be the best club in England]</b> I just want to win games for Manchester United. I don’t care about other teams. I play for the best. I am very, very happy with the way United fans show their affection to me. To be honest, I don’t care about the rest of the teams. No, I just play for United and I’m very thankful to the fans. I am very lucky that I play for the best club in England so I don’t really think about the rest of the teams.<br /><br /><b>[Herrera has been a regular under Jose Mourinho]</b> I know what he wants from me. We have a clear relationship. I know what he expects from me and I will always try my best. I can make mistakes, as can any player, but the most important thing for me is the achievements of the club and the team. I think everyone knows in the club that I try to always give everything. Sometimes more successfully than other times but I try my best, always. The manager has helped me a lot to find that position and to improve in that position. I am a team player. If I have to play in other midfield roles, I would be very happy. If I was at right-back, I would be happy as well. When you want to have a great season, there is no space for your own ‘likes’. I think you have the chance to help the team wherever the manager wants to play you. He will have no problem with me if I have to play wherever in the team</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera has hailed the aura which surrounds Manchester United and allows them to win games that they have little right to prevail in]</b> Southampton played very well but we have been looking for this the whole season. How many times have we played better than our opponents and had much more chances than our opponents, but didn’t win? I said that sooner or later, the goals will come and I think we were very, very clinical on Sunday. Sometimes, the badge wins games and this was an example of that.<br /><br />It’s a very nice feeling. Our second trophy of the season, my third with the club and all that’s happened to me in this stadium <b>[Wembley]</b> has been brilliant. Our fans have another trophy for our brilliant history so everything is good. I think one of the things <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho has brought to this club is he is a winner. He shared that with the group, with the team and with the squad. At this moment, it’s not very easy to beat us. We have to respect every opponent but the badge sometimes wins the game. We keep going. It’s our second title of the season but it’s not enough for us. We are not having too much time to enjoy it with our people. We are playing every week now but have two days off as the manager understands perfectly what we need. Already, we have to focus on Bournemouth <b>[Saturday’s visitors to Old Trafford]</b> as we have to be in the top four. We want to play in the Champions League next season</p>

  <p><b>[In-form Jesse Lingard has been doing incredible things for Manchester United]</b> His goal was amazing. It was incredible. I have already said it but he never gives up. His movement is good and he shoots very well with both feet and when you keep trying and are optimistic with yourself, and you try and try and try, sooner or later you get the result and the result was another fantastic goal. His movement is also important. He’s very quick as well and no-one can touch him. He wants to improve and become a better player and you can see that in every training session. He’s showing that in games too. He is in fantastic form and can get better.<br /><br /><b>[On Romelu Lukaku]</b> Romelu played very well. He held the ball up well and gave us a target in the second half. The second goal by him was incredible and also the assist from Anthony was very good. But we cannot just single out two or three names because the whole team played amazing. I felt really good on the pitch, having the ball, moving the ball, receiving the ball, turning, shooting, crossing. I think we did almost everything well, although you always have things to improve. For me, we played one of our best games of the season, full of control, good play, good movement of the ball. Everyone was feeling good on the pitch, participating well in the game. That’s why after 80 minutes I could not believe that we were not winning. After that, football was fair with us and we scored two but it could have been six or seven</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera would happily concede the Premier League title to Manchester City in exchange for Champions League glory at Manchester United]</b> I don’t think about City, just about us. To win the Champions League would be enormous for us. Massive. So if you said City win the title and we win the Champions League this time, I would sign that document right now. People forget that it’s still possible for us to win two big titles this season - the Champions League and FA Cup. We are still in the race for both. It could be an adventure to do it.<br /><br />The Champions League is a big, big title and to win it would be special. But we are only concerned at the minute about getting past Sevilla because it is not easy. They are a tough team and we still have to work hard to go through. But we know there is a lot more to fight for this season<br /><br />Yes, City is in a very good place and only a miracle will give us a chance - but you don’t stop. The dream of Manchester United is to be the top team and win the title but to do it we are going to have to make up a lot of points. You don’t give up but second position is there and confirms you will be in the Champions League. So you have to keep going. We want to finish as high as possible but you can’t forget there are maybe five clubs going for second place. We are reaching an important time in the season, the key moment, and the team needs total concentration on the pitch to achieve our goals</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera reveals key role Carrick &amp; Young played in Manchester derby turnaround]</b> This is one of the best, one of the most emotional games so far in my career with Manchester United. We didn’t talk too much about tactics at half-time. We just talked about our pride, about the club, and how you can never underestimate United. We knew that our fans were going to have a difficult night if we lost. So we did it for them and of course for us and our position, but overall for them. It was an important game for our fans. I was feeling sorry for them because it was going to be a difficult day for all of them. But this is Manchester United and nobody should ever underestimate it. Everyone was talking at half-time. Of course, the oldest guys with the most experience - Ash <b>[Young]</b> and Michael <b>[Carrick]</b>, who was also in the dressing room - they have power in their words but everyone was talking. It was very important for our position in the league. We want to finish second and build a stronger Manchester United for next season. That’s all. Normally we should be fighting for the title with this amount of points. We want to finish as well as we possibly can this season. All the people in the newspapers, the journalists, have been talking about what this result means for the rivalry, the derby, our opponents. But we just think about Manchester United. That’s it, we don’t think about the others.</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera sees improvement at Manchester United]</b> In any other year we would have competed for the Premier League, but we cannot take anything away from what City have done. I do not remember a better team since Wenger’s Arsenal of the 2003-04 season, which did not lose any matches. If next season we are able to match or improve our record, we will be in the fight.<br /><br />The data is there. It is true that last year we won three titles, but we finished sixth in the Premier League and we had to win the Europa League to qualify for the Champions League. You have to put everything in perspective. In England, the Premier League is given more importance than the Champions League and we are up on the previous season. We have done a good job but have found ourselves up against an impeccable opponent<br /><br />United’s history is winning titles, not winning a derby. We have made that clear, but preventing a rival from winning the Premier League has important meaning. During the game I thought about those 4,000 fans who were at the Etihad and were going to suffer a setback that would have remained throughout history had we lost. No-one should underestimate us. There was no specific talk, just random comments and a collective reaction. We appealed to our pride and everyone tried to correct their mistakes to avoid City becoming champions</p>

We have started talking but nothing has been decided yet. Obviously you are happier when you play, but it also comforts me to be physically well, to train to the fullest and go home with the assurance of having given the maximum.<br /><br /><b>[Sergio]</b> Busquets is the great reference in that position and Matic is also among the best. What I like is to give the coach options. Mourinho backs you up if you give it your all. Whether you play or not, this is a group and the group is most important<br /><br />I have never been close to them before. You may have sometimes thought of me as one of the 15 alternatives on your list, but I can say that I have never been close to signing</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera has hailed the cat-like qualities of Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea]</b> David has something special. He was born with a gift. There are times in training when I shoot and in my head I’m saying ‘Gol!’ like the Spanish commentators, then this cat-like hand emerges from nowhere and claws it away. I shake my head, laugh and enjoy him. He’s made saves in games where I’ve stopped in my tracks and just said to myself: ‘How good is this guy?’ He will make a save and everyone’s singing his name, the TV’s showing six replays, Twitter’s going mad, and he gets up as if it is the easiest thing in the world. Before games, I’m a bit crazy. I get tense, I shake, dance. David pats me on the back, shrugs and says: ‘No, Ander, stand still, don’t worry, it can’t go wrong. If they shoot, they cannot score because I’m in goal’. It’s like nothing has happened. In the FA Cup semi-final against Everton in 2016, he saved a penalty from Romelu Lukaku and after the game he’s just like: ‘OK, that happened. What do you want to do tomorrow?’ It’s like a student handing in an assignment and moving on. This is greatness</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera has put Manchester United team-mate David de Gea in the same bracket as Lionel Messi]</b> For me, David is the best by far. I think he has something that comes from God - God chose him in the goal and chose Messi on the pitch. You cannot train what he did against Liverpool. You cannot train what he did against Kun Aguero when he was two metres in front of him and he put his hand out. He’s really good - you can see when he receives the ball he knows always what to do. He has some special abilities that I think he hasn’t trained them, because you cannot train them, you just have them</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera says he expects to remain at Manchester United beyond this season]</b> My future is the FA Cup final. I want to be here next season and unless the club sack me, I will be here in pre-season and fight to keep adding games to my total. In football, what today is black is white tomorrow. So if you think about what can happen in the summer, maybe the club signs four midfielders and they don’t want me any more. The only thing I can do is train well today and train well tomorrow. That’s all I can say - and of course if the club wants to talk to me <b>[to extend my contract, which runs out in June 2019]</b> I will listen to them because I am happy here.<br /><br />I don’t think if you don’t take your chance it’s the last chance you have in the season. I don’t go crazy when I don’t have my best game and say: ‘Oof, I’ve lost my chance, I’m not going to play again’. I know some of my team-mates, and some footballers, are up and down. If I play well I’m not very happy and if I play badly I’m not very sad. My age and experience has helped me keep that balance. If you work hard and respect the ones who are playing at that moment but try to give everything you have, whether that’s five minutes or 30 minutes, sooner or later football is fair. I really believe that</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera believes that Premier League champions Manchester City will not be able to replicate the devastating form the showed this term for another year]</b> I think this season was an exception. I don’t think the Premier League is going to be like it was this season. Next season I think the champion can be champion with 85, 86 points. I think this season was an exception. City won six or seven games in the last minutes. I remember West Ham at home, Huddersfield away, Southampton, Bournemouth. If they draw all those games, maybe the champions would be seven or eight points less. I don’t think next season the champions will be again that far from the second.<br /><br />If any player in the world tells you he doesn’t care about what the opponents do he is lying to you. I cannot lie to you - if I could choose at the beginning of the season who wins the Premier League and who wins the Champions League, if we couldn’t be champions, I wouldn’t tell you Manchester City and Liverpool. I respect them - I have never hated anyone - but I cannot lie</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera believes he is at the best team in the UK]</b> I’m happy in the club and I love the fans. I’m playing for the best team in the UK, so my first intention is to stay because I love what I do and I love where I am.<br /><br />We have to be at least as good as we were last season in the league, but try to make less mistakes. I mean games like Huddersfield away, West Brom at home - I have respect for those teams, but we should have won. Some league games, they’re fights and they’re wars. We have to be ready for it. We were for most of the games, but we made a couple of mistakes that we need to fix. After the game with Huddersfield I said they were more ready and more aggressive than us, so the only thing we can do for these games is be ready, because it’s going to be a fight. The only thing that we can blame ourselves about last season was the Champions League, because we should have beaten Sevilla. But in the other competitions we were in the FA Cup final against Chelsea and deserved to win, and we had an amount of points in the league that normally you’re fighting for the title</p>

He can be one of the best players in the world and I think he is very focused this season to smash it. When you have players like Anthony, like Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Alexis Sanchez, those kind of players that can change the game.<br /><br />If one of them cannot play, we have three or four more so we have lots of options. I think we shouldn’t think that any other club in the Premier League has better players because at least we have as good as the opponents. Now it’s all about work, confidence, about keep playing like he did <b>[in the friendly against CF America]</b>. I am confident with them because they are all amazing players and Anthony looks very sharp</p>

  <p><b>[Ander Herrera believes Jose Mourinho is right to complain about Manchester United’s pre-season preparations]</b> It’s true, and I agree with him. It must be difficult for him to work with a group of players, maybe 50 per cent of whom he’s not going to have in the future. You can’t really work tactically, because the guys you’re working with could be leaving, going on loan or going to the second team, so it’s difficult for him. It’s also difficult for us, but we knew in advance before coming that it was going to be like this. This is my fifth pre-season here and it’s the most strange pre-season so far.<br /><br />I can just say that with us he’s very positive, he wants us to fight for the titles, he wants us to perform to our best, he wants us to work as hard as possible. But probably he’s not frustrated about the club or the market, he’s probably frustrated because he’s not able to work with the players that he’s going to have for the season. Also you have the situation with Matteo Darmian, he’s playing now every game but probably he’s going to leave. And then some kids, they’re probably going on loan. So I can understand the manager and if I put myself in his position, I would be in the same situation. You want to fight for the titles but you don’t have the team with you to work for it right now<br /><br />I think the most intelligent thing would have been to postpone the start of the season by maybe one week. But we have to accept what’s coming and luckily we’re going to have some players that are now on holiday. We’re going to have them back one week before the start of the season so they can also help. I think we’re suffering the most, because we had the most players in the semi-finals and final of the World Cup. But this is football and sometimes it’s like this. It’s really difficult for the manager to now prepare the team because he likes to work tactically and he’s not able to do it. The only thing we can do now is be positive and try to be as fit as possible for the start of the season. The work we’re not able to do now, we’ll do it in the last three or four days before the start of the season. We’re in this situation because we have so many good players - fantastic players who have reached the <b>[World Cup]</b> semi-finals and the final</p>

We did a good 60 or 70 minutes and should have been winning 2-0 at half-time, but we didn’t. If we want to win the next game against Burnley this is the commitment we should have. This is the way we have to play. We have quality, a very big squad. We made six changes and for the first 70 minutes, we were good. It’s easy to turn things around.<br /><br />It’s easy to understand what happened. When you have 16 or 17 attempts, when you have so many opportunities to score in the first 60 or 70 minutes and you don’t do it, the opponent can score. The opponent can hurt you. They did it - they scored from their first corner - and what can we say? We made them feel uncomfortable on the pitch, we had so many crosses, lateral free-kicks, corners. They were really uncomfortable in the game and at half-time, it was incredible we were not winning the game. I think the commitment, the approach, the attitude, the way we faced the game was perfect. We didn’t let them build - one of the things they do well is building up and we didn’t let them do it. The only thing we can do is look to the future and the next game. If we approach the game against Burnley the same way, with the same attitude and winning mentality, normally we should win the game. So, we can take good things <b>[from Spurs]</b> for the next game</p>

It’ll be a good game to play<br /><br />Nowadays <b>[with Juve]</b> it’s not only about the defence, I think they are very strong also in attack. They are a very balanced team, very experienced and they have great players, and they have done really well in the last few years.

We know at the moment there are some fantastic wingers in modern football: Ousmane Dembele, Raheem Sterling, Anthony Martial, Eden Hazard… but Marcus is different. Marcus can shoot, he can play one-against-one, but he also has the quality to combine and not lose the ball for the team. I couldn’t name another player that reminds me of Marcus Rashford. I think he’s already a top, top, top player, but I think he will improve with time in his decision making and he will be unstoppable.<br /><br />We all know Lingard doesn’t have the one-on-one ability that Rashford or Martial or Alexis Sanchez have, but he has other qualities that are very important. When I receive the ball, as soon as I turn, I know Jesse is moving to receive the ball. Juan Mata is quite similar, they’re always ready to get the ball and help the team. Football is about making the right decisions. That’s why Mata is still playing and playing fantastically. I always say to him that he’s not the quickest, he’s not the strongest, he doesn’t have the best shot, but he always makes the right decision. When you see one of us shooting on goal, who is the one that is always ready for the rebound from the goalkeeper? Mata. When you see one of our full-backs crossing the ball, who is always in the right position in the pitch in the box? Mata.
