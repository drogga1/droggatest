  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b> For me he can play many more times. He is still at a top level. He has been playing very well since I arrived at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He can continue for sure. His performances have been consistent. Since I have been at the club, I haven’t seen him play badly. That’s the truth. He was always helping everybody. He has been a massive support to me. When I started my first games last year he was always talking to me. He is a legend and a very good leader. I have learnt a lot from him</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma is expecting to remain at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> after being given assurances over his future]</b> I’m happy with what the manager said about me. That means he is seeing the work I’m doing and I’m very pleased with that. We had a chat, and he was very good with me. He is a very good manager. I enjoyed my time at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> but I’m a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player and we’ll see what will happen now in the future. I think it will be here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. This is a chance for me. I went out on loan last season but I’m a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player and I want to do well to get my chance and be here<br /><br /><b>[On his spell at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, which delivered 36 appearances and two goals]</b> It was a very good season for me. It was very good for my development. After my injury I was ready to play week-in week-out. Going there I did that and improved myself technically and tactically in every aspect with the manager there. I am a better player. Everything has improved in my game. I still have a lot to learn and to work on but I feel I have done a lot<br /><br /><b>[Zouma is, however, aware that he faces fierce competition for places at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, with the likes of <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>, <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Antonio Rudiger</a> and <a href="andreas-christensen.html">Andreas Christensen</a> also hoping to secure centre-half berths]</b> There is a lot of quality here. It depends on the manager. He can only play with two centre-backs. He has to make the choice but he is lucky because he has good players. It will be hard for him to make that choice but that is what we’re here for<br /><br /><b>[Zouma is determined to find regular football due to a desire on his part to add to the collection of five senior caps he has earned for his country]</b> That is very important for me. It was one of my targets to get into the France team. I had been there before and wanted to come back. I managed to do that. Now the target is to play at the Euros - but to be there you have to be playing at your club. So I am working very hard - and let’s see what is going to happen</p>

Kurt Zouma, is a target for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> following an impressive loan spell at Goodison Park last season, but <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is keen to keep the France international following the release of <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma says new <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> taught him to hate losing]</b> It was <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> who opened the gates of England to me. I was only 19 when I arrived there. I was young. He also gave me confidence by making me play big games with a lot of intensity. He was the one who showed me what football was like in England. The coach is a man who hates losing. He taught me to hate defeat. Thanks to him, I was able to flourish at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He gave me a lot of things and taught me a lot. I thank him<br /><br />He is a coach who is really close to us. It’s clear that he was still a player until recently. He talks to us a lot, participates a lot in training. When we work defensively on corners, he’s the one who takes them. You should see the precision he has. It’s amazing. He has so many qualities with his feet. He also does the rondo with us. I can assure you that he almost never goes in the middle. He is still very strong.</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> hates defeat]</b> He hates a defeat, he hates it. He’s the kind of manager who comes to us when we make a mistake and tells us but he’s very calm as well. He understands the game because he’s been involved in it for a long time and he’s there to give us advice. He’s the first one to say when we make a mistake and we try to make it right in the next game<br /><br /><b>[Zouma admits marked improvement is required]</b> We were frustrated with the defeat of course. I think that’s a message for us to answer. We have to play with personality and show character because we lost at the weekend. It’s clear he wants to motivate us and we’re already motivated for this game. He wants us to be more responsible in the games and take more risks. He knows the quality that we have in the squad with very talented players. We have to play the game like we play in training, be good, take risks and play without fear. We’ve maybe had a lack of communication in the games sometimes but we have a very good team so we can bounce back. We won seven games in a row not long ago. We need to be more clinical as well and stay as a team<br /><br /><b>[The Blues’ cause has been aided by the return to fitness of German centre-half <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Antonio Rudiger</a>]</b> <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a> is an important player for us. He’s a very experienced player and we know the qualities he has. It’s good to have him back, he has no pain and he’s feeling good so he can help us in the games like every player in the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>]</b> It is difficult to defend against him because he has the physique of a big centre forward, a ‘target man’ as we say here in English football. But on top of that, he is technical and quick like a small player. Few players have both of those qualities, so the defenders are not used to that. You are pushed around, and as well, you get out-dribbled with finesse</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Kurt Zouma says manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> deserves all the credit for his tactical decisions in the win against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and possesses the players to operate in different systems]</b> The manager just wants us to show personality on the pitch, with the ball and without the ball as well. He just wants us to talk together a lot and also when we get the ball just play and that means taking risks at times. Not crazy risks but being in position and try to do a bit more sometimes to help the team and to get the win. We hadn’t been playing three at the back for a long time now, maybe one or two months, and coming back to that and playing like that, for sure the manager deserves the credit because he did it well and everybody respected the plan. We can change formations depending on the opponent and depending on the players that we have. We have all different kinds of players and playing four at the back or three at the back, for us both of them are good formations. We have very talented players who can play in different positions no problem<br /><br />Boxing Day is not special because every three days we have a game, and we know that after Christmas people will be celebrating a little bit maybe with their families but it is an important game for us. Especially at home we want to win this one and especially we want to confirm the victory we had at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, so we want to keep going and get another streak of wins. We have to play the same as we did against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. It does not matter who the opponent is. Just fight for every ball, be as a team, be compact and defend well, and try to score the chances we get. That is it</p>

  <p><b>[Zouma: <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> told me I was rubbish at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I cannot remember which match we were playing, we were losing 3-1, away from home. The following day, he <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> catches up with me, he takes me to his office, and he asks me if I am ok. I said yes, he asked me if I was sure. I said yes again, he replied ‘Because you were rubbish this weekend.’ Like that, direct. It shocked me, but it made me want to immediately respond on the pitch. I remember that it hurt me, that it affected me. But I really wanted to show him that I could react<br /><br />He is someone who loves victory. He uses all the tools possible to achieve it. I came here at 19 and he played me. I was able to have my chances, I played my matches. I don’t know what other people think, we all have different opinions, but from my side, I don’t really agree <b>[with the notion that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> does not give young players a chance]</b></p>

We know they have great players up front, they have a great team, and we did very well defensively and it is not just about defenders, all of us as a team played very well defensively, and offensively.
