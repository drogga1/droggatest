  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma hopes his strong Chelsea form can continue over the second half of the season in order to boost his chances of playing for France at Euro 2016]</b> It is a big year for me personally. There are the Euros in France and of course I want to be there in the squad so I have to keep working hard with Chelsea, improving myself in training and playing games. The tournament is at home in France, we want to win and be a very strong team, just like we do with Chelsea. There are many more matches to win in 2016 and the new year has started well - let’s keep it up<br /><br />I am very proud to be at Chelsea, one of the biggest clubs in the world. I am very happy and feel I have improved a lot. In 2015 I had a lot of chances to play, played in some big games and won two titles, so I am happy with the year on a personal level</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma is itching to see regular competitive football at Chelsea again]</b> Watching the team doing well makes me happy, even if that means I am not playing. The team is doing well and we have got some good momentum. Of course, I want to play but I want them to keep going. You just have to wait for your time and be ready when it comes. My chance will come again, for sure. I do not worry about that. JT is the captain, a legend of the club, and even he is on the bench. But we are a team. Is it difficult? Yes, because I want to play. But no, because we are doing so well at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma admits there will be discussions regarding his Chelsea future once the 2016-17 campaign comes to a close]</b> We’ll have to see how the second half of the season goes. The team is the priority: first of all, to be champions! After that, yes, we’ll have to talk, because I’m young, and it’s at my age that you have to play the most. For the moment, I’m waiting, I’m happy the team is winning, even if at a moment in time, I’m going to have to play if I want to achieve my objectives and get back into the France team. There will be discussions, but once again, I’m not worried about all that. For the moment, it’s the team that counts.<br /><br />It’s certain that I would get back to my best more quickly by playing, but I’m learning a lot. I know that, tactically, I had some weaknesses, and I have worked a lot to put those right, with the coach, in matches and in training. I’m not worried about my level. I’m a rather confident guy, and I know that I’ll get <b>[my best form]</b> back sooner or later</p>

I think more to the present, with the squad, which is very good and which is going well. We want to do great things.<br /><br />A loan before the World Cup? Why not. We’ll see at the end of the season, but I’m focusing on Chelsea. I’m confident and I know I will play. I’ve not talked about my future with Antonio Conte</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma was laughing and smiling as he recalled his pathway into football that has led to him becoming a key player at Chelsea]</b> I remember when I started <b>[at a club]</b> when I was nine years old. Before that, I was playing down the street, with my brother and my friends. Before, I didn’t want to be a footballer, I just wanted to play for fun. I wanted to be a basketballer. I loved basketball. I played basketball a lot but then, and I don’t know why, my brother said, ‘Let’s go to the club next to our house. Let’s try and we can be, or I can be a footballer’. Then I said, ‘Why not?’ I remember when I started I was in the second team, not the first one.<br /><br />I was with the players who come but they are not so good. When I started I played one game for them and then I went straight into the first team. I started believing that football can be a good thing. I was playing as a right winger and as a striker as well. Then when the game was difficult, because I was strong and quick, the manager used me as a defender and then I stayed at the back. I used to score a lot of goals because I was quick and strong. So just run and shoot, that’s it. I remember when I was in Vaulx-En-Velin, I had some trials for St. Etienne. Then I knew that I was going to sign there. They gave me a contract, they said, ‘Do you want to sign?’ and I said yes. When I was young, at first, I wanted to sign for Lyon, but it didn’t happen. I went to St. Etienne because it was not far from where I used to live. Then I stayed there, I did my job for two or three years. I was with the U17s and the U19s and then with the reserves for the first team. Then, when I was 16, I signed my first contract. I came to St. Etienne with my mother<br /><br />For me also, it was like I was dreaming, I was so happy that I signed my contract, I was so proud of that. I was 16, I worked hard for that. <b>[My parents cried]</b> because I was so young. I told them when I was young, ‘I want to be a professional for you because you deserve it’. When they saw me with the contract, they were so happy for me. I made a promise when I was 12 or 13, ‘I will sign my first contract, don’t worry.’ That’s why I was so happy. I was always confident, I talked with my parents and it was just instinct. I said, ‘I will be a professional, don’t worry’ and I did it. That’s why they were so happy for me<br /><br /><b>[The Chelsea loanee counts playing football with his brothers as a big influence on getting him to where he is today]</b> I have got five brothers and one younger sister. They play football. Lionel is playing in Greece. My sister is young and she still goes to school, my other ones play but in a lower level. One plays for Angers in France. He’s in the reserve team at the moment so <b>[we are]</b> quite a sporty family. When we were young we always used to play football, always do something, always played basketball. I always wanted to win - it was a competition between each other, so it was good. Lionel made me get into football. He’s 24 years old. He was playing at Sochaux in France, I remember the time we were playing against each other in a professional game. My father, my mother and everybody came to the game. It was very, very strange playing against your brother. At a corner, he would mark me and I used to mark him at the corner. It was crazy, but a nice feeling. My brother is like my twin, just one year difference. Same height, same weight, same face or similar. Similar, he is like my twin. I just spoke to him this morning. I have always got him on the phone and I am talking to him. I have got my family and he has got his kid. Before every game, he calls me. Before the games he plays, I call him. All the time he gives advice. He watches my games. ‘That was good, that could be better, you could do that.’ So it is very, very nice. He’s always behind me<br /><br />I was still in school, yes. I played on the weekend in the first team and then I was in school. I still had some friends in school so everybody used to be like, ‘He played, I saw him on TV!’. It was funny but I am a normal guy, like everybody. I had to go to school to get my diploma and that’s it. The young children at school used to come to me and say, ‘You were on TV yesterday’ and I was like, ‘Yeah it was me.’ I was number 33, I had no name. I was the ‘ghost player’, they called me. It was crazy, quite funny, you know. It was to protect me, when I was really, really young. In France, it is like this, when you are really young they don’t give you a name first, you need to earn it. You need to deserve it, to show and play. Later, I got the shirt with the number four and my name<br /><br />QPR wanted me because of Mark Hughes but then I preferred to stay because I was still young. When I was 18, Inter wanted me and then Chelsea. Other clubs included Newcastle, Monaco, but the thing is, Mourinho called me and I was a big fan of Jose Mourinho when I was younger. He called me and said it was done already, so I went to Chelsea straight away. He called me and he said, ‘Llisten, I want you to come to Chelsea and you will play, if you deserve to play. I know you are young but there’s no age <b>[limit]</b>, if you come to my club then you play’. I did play so I was very happy, I got game time so that was good. For me, I made the right decision. I had no regrets, no nothing. I know I was young, only 19 when I left St. Etienne for Chelsea. I was with Mourinho and I knew I was going to improve myself, improve my game so I was going to Chelsea. It is one of the biggest clubs in the world so I was very, very happy and determined for that. When I signed for Chelsea, it was like when I signed my first contract, it was that same feeling. It was the club that I was dreaming to play for with Mourinho and players like Drogba and John Terry. The players I used to see on TV, I used to pick them on the PlayStation, to play alongside them was crazy. It was quite funny. The feeling, my mother cried again. My father was almost crying and my brothers were so happy for me - so proud and I was proud as well. My brother called me and he was like, ‘Are you going to sign for Chelsea?!’ but I had signed already. ‘Are you going to sign?’ he asked me again. I said, ‘My friend, I did it!’. ‘No way, you play with Drogba, you’re going to play with Drogba?’ I said yes. ‘What about Hazard?’. I said yes. ‘Terry?’ Yes. He was screaming on the phone. My mother was on the phone. They were all happy for me.<br /><br /><b>[It was Drogba who left Zouma most starstruck]</b> Even his name. It is heavy, my friend. He is a big man. Wow, that name is a very, very strong name. I used to watch Didier Drogba. When he was at Marseille and then went to Chelsea I was a big fan of him. The way he scored also was unbelievable. When I arrived I was so happy to be with him as I was a big fan of him. I talked to him every day, he gave me a lot of advice so he was a really, really nice person</p>

  <p><b>[Kurt Zouma sees his long-term future at Chelsea]</b> People know that I’m here for one season and it doesn’t matter what is going to happen after, I hope Stoke are going to stay in the Premier League. My target is to go back to Chelsea, but first do it right here. I don’t want to go down. My target is to go back to Chelsea and play. They gave me a chance to go on loan and I spoke with the manager who agreed with that and they helped me a lot from my injury and to find a club where I can play all the time. Everyone knows I am here for one year and then I’ll go back. Like the other players, we all have to show the fans we want to stay up. There is no difference to me and the other players, we all have to fight to stay up. I don’t think about Chelsea, I just think about Stoke.<br /><br />It’s maybe harder because you don’t want to go in the Championship, so maybe it is a bit harder. But football is football, you have to win games. The thing is we need to pick up points and we are under a little bit of stress but now everybody is calm, we know that with the quality we have that if we play well like we have been the last few weeks, then we are going to get some points and win games. It’s different for me. When I was at Chelsea, we were playing for the title, but, for my experience, it’s good. I’m still young and I’m still learning and to be in this position, I’ve learned a lot. You are a bit under pressure and you don’t want to lose games or make mistakes and you have to get points. But I knew it was going to be like this. There is more defensive work I would say compared with Chelsea where you have the ball more, people are scared of you and you control the game.<br /><br />Stoke is a bit different, it’s a bit more defensive work, especially when we play the top teams like Chelsea, Man City, Man United and Liverpool. You defend more, but I knew that and that’s what I’m here for to work defensively to improve myself and get better. But it’s definitely improved me as a player and a person. I’ve been playing almost the whole season, so I’m very happy with that. For myself, I still have work to but I think I’m getting better and tactically maybe I’ve improved a bit. This year hasn’t finished yet so let’s see what is going to happen, but I feel better</p>

Frenchman Zouma moves from Chelsea and joins Brazil midfielder Bernard, Barcelona trio Yerry Mina, Andre Gomes and Lucas Digne, Richarlison and Joao Virginia in arriving at Goodison in the summer transfer window. After making his debut as a 16-year-old for Saint-Étienne in his homeland, Zouma established himself at the heart of their defence for three seasons before moving to Chelsea.

We are confident, are playing forward more and are playing better and we believe but the season hasn’t finished yet so we have to go again next week and get a win. We are more confident. We hold the ball a bit better, we are more compact as a team as we defend together and attack together. We have the crowd behind, which helps us a lot, so we just need to keep on going like this.</p>

  <p><b>[Zouma: <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> told me I was rubbish at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I cannot remember which match we were playing, we were losing 3-1, away from home. The following day, he <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> catches up with me, he takes me to his office, and he asks me if I am ok. I said yes, he asked me if I was sure. I said yes again, he replied ‘Because you were rubbish this weekend.’ Like that, direct. It shocked me, but it made me want to immediately respond on the pitch. I remember that it hurt me, that it affected me. But I really wanted to show him that I could react<br /><br />He is someone who loves victory. He uses all the tools possible to achieve it. I came here at 19 and he played me. I was able to have my chances, I played my matches. I don’t know what other people think, we all have different opinions, but from my side, I don’t really agree <b>[with the notion that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> does not give young players a chance]</b></p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Kurt Zouma has praised <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> for his maturity and confidence on the ball in the wake of a standout display against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> Unbelievable performance, very mature in his game, and calm and clever as well, with the ball and without the ball. He was fantastic, like he is training. He is training very good. He is very confident and he can keep the ball, he is running around and pressing the guys. He has a bright future ahead of him, he just needs to keep working hard<br /><br /><b>[Zouma went on to urge his team-mates to maintain the same levels of focus they showed against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> arrive at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> for a crucial <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> encounter on Sunday]</b> Everybody was fighting a lot for every ball, everyone running around and defending and attacking. It was a good game to watch I think and we did a very good game.<br /><br />Any clean sheet is good but especially against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We know they have great players up front, they have a great team, and we did very well defensively and it is not just about defenders, all of us as a team played very well defensively, and offensively. We could have scored more.<br /><br />We did a good game but we need to stay focused because there are games when we can play good, and others when we are so-so. Maybe players are a bit tired, I don’t know, maybe we are not focused enough. Against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, this is the mentality we need to keep every game. We have a very important game on Sunday <b>[against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b>, we need to get the win at home and move on from there</p>
