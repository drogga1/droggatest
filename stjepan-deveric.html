<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Luka Modric went from rejected youth player to the best midfielder in the world]</b> With me, even in the Dinamo youth team and later at Zrinjski, Luka was a central midfielder. He was creative and had that extra talent to always find a way to impose <b>[himself]</b>. He was technically perfect and even the hard pitches in the Bosnian league didn’t bother him. He became a leader and it is rare to have an 18-year-old leader in the team. He became much tougher in the Bosnian league. He was very professional and very quiet. He would impose <b>[himself]</b> on the pitch but on other occasions, you would hardly notice him.<br /><br />Another very important reason for his great career is that he grew up without getting almost any injuries. It would have been hard to say back then that he would become the player he is today. Some players get satisfied as soon as they earn their first money after going to a big league, while only the best survive and go all the way. As Luka has done</p>
