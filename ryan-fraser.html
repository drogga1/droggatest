  <p><b>[Ryan Fraser speaks after impressive displays in the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a>]</b> I am not flash at all really, never have been. If fans want to talk to me in Tesco, I will. I am a normal person like anyone else. I just play football</p>

<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have been urged to look at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>’s Ryan Fraser and Brighton duo Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy as they prepare to spend a reported £45 million budget</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Fraser claims to not ‘know what is happening’ when it comes to his future]</b> The lads have been asking. I don’t know myself so there’s no point thinking about it, wherever I’ll be, I’ll be. I don’t know what is happening. I’m not just saying that.<br /><br />Wherever I’ll be, if it’s <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> or if it’s at somebody else, then all you can do is try your best and enjoy football. If you think about anything else, I’ll probably have a bad game<br /><br />On Monday when we trained, I was a shambles, I was so bad. The lads were probably thinking, ‘I don’t think this is Ryan Fraser’. I’m glad I played well against Cyprus. If I didn’t have that four weeks, I could’ve scored a couple. I would have probably scored my chances that I had. On Tuesday, I’ll be better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> star Ryan Fraser has responded to rumours linking him with a move away from Dean Court this summer]</b> I honestly don’t think anyone will be paying that <b>[£30m]</b>. It was six or seven months ago that we last spoke about my future, but nothing since. Even in the end of season meeting I had with the manager <b>[<a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a>]</b>, we didn’t speak about my future. He knows I’m not one to speak about it. If something happens, it will happen. If it doesn’t, then I’m not one to throw my rattle out of the pram. I’ll keep trying my best. I keep getting things tagged on Instagram that I’m going places and I think ‘Am I?’.<br /><br />I’ve got a year left with <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. If I’m there, I’ll give my all. If I’m somewhere else, I’ll give my all. I just want to play well, do my best and work hard for my team-mates. It’s nice <b>[to be linked with big clubs]</b>. But I’m just one of those players who enjoys playing football, wherever I am. I never look too far ahead, I never want to try and think ‘where am I going to be playing?’. Because if you start thinking like that, then you’ll probably start playing badly and not concentrating on the here and now on the pitch. Not once, since the season stopped at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>, have I thought ‘where am I going to be next season?’ It was just about staying fit for the Scotland matches against Cyprus and Belgium and then wherever I’ll be, I’ll be. As long as I’m enjoying my football, that’s all I care about.</p>
