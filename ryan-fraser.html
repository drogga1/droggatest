  <p><b>[Bournemouth star Ryan Fraser has responded to rumours linking him with a move away from Dean Court this summer]</b> I honestly don’t think anyone will be paying that <b>[£30m]</b>. It was six or seven months ago that we last spoke about my future, but nothing since. Even in the end of season meeting I had with the manager <b>[Eddie Howe]</b>, we didn’t speak about my future. He knows I’m not one to speak about it. If something happens, it will happen. If it doesn’t, then I’m not one to throw my rattle out of the pram. I’ll keep trying my best. I keep getting things tagged on Instagram that I’m going places and I think ‘Am I?’.<br /><br />I’ve got a year left with Bournemouth. If I’m there, I’ll give my all. If I’m somewhere else, I’ll give my all. I just want to play well, do my best and work hard for my team-mates. It’s nice <b>[to be linked with big clubs]</b>. But I’m just one of those players who enjoys playing football, wherever I am. I never look too far ahead, I never want to try and think ‘where am I going to be playing?’. Because if you start thinking like that, then you’ll probably start playing badly and not concentrating on the here and now on the pitch. Not once, since the season stopped at Bournemouth, have I thought ‘where am I going to be next season?’ It was just about staying fit for the Scotland matches against Cyprus and Belgium and then wherever I’ll be, I’ll be. As long as I’m enjoying my football, that’s all I care about.</p>
