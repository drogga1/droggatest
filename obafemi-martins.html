  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders forward Obafemi Martins when looking at the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a>, German <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and Italian <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> in comparison to his current division]</b> When you talk about those leagues in Europe, you’re talking about deep, long history. They have all the tradition that comes with years and years. So you can’t just compare a league like <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to those leagues. It’s not fair</p>

  <p><b>[Obafemi Martins on moving from Seattle Sounders to Shanghai Shenhua]</b> Thank you Seattle. Thank you for everything. Thank you for the memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you for the endless love and support, during good times and bad. Thank you to my team-mates and coaches for always believing in me. Something I feel strongly about is challenging myself. When I came to Seattle, it was for the challenge. The challenge of playing in an unknown environment. I can wholeheartedly say that I seized the opportunity in Seattle and gave everything I had for the club. For me it’s now time for a new challenge</p>

  <p><b>[A serious knee injury should’ve ended his career according to many, but he hasn’t given up just yet]</b> I’m 34 but I feel like a teenager, and with this sensation, I can still play for any big team across the world</p>
