  <p><b>[Joel Campbell is due back at Arsenal this summer with his agent eager to point out that the forward is working hard for game time. Joaquim Batica said]</b> At Olympiakos, Joel had important success and the club tried several times to buy him. He was the centrepiece of a club who are regularly champions and make the Champions League - where he scored against Manchester United and they were eliminated. Arsenal have lent him several times, but I emphasise that last year he played about 30 matches in all.<br /><br />At Sporting, I think that overall it has been a difficult season for the club and at the end of the season we saw less game time as a loan player. It is normal that the club favours the players that belong to it.<br /><br />I think that as a 24-year-old player who has played in the Champions League, played a quarter-final of the World Cup, took part in championships in Spain, France, England, Greece, Portugal, he has a very important background. He continues to work every day to accumulate a significant number of games each year</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal and Costa Rica’s Joel Campbell has been handed a major injury blow]</b> We will see what the doctors say, but it is a pretty big tear and I will have to undergo an operation.<br /><br />Leaving the national team is sad and hard to do. It is complicated when you get injured like this, it keeps you out of competitions and from representing your country. I gave it everything, as I always do. Now I have to think about my recovery to come back stronger than ever. I have to keep my head up and think about what’s to come in the hands of God, my family and all those around me</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal forward Joel Campbell looks likely to leave the club this summer]</b> The World Cup won’t change my life, I don’t come here to show myself. I came to help my national team, everyone writes his own history and we have to look after group. I know about my contract and I know who I am. God has a plan for me.<br /><br /><b>[Head coach Oscar Ramirez has come under fire over his use of negative tactics in the opening game]</b> We trust in what our coach thought for this game. He is super able, he decided this and we have to respect it. I think our team tried to do good things independently before I was on the pitch. It was an equal game that was decided by a free kick. Now it is more difficult, but there are two remaining games and we will go to win. It’s a World Cup, here there are the best national teams around the world and we are one of them. We will try to give our best at the next match</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Campbell says he is unsure of his Arsenal future as he returns to the club for pre-season training]</b> This weekend, I’m traveling and they’ll decide what’s coming next. I know that I have a lot left to show in football, so wherever it may be I’ll do things as well as possible to enjoy this sport<br /><br />It was a tough season because of the injury. At the end I grew more as a person because I already had been through the good and the bad of football. Now with this you can be a better person in the face of the future. I’m good, happy about the season that’s coming. I hope it’ll be an important season for me and that God will free me from any injuries so I can give my best</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Campbell has revealed he had been hoping to remain at Arsenal once Unai Emery succeeded Arsene Wenger]</b> To be able to train and to play with those players was great. Wenger is a fairly quiet coach, but I liked him because he was one who gave a lot of freedom to his players on the pitch: he believed in the most technical players and he tried to put them in the starting XI. I have no regrets because I tried to use my opportunities and I don’t think I did badly when I was called into action.<br /><br />This summer I believed I could be part of Emery’s project, I spoke with the coach and the club, I was sure that I could do well in a technical system like that of the Spanish coach but the club had different ideas. It was a great experience that I will never forget because English football is something gigantic.<br /><br />If Juventus sign him then they are making a big signing, because Ramsey is a great player and a very good guy. He’s the archetypal ‘box-to-box’ player, he can play in every position of the midfield. Juventus would become stronger with him<br /><br />I think they have few rivals in Italy because they’re a very strong team in the starting XI, but they also have people on the bench who would be starters in every other team. Then they have Ronaldo, who is a unique player. When you add the greatest player in the world - along with <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, of course - into an already strong team, you become automatically one of the favourites to win the Champions League<br /><br />Every game is a battle, every team is so well-organised, there are few spaces and it’s really hard to score. Everybody says that Italian football is very tactical and it’s true, but there are other leagues like that, such as the French one. In my opinion what makes Italian football so unique is the defensive phase. Ligue 1 is influenced by freshness, strength and athleticism of the young players, in Spain they prefer technique, in England there is less tactics and more intensity<br /><br />I was welcomed very warmly by the club, by my team-mates and the fans. Serie A is one of the best European divisions, the competition is very fierce and the quality is high. I’m very satisfied with the choice I made. Here at Frosinone, everything is very professional. The club is very professional, takes care of everything that the players need, the stadium is a gem and the fans are great. I would say they are more like South Americans than English, because they are very passionate and they always support us, both in good times and in the more difficult moments.<br /><br />There is the right spirit on the field and away from the pitch to do great things. We’re considered doomed by many, but we believe we can avoid relegation. We battle day by day, we have a strong, compact group and the distance from those who are above us is not so big - a couple of victories and everything comes back into the equation</p>
