  <p><b>[Arsenal forward Joel Campbell looks likely to leave the club this summer]</b> The World Cup won’t change my life, I don’t come here to show myself. I came to help my national team, everyone writes his own history and we have to look after group. I know about my contract and I know who I am. God has a plan for me.<br /><br /><b>[Head coach Oscar Ramirez has come under fire over his use of negative tactics in the opening game]</b> We trust in what our coach thought for this game. He is super able, he decided this and we have to respect it. I think our team tried to do good things independently before I was on the pitch. It was an equal game that was decided by a free kick. Now it is more difficult, but there are two remaining games and we will go to win. It’s a World Cup, here there are the best national teams around the world and we are one of them. We will try to give our best at the next match</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Campbell says he is unsure of his Arsenal future as he returns to the club for pre-season training]</b> This weekend, I’m traveling and they’ll decide what’s coming next. I know that I have a lot left to show in football, so wherever it may be I’ll do things as well as possible to enjoy this sport<br /><br />It was a tough season because of the injury. At the end I grew more as a person because I already had been through the good and the bad of football. Now with this you can be a better person in the face of the future. I’m good, happy about the season that’s coming. I hope it’ll be an important season for me and that God will free me from any injuries so I can give my best</p>
