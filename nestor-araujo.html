  <p><b>[On fans]</b> I think that despite all the draws and not having been able to get victories, the fans are responding, in a way, because they know Santos is killing it, leaving it all on the field, and I think the fans are going to keep following the team as they have been.</p>

  <p><b>[Nestor Araujo will report to Mexico national team camp Monday but says he’s still not totally fit]</b> I’m still not at 100 percent, but Monday I’ll talk with Juan Carlos and see what happens. I’m not at the World Cup yet but we’re hoping.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico national team center back Nestor Araujo is joining La Liga club Celta de Vigo]</b> It’s an opportunity, a new stage to continue growing and to fulfill my dream and the end of a great cycle at Santos Laguna. My family and I are very happy to come to Europe, arrive to a team like Celta Vigo, and to have the opportunity to demonstrate what I can do and put Mexico’s name on high. I’m very grateful and I don’t get tired of saying it. The best decision I’ve made in my career was to play for Santos Laguna</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico center back Nestor Araujo says he reviewed his errors in last week’s friendly loss to Argentina and plans to use them to improve]</b> I think the fans always will have the right to express their opinion and I’ll always respect what they think. Of course it wasn’t a good game, and I made really rough errors. I think, ultimately, the mistakes a player makes or a person in general make you better. I’m sure this is going to help me learn. Analyzing every play, I knew right away, I understood what I should’ve done on every one of them. Now, of course, they shouldn’t happen again. The first goal, the pass to the interior midfielder, on the second staying with the player. I looked at every one of the plays. Fans have the right, but it’s about lifting yourself up and learning from it. I’m going to keep getting better, fighting, growing, and I’m sure I’m better because of the lesson<br /><br /><b>[He’ll likely start this weekend against <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, where compatriot Hector Herrera is yet to make his debut]</b> It’s clear the player Herrera is. At some point, he’ll be joining in. Nobody doubts the excellent player he is and that he’ll have minutes and play well when the time comes<br /><br /><b>[Celta has four points through four rounds and sit near the bottom of a jam-packed table in Spain, but Araujo said the team may have a bit of a leg up this weekend]</b> It’s good because we’re going to watch it, see how they line up. It’s well known how Atletico plays, but it’s always good to see how they’re coming in and plan the game</p>
