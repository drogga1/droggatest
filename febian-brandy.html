  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> can emulate Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid success]</b> What Real Madrid have done with Zidane is what Man United have done with Ole. Zidane went to Madrid, he played for Madrid, was a legend there and knows the club inside out. They brought someone back who knows the club, who can steady the ship a little bit. I think in the modern-day football industry, and with the modern players out there, you do need someone who club inside out.<br /><br />Just from my experience of being with Ole and knowing what type of person he is and how he can bring the best out of players, when I saw him get appointed I wasn’t shocked. I had Ole at Man United for two or three years. He’s just a people person. He treats everyone the same, whether you’re the star in the first team or whether you’re the receptionist at the training ground. He literally just treats everyone with the highest level of respect. He knows Man United like the back of his hand, he knows the club. I think that’s key with Man United. It’s already been shown. You can’t just throw anyone in there with a big name. You need to throw someone in there who knows the club, who knows the players, who knows the staff and who knows the core of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Febian Brandy reveals Ole’s Man Utd]</b> They weren’t really a team where you’ve got to wait until you’re 18 or 19 so you can start playing in the first team. There was a time I trained with the first team when I was 15 at one stage. It gives the players no limit to when they can be a first-team player. If you keep working hard, you just never know when you’ll get called up.<br /><br />My time at Man United we had the likes of Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, Gary Neville, <b>[Edwin]</b> Van der Sar, <b>[Paul]</b> Scholesy, Ole, <b>[Nemanja]</b> Vidic, the list goes on. We knew what these guys were like. We’d see them week in, week out, we’d see how they conducted themselves on the pitch, we’d see when they’d won the Premier League or they’d won the Champions League, they’re not big-headed or anything like that. We’ve won the Champions League, we’ll celebrate a little bit but then, it’s straight back to work. Me being at Man United as long as I was, I’d see that constantly, every season. Their attitude embedded in me and the other players there. We had a strong dressing room and they kept us all in line. At the same time, if you need any advice, you could talk to them about anything. They were all like big brothers to us; they all looked out for us whenever we needed it.<br /><br />You never went in there thinking: ‘This is my job’. You always went there to enjoy yourself and express yourself. There’s a level of relaxation and it’s chilled out. Obviously, there’s pressure to get into the first team, but the coaches don’t really put that pressure on you. They let the players express themselves and move naturally. That way you can get the best out of players and that’s been key to why United have had so many players from the academy go to the first team. They’ve had good coaches who know how to let players from whatever age express themselves. It’s key for them to get into the first team. When players realise they’ve got that kind of freedom at a club, that’s where Man United get the best of them. Down the years it’s worked for them. With United, if someone’s got an idea from the academy, then one of the coaches from the first team might take that idea. Then they all kind of bounce off each other. That’s been crucial. Jesse and Pogba are the next batch of the core to be those type of players at Man United like the Rios, the Vidics, the Gaz Nevs when I was there. They’ve had that before. The academy players coming through now will be looking up to Paul and Jesse and thinking we can see how they conduct themselves - how their attitude is, Paul and Jesse will embed that in the new batch coming through<br /><br />Ole’s about overall development. The managers that have been in there, Ole’s not had the level of CV they’ve had, but he knows the club more than them. That’s key with Man United. That’s been shown. You can’t just throw anyone in there with a big name, you need to throw someone in there who knows the club, who knows the players, who knows the staff, who knows the core of the club<br /><br />Every player is different. One player might need a rollicking to get him riled up. Another player might need bit of comforting. I’m not saying you let players do what they want or anything like that; it’s just about being a people person and knowing how to man-manage people in different ways. If I came in training, upset for whatever reason or a little bit down, Ole would just look at me and say: ‘What’s up?’ And I’d say: ‘Nothing.’ And then he’d probably make a joke. And whatever was bothering me was gone. I’d go out and train and I’d have a very good training session, just from him saying those little words. It’s hard to describe but he’s just such a good person, a people person, a good guy and a good manager. I looked up to him. As I got older, he started to come to watch our sessions. That was a buzz for me - someone who I looked up to was actually coming to watch our sessions and to give us advice as well<br /><br />It wasn’t complicated at all. We would do our shape building up to the games. The talks would be short and sharp; he’s calm and collected. For me, he would say next game make those runs in behind and you’ll see what happens. Then the game would come, I’d make the runs in behind and before you know it we’re 3-0 up. It’s like he has the ability to see the game before it’s played<br /><br />You can see a change since Ole’s come in, from the previous managers who’ve been at Man United. You can see the difference in the play, in the players’ attitude. It’s the same as when Sir Alex was there. Man United, they are getting that fear factor back into Old Trafford from that attacking football. Everyone is happy in there, they feel relaxed and they can express themselves. You can see the proof on the pitch, with the performances and how the players are</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United striker Febian Brandy is bringing his expertise and know-how to a new app called Skouted]</b> I was at Man Utd from the age of eight to 21, 22. I was fortunate to be there for a long period of time but as I was there I developed friendships with players there. They didn’t get contracts, but they didn’t really have the connections to go to another team in a lower league than Man Utd. They might not have had the ability to stay at Man Utd but they would have had the ability to go somewhere else and make a career out of football. Then they would think what happens next. Because they didn’t have the connections they would fall out of love with football.<br /><br />With Skouted they would be able to upload their clips and let other teams see their talent and teams would approach them. You sign up, you create your profile, you can jazz yourself up a bit with it. Once you’ve created the profile the aim of it is to upload your clips and let clubs see you. There’s going to be loads of fun features, there’ll be goal of the month, you can win player of the season, little things like that<br /><br />From a club’s perspective, if they wanted to see a player miles away, they would just use the search bar. The club would be able to see all the videos of that specific player that they put into the criteria bar. We are not trying to eliminate the human element of scouts going to watch players. Sometimes you need to see someone on a personal level. But it would help clubs save money but get a wider vision of what type of players they can get. It’s to make life easier for clubs getting players and for scouts getting to know players as well<br /><br />I was quite fortunate at Man Utd to have the reputation I had from a young lad growing into a man. I was quite well known in the football industry. When my contract ended at Man Utd I had clubs saying: ‘We’ll take him’. There are players who have not been as fortunate as me, who have not had the reputation growing up. For them when the contract’s finished it’s: ‘What now?’. They don’t know who to contact and there’s no one contacting them. In football when your phone’s not ringing it can be a bit of a nerve-racking experience<br /><br />We’re losing a lot <b>[of talent]</b>. When a player is growing and gets released at the age of 16, he’s not fully developed yet. You see players who are now playing in the Premier League who no one really knew about when they were 16, 17. For a player to drop out of the game when they are 15, 16, 17, we’re wasting talent. I’m not saying everyone’s talented <b>[enough]</b> but the talented ones who do get released and have not got anywhere to go<br /><br />You can either go from the top into the Skouted world or from the bottom into the Skouted world. From the top level it would be like players who have not got a contract at a pro level and fell out but who want to stay in the game and help themselves get a club. From the bottom it’s a platform for players in Sunday leagues and non-leagues who wouldn’t really get the exposure to the teams at the top level. We’re trying to bring the top and the bottom closer together, to bridge that gap. We’re trying to make it the home of football for everyone. If you’re a player, if you’re a scout, if you’re someone who just wants to come on and see a player do a nutmeg or a stepover. It’s going to be the platform for the home of football. Skouted is a platform that me and my team have created, to bridge the gap between clubs at the elite level to players from grassroots. So, players from all ages - boys and girls - don’t fall through the net and fall out of love with football. The football industry has changed massively. There are a lot of things in football that relate to the social side of things. It was a good time to bring something like Skouted to the football industry to connect everyone together. Fans, football clubs, players at all levels, just kind of make it one family</p>
