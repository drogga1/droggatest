  <p><b>[Dave Rogers, coach of DSK Shivajians who suffered a 1-0 reverse to rivals Mumbai FC in their opening match]</b> It’s exciting. There are no easy games in this league. We’re playing against one of the most recognisable and successful teams in the country. We’re prepared and ready to take them head on. We’re the new club and they’re the giants of Indian football but we’re working hard and trying to build the club. We don’t set targets. Our football club only wants progress. We take one game at a time. We’ll reassess at the end of the season. We want to win football games the right way. We are building the club with focus on grassroots and the foundation. That’s what we are all about. Success doesn’t come overnight. We want to become successful by developing our own stars. We’re trying to stabilise this club<br /><br /><b>[On Subrata Pal]</b> Subrata? he trained today. We’ll make some assessments and decide tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[DSK Shivajians picked their first full points of the I-League season as they downed Chennai City FC 2-0 at the Balewadi Sports Complex]</b> We dominated the game and were really fired up. This win was long overdue. We didn’t get rewards we deserved earlier. There are no easy games. The boys became men. We have boys that train every day. I see togetherness and hard work. I’ve been watching Milan <b>[Singh]</b> closely. He can offer a lot. Jerry at left back is still learning. It’s the players who win matches, not formations. I don’t worry about other clubs. We have some great staff and an owner <b>[Shirish Kulkarni]</b> who is wonderful. He believes what I believe in and wants to develop Indian football. We want to become the most unique club in Indian football<br /><br /><b>[On why Quero was substituted in the 65th minute]</b> He oozes energy. He loves playing football. I need to manage him. It was a good opportunity to bring him off. He’s not happy, but understands. He’s got lots of charisma. I felt I could get the best out of him. He’s lost a lot of his temper. I treat footballers like men. He’s trying to learn Hindi. The boys love him and he’s pivotal.<br /><br />For me it’s not about the names on the back of the shirt, it’s about the badge on the shirt. Players must perform on a daily basis. I’m building a club and from scratch to change Indian football.<br /><br /><b>[On Kim Song-Yong]</b> Kim’s work rate was excellent. He is a superb professional and human being. He is the best player at holding the ball up<br /><br /><b>[OnSubrata Paul’s injury]</b> When he’s fit, he’ll play</p>

  <p><b>[DSK Shivjians will have met Churchill Brothers]</b> Looking forward to playing Churchill. It’s good to see them back in the I-League, that is the place where they belong.<br /><br /><b>[The Red Machines have failed to register even a single point]</b> I don’t expect to any game easy. Just because Churchill haven’t won a game yet, we were in the same position after two matches. In this league, anybody is capable of beating anybody on their day. They might not have a little bit of luck in their games, it was the same with us in our first two</p>

  <p><b>[Draw between DSK Shivajians and Mohun Bagan. Dave Rogers claimed that he was disappointed not to have won]</b> Tonight’s performance is not a surprise to me at all. After every game, we are improving. We were the dominant team from the kickoff tonight and it feels like a defeat, to be honest. We’ve battled and outplayed a really good team. We scored a great goal as well but only the referee knows why it was disallowed.<br /><br /><b>[On specific plan to nullify Sony Norde]</b> I’m being paid for devising the tactics. That’s what top coaches do. We analyse every team that we come up against. We do it over a couple of weeks.<br /><br />We played five at the back to combat their front four <b>[Duffy, Norde, Jeje, Yusa]</b>. If you give good players space, they’ll hurt you. So we nullified them and restricted space. Young Sairuat Kima who came into the side did a really good job. He played the first game away to Mumbai and then had less chances. But for me, he was colossal at the back. Sasa <b>[Kolunija]</b>, Nirmal <b>[Chettri]</b>, Jerry <b>[Lalrinzuala]</b> and Gouramangi <b>[Singh]</b> were all good<br /><br />We’re unbeaten for 3 games now. It’s a marathon and not a sprint. We have fantastic team spirit and we have started the season well. We’re developing these boys the right way</p>

  <p><b>[DSK Shivajians lost their fifth I-League game this season as they were trounced 3-0 by Churchill Brothers on Sunday evening at the Tilak Maidan]</b> I knew Derrick would be fired up. For our boys, that’s probably the worst performance. No excuses. The only great spot was our 17-year-old academy player <b>[Pranjal Bhumij]</b> who was a bit unlucky to score. The second half performance was not acceptable. Credit to Churchill who took the chances and scored the goals in the second half.<br /><br />I have five injuries - regular first team players including Kim Song-Yong and two regular India internationals. But it’s not all gloomy when we finish with six U-22 players on the pitch. For me that’s the bright spot. It’s another away game <b>[next]</b>, our fifth away game in three weeks. We’ve travelled the length of India in the last couple of weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC’s Khalid Jamil - ‘The players were aware of East Bengal’s result’]</b> Aizawl, they offered nothing tonight. Let’s be honest, we were the better team. They have not tried to play football. We played our last game only 48 hours back. So, I’m proud of my players and we have outplayed the potential league champions of this season. But again, that’s what they’ve been good at. They contain teams and nick in goals and they have done that to us twice now. It is tough to take. We are devastated but we have a game on Saturday and we need to win it. Football can be wonderful and at the same time cruel<br /><br />I was frustrated. We had more chances but they scored the goal. I have said it all along - If you don’t score goals, you don’t win games. Unfortunately, we can’t score goals at the minute. We are creating so many chances but we haven’t got the killer instinct. I’m not going to blame individuals here but there comes a time when somebody has to step up and score goals<br /><br />I hope they go on and win the championship now. After being relegated last season, they have done well to become well-organised. I think Khalid <b>[Jamil]</b> deserves it</p>

  <p><b>[When quizzed on the departures after the Aizawl loss, particularly Barry Knowles]</b> No comment on that. The lads <b>[media and press relations department]</b> will take of that. It doesn’t matter who’s on the bench, I’m still in charge.</p>

  <p><b>[Dave Rogers says ‘Subrata Paul has cost DSK Shivajians points for the third time now and it’s not acceptable]</b> Individual mistakes have cost us games and the guy who has cost us the game today has done it for the third time - Subrata Paul. I have told him straight that this is neither good enough nor acceptable.<br /><br />I cannot fault my players for the attitude and the application and the characteristics after being two-nil down. It’s another game that we have dominated. We hit the crossbar twice and had many opportunities, but if you make mistakes like that, you don’t deserve to win games of football and Subrata Paul knows better<br /><br />I replaced Quero because he wasn’t doing good in the second half. Quero is a fantastic player but no player, no coach is bigger than the club. The tactical change worked. The two young boys came in and it gave us more energy and balance<br /><br />Subrata is big enough to take it on the chin and he will move on. I will defend my players as much as I can, but I won’t defend that mistake from Subrata which he has done for the third time now. <b>[The]</b> 94th minute against Bengaluru, we lose two points; 93rd minute against Shillong Lajong, we lose another three points. He also cost us three points against Mohun Bagan <b>[away]</b>. Keepers and outfield players make mistakes, but I’ve told him <b>[Subrata]</b> and he knows it - that it’s unacceptable to make the same mistakes and expect to win games</p>
