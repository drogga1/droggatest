  <p><b>[Troy Parrott’s talent was evident from a young age, with the striker initially playing in older age groups before becoming part of Belvedere’s Under-10 side, where he learned his trade under the tutelage of coaches Darragh O’Reilly and Austin Skelly]</b> We would have known him from around the area in the north inner city. He was obviously a very good player from the start and a nice kid off the pitch. We had him from about 10 until the time he went away <b>[to Tottenham]</b>. You could see he had ability. With all of them at that age, around 10 or so, you never know how they’ll turn out, but with him, you could see that street footballer style about him. He would have played an awful lot when he was living in the area. He was just a natural sort of player. Very clever, shrewd on the ball and always had that ruthless eye for goal, even when he was that young. He played in a lot of positions for us, but he’d never sulk about it. Even if he had to play two or three games in the same weekend, he’d just get on with it. He loved it. He just loved playing football.<br /><br /><b>[As a 12-year-old, Parrott played for Belvedere against the youth teams of <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> clubs in a tournament in Germany]</b> It was then that our eyes were really opened to what he could potentially do. He stood out a mile in that tournament. While we were watching that match, even before it finished, every scout that was at it was coming over or calling us up after it and inviting him over for a few days or a week’s trial. It kind of just progressed from there. He was with a few other clubs before he went to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. He was with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> a few times, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, Celtic. But when he first went to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, he took to it straight away. Up to that point, all the bells and whistles at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were attractive, but as soon as he went to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, he came back and said ‘I loved it.’ He felt a little bit at home there.</p>

  <p><b>[Darragh O’Reilly on Troy Parrott]</b> He’s just gone from strength to strength. He’s done that since as young as I can remember. Every little step up that’s put in front of him or every little challenge, he just thrives at it. Whether that was league representative stuff or international call ups or being pushed up to older ages with the international team or with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, he just takes it all in his stride. He’s the talk of the town now. With the ability he has and he’s such a natural goalscorer, I’d like to think he can go very far. He can play at the top level, as long as things go well. If someone can score goals so naturally the way he does, I think he can go as far as he wants to go</p>
