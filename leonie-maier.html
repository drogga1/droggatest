  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Leonie Maier is excited to play in the ‘amazing’ FA Women’s Super League after securing a ‘dream’ move this summer]</b> It’s a great honour for me to be here. I’m very proud to be part of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> family. I’m very happy to be here. I played six years for Bayern and it was time to start something new. <b>[Last season]</b> was really difficult for me because I didn’t know the situation. I had a little injury during the winter break, so I missed three games and it was hard to come back to the starting XI because we had a strong squad in Munich. We played very well and we had no reason to change anything. It was a hard time for me but I also learned in this time. It has always been a dream playing abroad and I think the Women’s Super League has developed in an amazing way for the last few years. <a href="joe-montemurro.html">Joe Montemurro</a> <b>[manager]</b> also convinced me with his idea of playing football. That is the reason I came to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I also would like to win more trophies, with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> hopefully<br /><br /><b>[As well as Maier, both Manuela Zinsberger and Jill Roord moved from Munich to the red side of north London this summer, so she is not alone in making the necessary adjustments]</b> I think that is the reason it was easy for me to fit in very quickly. <b>[Zinsberger and Roord]</b> are very good players and will bring a lot with their quality and experience. Also, the attitude we learned in Germany, it’s a very strong and tough attitude and a lot of pushing. Hopefully we can help <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> here with our experience. I also knew my old team-mates, Vikki Schnaderbeck, Lisa Evans, Viv Miedema. I knew a lot of players here. There were other clubs <b>[interested]</b>, but I had a very good feeling here with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, especially with Joe and the whole club. Here we have professional facilities and I think we can continue to improve ourselves every day. I really like it here<br /><br />I think it’s a good sign for women’s football that big clubs are having women’s teams. I think Germany has to do this also. We have just <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, Wolfsburg, Hoffenheim, but that’s not that big a club. I think they have to invest more money also for women’s teams. In England, it’s a very good development here. It was also a reason for me to come to England because the league here has developed in a very good way in the last few years<br /><br /><b>[Whether that will be from the start or not is unclear - and another sign of how strong <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s squad this season is]</b> I think it’s always good for a player to have competition. You have to work hard and give everything every training and every game give your best performance. That’s the best way to getting better as a player but also as a team</p>
