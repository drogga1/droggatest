  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced that it has signed Norwegian international defender Vadim Demidov who joins from Norwegian side SK Brann]</b> We’re getting a very talented player and a leader on the pitch. Vadim will provide us that winning mentality and work ethic that’s so important for a club in growth, he fits the mold of the players we desire for in this club. We are thrilled to get a player and leader of his caliber.</p>

  <p><b>[Abu Danladi’s delayed arrival finally happens]</b> I don’t think there’s an MLS club who doesn’t know Abu Danladi over the last three years. Everybody’s watched him. The reason we chose him is because he has the most upside of anybody in the draft. If everything comes to fruition, we think we’re going to have one of the best young talents in MLS.<br /><br />It was going to take something exceptional to trade the pick. One team offered us quite a lot of money and a player, the player wasn’t what we were looking for. It was going to have to be nearly perfect for us to give up what we were getting. The outlying plus for us is the fact that his ceiling is so high. He’s got really good runs now for a young guy. I like his pace, and his runs. He still has some stuff to work on, but he’s got the one commodity nobody likes to play against, which is pace<br /><br />The only issue people thought about was the season he just had, when he had a lot of niggling injuries. We spoke about that when we interviewed him, and I was right in his face and let him know this isn’t Santa Barbara, this isn’t L.A. You’re coming to Minnesota and I need to know from you that you want to come</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced the signing of Finnish international midfielder Rasmus Schuller from Sweden’s BK Hacken]</b> He’s the perfect age for our club at 25. He’s an experienced national team player with Finland. When we were first looking at him he kept jumping out at us. We spoke to his national team coach and former head coach and each were incredibly complimentary of his talents and his character</p>

  <p><b>[Does Minnesota United have enough to compete in year one?]</b> They’ve decided to spend a lot of money on players, which is great for them and I wish them luck. We’re going down a different route, but I don’t look across at Atlanta with any envy.<br /><br />You’re always a little bit apprehensive because you’re never sure quite how it’s going to go. But the one thing that I do know is the likes of Rasmus Schuller, the likes of Francisco Calvo and Vadim Demidov, they’re experienced guys. They play week in, week out for their teams in their respective countries, they’re internationals<br /><br /><b>[On Kevin Molino]</b> Without a shadow of a doubt. He thrives on big games, he thrives on being an important piece. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, one or two people thought we gave up a lot for him, I actually thought we got him cheap<br /><br />I worked with this guy for five years every day, I know what he’s capable of. This is a guy who Kaka, after a week of working with him, said he could play in any league in the world. I hold him to the highest standards every single day because I know what he’s capable of and I’ve told him he has the ability to be the best player in this league<br /><br />We were proud to have such a good first season in MLS with Orlando. I’m going to do everything I can to make this club as successful as it can be and give the people who own the club and the people of Minnesota a club they can be proud of.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has signed defensive midfielder Luiz Fernando from Fluminense on loan for the 2018 season with an option to buy]</b> He brings a different element. He is very, very physically strong and his athleticism can break plays up. His feet are very tidy. So, we’re really pleased to bring him in.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced the signing of Cameroon international defender Bertrand Owundi Eko’o on a free transfer from Rainbow FC]</b> The thing we’ve tried to do this offseason is bring in some younger players who we feel have a chance of progressing and being big pieces for us moving forward. For what we’ve got these kids for salary-wise, what we’ve had to give up, we think we’ve done really well. We’re excited about what we’ve got with him and Pangop. We felt it wasn’t a gamble, but an opportunity to bring in two young pieces for not a lot of financial output that we think have got huge upside.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced the signing of Colombian forward Angelo Rodríguez on a Designated Player contract]</b> He is a big-time player. We have just added a difference-maker to our roster. He’s a player who is physical, skilled and knows how to score. He holds up the ball well and is also able to turn and run at defenders. He causes stress on defenses by closing down and pressing. He has seen some of the best competition in Colombia and has stepped up in big moments. We are thrilled to bring another valuable addition to Minnesota.<br /><br /><b>[On Romario Ibarra]</b> We have been looking for some change-of-game pace for the team and that’s one of the best things Romario does: He changes games with his pace and he challenges defenders. He’s of a great age at 23 and he has had a good start to his career. He has just broken into the Ecuador national team, which is one of the premier national teams in South America. It’s a big step for us, a real investment on behalf of the club and I am delighted. Can’t wait to get him here, can’t wait to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United announced the signing of Jan Gregus as the club’s third ever designated player]</b> The one thing that sticks out is his composure on the ball. He’s got a great range of passes, both short and long. He has a great stride to goal, and an imposing stature at 6 foot 3 inches. The fact that he’s in his pomp - what we consider his prime - we think we have acquired him at the right time in his career. We know we’ve got excellent attacking pieces on the roster, but we need to be able to supply the ball to those pieces and we feel that Jan can be the supplier and connector from the midfield to the attack.</p>

I was so pleased for Dr. McGuire and the ownership group, it was something that was a dream, pie-in-the-sky two or three years ago, and now to see the stadium full, the atmosphere in the stadium, I was really pleased for a lot of people.<br /><br /><b>[3-3 draw with New York City FC]</b> I’m sure for the neutral it was an entertaining game, but not too good for both coaches I wouldn’t have thought</p>

In the past it’s been a place for top stars to wind down their careers, but I think that will change. The arrival of <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> and Miami will help accelerate that switch in mentality</p>
