  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced that it has signed Norwegian international defender Vadim Demidov who joins from Norwegian side SK Brann]</b> We’re getting a very talented player and a leader on the pitch. Vadim will provide us that winning mentality and work ethic that’s so important for a club in growth, he fits the mold of the players we desire for in this club. We are thrilled to get a player and leader of his caliber.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has signed defensive midfielder Luiz Fernando from Fluminense on loan for the 2018 season with an option to buy]</b> He brings a different element. He is very, very physically strong and his athleticism can break plays up. His feet are very tidy. So, we’re really pleased to bring him in.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced the signing of Cameroon international defender Bertrand Owundi Eko’o on a free transfer from Rainbow FC]</b> The thing we’ve tried to do this offseason is bring in some younger players who we feel have a chance of progressing and being big pieces for us moving forward. For what we’ve got these kids for salary-wise, what we’ve had to give up, we think we’ve done really well. We’re excited about what we’ve got with him and Pangop. We felt it wasn’t a gamble, but an opportunity to bring in two young pieces for not a lot of financial output that we think have got huge upside.</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United has announced the signing of Colombian forward Angelo Rodríguez on a Designated Player contract]</b> He is a big-time player. We have just added a difference-maker to our roster. He’s a player who is physical, skilled and knows how to score. He holds up the ball well and is also able to turn and run at defenders. He causes stress on defenses by closing down and pressing. He has seen some of the best competition in Colombia and has stepped up in big moments. We are thrilled to bring another valuable addition to Minnesota.<br /><br /><b>[On Romario Ibarra]</b> We have been looking for some change-of-game pace for the team and that’s one of the best things Romario does: He changes games with his pace and he challenges defenders. He’s of a great age at 23 and he has had a good start to his career. He has just broken into the Ecuador national team, which is one of the premier national teams in South America. It’s a big step for us, a real investment on behalf of the club and I am delighted. Can’t wait to get him here, can’t wait to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United announced the signing of Jan Gregus as the club’s third ever designated player]</b> The one thing that sticks out is his composure on the ball. He’s got a great range of passes, both short and long. He has a great stride to goal, and an imposing stature at 6 foot 3 inches. The fact that he’s in his pomp - what we consider his prime - we think we have acquired him at the right time in his career. We know we’ve got excellent attacking pieces on the roster, but we need to be able to supply the ball to those pieces and we feel that Jan can be the supplier and connector from the midfield to the attack.</p>

  <p><b>[Allianz Field opens as Minnesota United gets its own soccer cathedral]</b> We knew it was going to be a quite an emotional day and I was really proud for a lot of people. I was so pleased for Dr. McGuire and the ownership group, it was something that was a dream, pie-in-the-sky two or three years ago, and now to see the stadium full, the atmosphere in the stadium, I was really pleased for a lot of people.<br /><br /><b>[3-3 draw with New York City FC]</b> I’m sure for the neutral it was an entertaining game, but not too good for both coaches I wouldn’t have thought</p>

  <p><b>[Minnesota United manager Adrian Heath says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> could both end up joining <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> at new <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise Inter Miami]</b> That would be incredible for football in the USA and if anyone has the global profile to make that dream a reality then it has to be <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>. It may not happen just yet, but I can see <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> following in the footsteps of <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> playing in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. For <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, the two obvious destinations if they came to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> would be Los Angeles and Miami. And, with his links to both players and the plan <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> and his backers have in place, I can really only see them going to Miami<br /><br />I believe the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> has the potential to become one of the top leagues in the world. In the past it’s been a place for top stars to wind down their careers, but I think that will change. The arrival of <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> and Miami will help accelerate that switch in mentality</p>
