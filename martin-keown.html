  <p><b>[Martin Keown believes the lack of desire shown by the Gunners’ second-string in Wednesday’s EFL Cup quarter-final clash should concern Arsene Wenger]</b> Arsene Wenger sees his priorities as the Premier League, then the Champions League, then the FA Cup, then the League Cup - in that order. He has an astonishing record in the FA Cup. The League Cup has more often been a breeding ground for future players to see if they can cut it, or a place to give squad players an opportunity to impress.<br /><br />The defeat by Southampton will have been worrying for Wenger as the players didn’t seem to have any desire. There was enough on the pitch for Arsenal to win that match. Francis Coquelin and Mohamed Elneny both started at Old Trafford in the League, Aaron Ramsey has played in the Mesut Ozil role to great effect for Wales and Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs have both won England caps. But there was no urgency to their play. They didn’t seem to create anything. It was all very safe, passing the ball in front of their opponents. Wenger will have been disappointed by Jenkinson - he looked devoid of confidence. Somewhere along the line Wenger has to motivate these players to give more when they play.</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown acknowledges that Arsenal fans may not be too happy with Arsene Wenger being offered a contract extension]</b> Arsene Wenger will decide when he leaves the club. I believe that he manages up and down within the club. They’re going to want to have a run-up to a succession plan at Arsenal Football Club and that will mean Arsene Wenger signing a new deal. I don’t know if that sits completely well with the fans. If you look at other situations, Manchester United losing Sir Alex Ferguson, I believe he’ll sign a new contract. It’s just really the announcement. When is the right time? Of course he needs to continue to do well enough to stay in the job. If he gets in the Champions League once more, wins a trophy … I know people are dissatisfied with that and feel change is necessary. But it could also go completely the other way if Arsenal were to leap now and make a big change. It sits with the way he is as a manager to see the job through to the end of the season and I do see him signing a new deal. That will be the last one and Arsenal will be looking to make a plan in that period.</p>

It’s just about finding the right time to announce that. I don’t know if the players could cope with him saying that he’s about to leave. That might be the only reason he’s not making any kind of announcement, because it might affect the group. The writing is firmly on the wall. I just feel the manager needs to give some kind of indication as to what is going to happen. Is he staying there or is he going to go? The performances are disintegrating and they don’t seem to be together as a group. I’ve never seen this before with Arsene Wenger</p>

They are two special players for <b>[Arsene]</b> Wenger. He warms to players who are particularly gifted with the ball - they are the core of his beliefs in football. But there can be problems if you over indulge them. When there was talk of Sanchez and Ozil wanting out, it coincided with Arsenal losing seven games in 12 and getting knocked out of the Champions League.<br /><br />Sanchez and Ozil downed tools during those games. There is a fear that if Arsenal give them ridiculous sums of money to stay, they could throw their toys out of the pram once more when things go wrong. It seems unlikely that they will stay at the club.</p>

If he wins, Wenger will have won a record seventh FA Cup against a side that has been utterly dominant this season. Winning the Cup would be the perfect time to bow out, but I think it would reaffirm his belief that he can still do the job. I believe Wenger will stay even if Arsenal lose, but he will have to ask himself some searching questions.<br /><br />It may feel like he would be doing a holding job until another man comes in. The greatest gift Wenger can give to Arsenal is to help identify his successor. The club is like a family business being passed down through the generations. Wenger sees Arsenal as his family and will want to be part of the process to plan for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal captain Martin Keown believes the club should sell star players Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez]</b> If they have to say cheerio to those two players, then that is the right decision. They have been overindulged at times this season and they let Arsenal down in the period when they lost twice to Bayern Munich, conceding 10 goals. That is the level of the problem. The manager needs to make some really tough decisions now. Sanchez’s contract needs to get 100% secured. Is that going to happen? Will Ozil leave? I am sure both players want to go elsewhere because they want to win the Champions League, win the Premier League and maybe they do not feel it can be done at Arsenal. The club is bigger than two individuals.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal will certainly offer Jack Wilshere a new contract]</b> We know Jack is a special talent. His injuries have marred his career. It must be tough for Arsene Wenger to watch. How many times has he broken ankles and had operations? His quality isn’t in doubt, it’s his health that’s the issue. There are some big decisions to be made but I would feel he is someone Wenger would try to keep. Somebody that he will try to support. They certainly will offer him a new contract.<br /><br />Whether or not the player will get quite the lucrative contract he might have got in the past, or the length of the contract, may be an issue but he <b>[Wenger]</b> will try to support him because he’s a huge fan. Jack’s come through the youth system. He will try and protect him as best he can but what the player needs is luck. He’s gone from playing for England to not being first team selection at Bournemouth and that will hurt him. He may well have got injured but he sat and watched a lot of football last season when he was at Bournemouth. He needs to get fit again, but we’ve said that so many times</p>

Wenger will be relying on the fact he’s someone who loves playing football and giving his all. They can work something out because he’s certainly made his mark at the club and been successful, so if he’s going to go he should do it in a dignified way.<br /><br />He signed a contract in good faith and - while he could probably move and earn a lot more money at another club - sometimes it’s about carrying on with dignity and respect and finishing the job. That’s what he should do at Arsenal. Wenger is probably hoping he can somehow win the Premier League and keep Sanchez, meet his needs from a trophy point of view and find some way to match his contract demands - but I don’t see that happening</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil sees contribution to Arsenal cause questioned by Keown]</b> One of the main problems for Arsenal at Stoke last week was that Mesut Ozil did not want to close down with the other forwards. It is very easy for Ozil to just try to be creative. If you are never pressing, you do not have to rebalance yourself when you get in possession. Sanchez does both sides of the game very well. Arsenal need that in their team - and Sanchez will be urging Ozil to press with him. Alexandre Lacazette and Sanchez will run off the ball for Ozil when he has the ball and they need him to do the same for them.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal proved against Chelsea that they do not need contract rebels Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez]</b> There has been so much fear at Arsenal of losing Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil. This excellent performance at Chelsea without them made you wonder what all the fuss was about. Without these two, Arsenal were much better defensively. They were disciplined, worked together and pressed as a unit to close down Chelsea.<br /><br />This was the first time that Chelsea have failed to score at Stamford Bridge under Antonio Conte. When Chelsea were in possession, Arsenal put them under such pressure they made Gary Cahill look like he could not pass. How many times do you see Sanchez flying forward to press and no one coming to join him? Arsene Wenger has not been brave enough to leave out Ozil but how much does he offer the team? With midfielders working around him, Aaron Ramsey was able to get on the ball more. He ran the show in midfield and it was his best display for years. For this Arsenal team, it was a chance to step up and prove that they did not need Sanchez and Ozil to perform</p>

I think it’s a huge story that Ozil doesn’t play tonight. If you look at their pre-seasons, Ozil wasn’t in the German squad in the summer, he came back on the very first day of pre-season, and didn’t then start the season, there was a bit of suspicion around him. Last year he went missing for a couple of months and I think that’s his tactic in terms of getting away from the football club. I don’t know, but I have a feeling that he’s going to take his reliability away from selection.</p>

There is no room in the calendar to jet off to concerts. At the end of the season you get four weeks off and that is the time to cram in what you want to do. In a way it is selfish that he should choose to go to Holland just before this huge match. It feels unprofessional. Aguero may not have broken City’s code of conduct but there are still professional boundaries he needs to adhere to.<br /><br />Guardiola is without a key member of his attacking weaponry and the fans will be denied a chance to see a star player in a box-office clash. I would not be surprised if Guardiola curtails the number of days off he gives his players from now on</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has questioned Mesut Ozil’s commitment to the club]</b> I think he’s testing Wenger more than any other player has. I think it was Belarus the other week, he didn’t fancy going. He didn’t want to go. Suddenly he was injured again, he played nine minutes against West Bromwich Albion on the Monday, so how did he get injured there? I think in some departments he’s already left. Psychologically, mentally, he’s already left the football club. Maybe Wenger is now trying to do the best deal he can to get some compensation for him.<br /><br />I think he doesn’t want that sort of player around the youngsters in the group. They played exceptionally well at Chelsea, where Iwobi did a really manful job - I know he hasn’t got the talent of Ozil, of course, but suddenly Arsenal could compete in both departments defensively and attacking-wise. It was probably the best performance I’ve seen in a couple of years.<br /><br />I was really impressed and it seemed like every player was giving their best. Alexis Sanchez is different. He loves playing football, just give him a ball and he’ll play and that’s all he wants to do. But Ozil, I think he’s downed tools, he wants to go and it’s going to get messy</p>

Is he really bothered? He’s just missed a chance to win a game for Arsenal.<br /><br />Everything that happens afterwards wouldn’t have happened. I don’t know if he cares enough or not but he’s certainly not ruthless enough. He had a gilt-edged opportunity to wrap up proceedings today and he didn’t take it. There’s only one outcome here. When it comes to January surely Mesut Ozil will be gone. I’d keep <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez through to the end of the season because surely he is their best chance of getting into the Champions League<br /><br />He’s a great talent, there is no doubt, but where is his head right now?

They are wiping the floor with the rest of the Premier League, but Pep Guardiola’s quest for greatness in Europe could prevent City from matching our feat. City are certainly developing an invincible aura. They are winning matches in the tunnel. Every emphatic victory adds a layer of superiority that causes opponents to melt when they line up before a game.<br /><br />In our unbeaten league season, we were knocked out in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the quarter-finals of the Champions League. City rode their luck against Napoli last week. To fight on all fronts, you have to keep key players fit. How would City cope without Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings in midfield? What City are doing now is breathtaking. They have the calibre to become the next Invincibles, but there is still a long race to be run.</p>

Any doubts about Arsenal’s record signing were erased when he came on and scored<br /><br />Arsene Wenger’s game plan was to stop Manchester City playing and for periods, it worked. But where was Arsenal’s midfield creativity? They were not able to play the way they wanted in the final third and that is where Wilshere would have made a difference. He commits defenders, he creates space, he finds that pass for Alexis Sanchez or Alexandre Lacazette. Sanchez and Mesut Ozil did not have good games. If they are not going to sign contracts, then Arsenal have to start looking to the future. Does Wenger play Wilshere instead of Ozil, or in midfield in place of Granit Xhaka?</p>

To keep hold of this promising side and prove that a shift in power has taken place, Tottenham need to start winning trophies.<br /><br />Harry Kane and Dele Alli are as valuable to Tottenham now but if Mauricio Pochettino does not start winning trophies, he risks a similar break-up of his side. After the departures of Anelka, Overmars and Petit, we were able to rebuild and win the Double in 2002 but there is no guarantee Pochettino would be able to do the same</p>

There is little use selling them in January for a reduced fee only to strengthen a rival.

Wenger will focus on what Mkhitaryan can do. The player will be coming in with a point to prove. Mourinho does not always get it right with players. Look at Kevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah. They have been two of the best players in the Premier League this season and both were let go by Mourinho at Chelsea. Mkhitaryan is coming in with a point to prove and if he can make it work, this will have been a successful transfer window for Wenger.<br /><br />Arsenal have lost a top player in Alexis Sanchez. But the uncertainty surrounding the futures of Sanchez and Mesut Ozil has created a negativity around the club. Arsenal have had two years of uncertainty over whether Arsene Wenger will stay, and now it has been the same with these two players. I do not see this happening at other clubs. This week, Manchester City quickly tied Kevin De Bruyne down to a new, five-year deal. If Sanchez had clearly made up his mind that he wanted to leave long ago, why did the decision makers at the top of the club not realise that sooner? In the summer, Arsenal could have got £60 million for Sanchez. The arrival of Henrikh Mkhitaryan now has at least allowed them to get something from the deal. While I hope we are proved wrong, I think Ozil will leave this summer. It feels like Arsenal have been dictated to by these players for too long. In the future, this situation cannot be allowed to happen again at Arsenal. I feel sorry for the other players in the dressing room who have had to deal with this going on around them</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil’s new contract will feel like a new signing]</b> It is great news for Arsenal. For the fans, it will almost feel like another new signing. Arsenal are in their lowest league position since negotiations with Ozil began and this could be a massive show of loyalty from the player. Arsenal need him more than ever - and to keep him happy Arsene Wenger is going to have to buy the right players in the summer. There seems to have been a speeding up in decision making when it has come to letting players go that we have not been sure about. Arsenal fans will be anxious to see who the replacements are going to be. Wenger still has to get that central defensive partnership right - and the team have to learn how to stay in a game away from home.<br /><br />Since the start of season, Arsenal have let a number of players go: Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and now Theo Walcott, Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud. Those players were not consistent enough for Arsenal and, by signing a player like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Arsene Wenger has shown he wants to go for proven quality and consistency. It is vital that these players work for Arsenal. I am not sure how much stronger the Arsenal squad is following this window, but it signals the beginning of the change at the club.<br /><br />I said last week that Arsenal need to go big in the summer and maybe the arrivals of Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan will be like Vieira and Anelka in 1996-1997 before Wenger went out and bought more ahead of the Double-winning campaign. This has been a rescue window for Arsenal. They could have lost Alexis Sanchez for nothing at the end of the season but they were able to get Henrikh Mkhitaryan in a swap deal before spending big on another player. The signing of Aubameyang will relieve some of the pressure on Wenger from the fans. The aim will be for these players to rescue Arsenal’s season by winning the Europa League</p>

I was part of the Arsenal side who finished a point behind United that year. That Gunners team was one of the best I played in, but United beat us in an FA Cup semi-final replay despite being reduced to 10 men, thanks to a moment of magic from Ryan Giggs. United always had one player who would do something special to dig out unexpected results. Where United were so strong was with four strikers all competing to be top dog. Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke would run the legs off you, then Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would come off the bench with a point to prove. And their finest hour in the Champions League final was delivered by those two substitutes. Peter Schmeichel was one of the Premier League’s finest keepers. He was such a daunting figure for strikers. The years he spent at the top should be a blueprint for Ederson at Manchester City<br /><br />City can be as dominant as the great Liverpool and United sides but winning trophies gives teams an extra layer of armour.

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger has one more Premier League meeting with Jose Mourinho to come]</b> Jose Mourinho became Arsene Wenger’s next big adversary and Wenger came off worse in that head-to-head. Mourinho coming in and winning those two Premier Leagues in 2005 and 2006 ultimately brought about the beginning of the end of Wenger’s supremacy in English football. His timing was perfect. He arrived at Chelsea with plenty of resources at his disposal and built a brilliant team. Arsenal finished second in 2005 and without the rise of Chelsea, Wenger probably would have won another Premier League title. I am sure both men will be eager to get one last victory over the other this weekend.<br /><br />The new manager will have to do the opposite of what Wenger did when he arrived in 1996. When Wenger arrived, he found a club where the emphasis was on limiting the opposition. The training sessions were very defensive and it was a case of ‘1-0 to the Arsenal’. It was all repetitive work on the training ground to the extent that you became bored with it. Wenger came in and made us much more creative. It was like a breath of fresh air. It felt like we had all become complete footballers. While Wenger’s emphasis is to play football, it feels as if some of the basics are no longer there in the defenders. When I returned to Arsenal in 1993, it was all about the defensive line. If you were involved in a situation to clear a ball, you had to recover and get back in that line. Laurent Koscielny has been at the club for a long time and Arsenal’s defenders should be taking their line off him. He should know where he needs to be and where the line needs to be but at times I do not think he does. While there are still negotiations to be done with certain players, the new manager will inherit good attacking players in Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mesut Ozil, Alexandre Lacazette. What he needs to do is work with the defence and the protection it gets</p>

He is physical, quick and against Burnley did not look ruffled in possession. I saw a real warmth from the Arsenal fans for a player who was showing fight. When you play this way, you have to make sure you do not go below the line. Ultimately, you have to stay on the pitch. Mavropanos is only 20. It is massive for him to break into the Arsenal first team at his age. I was a similar age when I was first sent off - for Arsenal at Manchester City in 1986. I played in an aggressive way from the start of my career and if you get it wrong, you are off. It is massive for Mavropanos that he has broken into the first team. There is a contingent of young defenders at the club now, with Calum Chambers and Rob Holding. Arsenal have lost two central defenders with Per Mertesacker retiring and Laurent Koscielny out until December. The new manager needs to assess whether the young defenders are good enough and maintain a pathway for those who are. Arsenal need a top level central defender for one of these youngsters to play alongside.</p>

Emery needs to bring in a player like Marco Verratti, who he managed at Paris Saint-Germain, to instil those qualities in midfield.<br /><br />I would love to see a former Arsenal player in charge but appointing Patrick Vieira or Mikel Arteta would have been a huge leap of faith given neither has managed in Europe. <b>[Ivan]</b> Gazidis was also impressed by Emery’s analysis of every player and I am intrigued to see how he tries to cure Arsenal’s defensive ills</p>

When England are going forward, that player could have six players in front of him: Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard and the two wing backs. It is vital the pivot sits deep to give England numbers in defence to deal with a counter-attack. Henderson likes to get forward but if he does in this system, England could be left with just three players in defence. Dier is better suited to this role but his leg has been strapped up this week which may count against him. Southgate may want to go with the player he can rely upon to be fit.

  <p><b>[Martin Keown has back Mesut Ozil to recapture his best form under Unai Emery]</b> I am hoping that now he is not playing international football that it can benefit Arsenal. They can get him back focused completely and Emery is the manager to do that. There’s messages coming out that he came back early to training and that’s the right attitude. It looks as if he is enjoying his football more. It looks as if the fun had gone out of his game, he needs to get back to enjoying it. Enjoying creating those opportunities. I think he can do it again. I know he is a quality player. What’s in question sometimes is his commitment. Is that a body language thing? Is that just him himself? Only he will know that, but he has still got a lot to prove and I hope he comes through in the Arsenal shirt. He won’t play for Germany again so it seems, but when he plays for Arsenal, let’s see the performances that we know are there. We will have to wait and see what the player wants. You always have to keep re-achieving, you are always on trial. Yes, of course, what you achieve is what you are judged on. You are only as good as your last game really. He needs to set the example. He is a senior figure there and there is no doubt that Emery is going to give him the reins. Let’s see how the performances come. He needs to start well and he is in the position to control games.<br /><br />It is strange, what you want at every football club is stability, and that’s what Arsenal have quite remarkably had. It is the start of a new chapter in Arsenal’s history. It is about the next generation coming in and making their mark at the club. You talk about Ozil being that person and if I was a young player there now, I would be licking my lips at the opportunity to, not turn the club around, but take it to the next level. he structure is there for Arsenal to be successful; a great fan base, great stadium, great group of players and they just need to get to boiling point and find the right system that they need to gel together. They played with a four and a three last year and conceded far too many goals. Their away performances last year simply weren’t good enough but it is there and I think it is mouthwatering for the Arsenal fans. Emery must be really pleased that he made that move to come to Arsenal because it is a great opportunity for him. I am not on the inside, but perhaps, when you look at Arsene Wenger, when he arrived he had a back four and goalkeeper of outstanding quality. The new manager Emery has pretty much the opposite. I think he has a lot of options at the top of the pitch. <b>[Pierre Emerick]</b> Aubameyang, <b>[Henrikh]</b> Mkhitaryan, Ozil, <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette. These are good players and it is now about bringing these players back. I think the players are going to have to be on their toes and wanting to do well. The Arsenal fans, I think, are hopeful that it will be a good season<br /><br />The pre-season results have been excellent. What they did to PSG set a good benchmark for them. I think in the first game of the season, there could be an upset. They play Man City, Aubameyang is in fine form and they have had that good balance. They are all together and that’s an advantage, whereas City, they are still not all back together and have not been training <b>[for very long]</b>. So Arsenal could steal a march on them, but if Arsenal make it into the top four then I think that would be a very good return<br /><br />I don’t quite expect that to happen this season, Manchester United might be the ones who find it the most difficult to try to stay there. Chelsea and Arsenal will put pressure on Manchester United for that fourth place. All I am looking at is the first game of the season and the energy that will be created in the Emirates Stadium. The Emirates was sold as the new promised land but it didn’t quite happen, in terms of the Premier League, but now it is a new beginning. It was a difficult place to play games for Arsenal last year at times. The energy now, if it is turned in the right direction, Arsenal could become a big force and it could be too much for Man City on their opening day. It is a mouthwatering fixture and it is surely one that Man City wouldn’t have wanted.</p>

We took him to the 2014 World Cup with a view to developing him into England’s first-choice left-back for 2018 but that did not materialise. I first watched him as a 16-year-old playing on a training pitch for Southampton against Reading. In the first 10 seconds, he whipped a ball across the box with such power and precision that I just thought, ‘Wow’. I was standing next to an Arsenal scout and I immediately said, ‘You’ve got to sign him’. Rarely had I seen a 16-year-old play with such certainty. In recent years he lost that from his game but it is coming back. This summer Jose Mourinho has given him his support and as a result Shaw has flourished.

He brings that little bit of tenacity to the midfield and is more mobile. Uses the ball well; distributes it nice and calmly. He puts his foot in and I think Arsenal fans were up off their seats today to see that. That’s what they need in that midfield.<br /><br />Xhaka often over-commits and makes the foul. Torreira can actually get to the ball and make those tackles. He’ll grow in confidence now and I see him being an integral part of that Arsenal midfield</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery’s dynamic demeanour is seeing more demanded from Arsenal]</b> One of Arsene Wenger’s 10 commandments was to never bark orders at his players from the sidelines. His view was that when players had the ball, that was their moment to shine. He did not want to overload them with information. It is why Unai Emery’s dynamic demeanour - which was in full flow against Watford - will have come as a shock to the Arsenal players. In the first few weeks of the season, they seemed to be taking their manager’s instructions too literally. Now, they are feeding off his energy. By being so animated, Emery is showing the desire, passion and work ethic he wants from his players. Wenger’s approach from the touchline was one of nurture. His successor is more demanding.</p>

When the ball was in and around the box, I saw opportunities for Arsenal defenders to put a foot in but no-one really took charge. I look at the three centre halves - Sokratis, Shkodran Mustafi and Rob Holding, who is now injured -and think: ‘Which one is going to develop into the leader?’ I know Ander Herrera was offside for Manchester United’s first equaliser but the Arsenal players were looking at one another wondering who was going to clear the ball. When I played in the Arsenal back four, the other three were constantly questioning me and I was asking the same of them. We would nit-pick the whole time. It was easy for me to come into that back four. The defenders were all snarling and desperate to win. These are the qualities that Arsenal’s current defence must develop.</p>

Not only will he be desperate to prove a point to the Arsenal fans, but Sanchez gets a real buzz from playing in this competition.<br /><br />He has scored in two FA Cup final victories with Arsenal and found the net in three semi-finals - including for United against Tottenham last season. He could cause Arsenal serious problems down their left flank. Sead Kolasinac plays as more of a wing-back than a defender, often leaving gaping holes behind him.

Both sides have kept just four clean sheets in their 23 Premier League games, so this could well be a high-scoring game.

He wanted that away goal. It was the first time those two had started together in an away game since against Manchester City in February. It was brave from the Arsenal boss, but it paid off. This was a professional performance from the Premier League side, and the free-kick from Lacazette was a piece of quality. The Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret helped him out greatly by taking a step to his right but it was still a fine finish.<br /><br />One downside from this trip was the loss of Aaron Ramsey to what appeared to be a hamstring issue. The Wales international was outstanding in the first leg. He put in the hard work and pulled the strings at the Emirates Stadium. Considering he is heading for Juventus, putting in a good performance against Napoli is not a bad way to endear yourself to your new Italian fans. He did that before he went off 34 minutes into this tie. Ramsey has always had the right attitude, even when he has been out of the team. He is a role model for the young players at Arsenal.

Emery can help his players by settling on a system. He keeps switching between a back three and a back four and that cannot help the side develop any consistency.

Maybe Emery thinks he can control the Brazilian - they crossed paths at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> - but him missing first-team training with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on Wednesday is a red flag.

United kept two clean sheets in 19 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> outings at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> last season.

This is really going to divide the fans. There are times when <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> goes missing in midfield, he’s given penalties away … he must be an incredible character off the pitch! It’s surprising, particularly how he was booed off the pitch less than a week ago. It’s a brave decision by the manager, he’s picked him every time he’s available so he clearly believes in the player, but I’m surprised, I must say.<br /><br />You need to be sure the captain is going to be in the team and he’s on borrowed time.

I was just reading the statistics about the number of shots the opposition have had at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s goal this season, the number of unforced errors - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are the top of all these lists, and it’s because Emery is not getting the balance right with his team.

The players want him, but it’s interesting the manager couldn’t see that for himself and he needed to throw it to the players. We have to respect that, but really it’s about the performance on the pitch and I want more from him in midfield. I don’t want silly, crazy tackles, I want him to sit in front of the defence, I want to be picking out those diagonal passes, I want to see him talking to players, cajoling players and in their ears. I want to see those leadership skills on the pitch, not just in the dressing room. I haven’t seen that so far.

That should make it an easy interview for most managers, because it is quite obvious - strengthen the centre of defence and midfield and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can be a real force in the Premier League<br /><br />If it is going to happen, it is not just down to him - there is going to have to be a shift in mentality from the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players. By that - and I am obviously speaking as an ex-defender here - I mean a realisation by the players of what is required when they are not in possession, and also a willingness to actually go and do it too. There is no magic wand, and there is a reason a lot of what we have seen from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> so far this season, we saw again on Sunday</p>

We haven’t got the original difficult to beat or the expressive, creative, artistic <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. We’ve got to get one or the other back. Freddie has tried to be creative, but we’re not staying in games long enough to be able to play that way<br /><br /><b>[Keown went on to highlight <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defensive fragility]</b> <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a> met me the other day and he said, ‘I still go to bed at night hearing your voice ringing in my ears, because you kept saying, sit here!

There is no defensive compass whatsoever in this side and their defence is getting no protection whatsoever from the midfield. They’re either all the way back sitting in close to the defence or they’re all the way up and the opposition is in behind you. I never see an argument with the midfielders and defenders saying, ‘where are you’, ‘push up behind me’, or vice versa</p>

You could argue with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> that’s what happened because at the time <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> were two big players and they didn’t want to lose both so they invested heavily in <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>. They need to strengthen the spine of the team. The midfield will need to be improved and so does the defence, the results tell you that. It’s about what sort of resources <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will be given and where he feels he needs to prioritise.<br /><br />I feel he needs to build from the back. All the successful <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> teams have had a really strong defence and although you can improve things on the training pitch, I think he has to start with personnel. You want dominant figures, people who want to organise and win that ball when it comes into the box. So that has to be an area where he wants to strengthen or change who he wants to start with. I imagine now they are spending a lot of time watching players across the world trying to denitrify individuals that they can bring in for really good value. But <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won’t be able to shop in the most expensive shops I’m afraid. They will have to look for players who are slightly down from that, which has an element of risk. It’s about a judgement call on your players. Very good players have been bought in the past that nobody really knew anything about. They are going to have to be imaginative in the transfer market. There is a hell of a competition amongst all the top teams to try to find these individuals and it’s a judgement call and in the end I think <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will be judged obviously by results, but also in the transfer market</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown has expressed his belief that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> centre-back <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> has to go this summer]</b> <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> concerns me because if you’re going to pay £8m for him and give him £5m wages and he’s only going to be there for one season, I’m not sure about the wisdom of that. Is he a proper defender? Can he play in a back four? His best defending came when he was in a back three at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when they won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> <b>[in 2016-17]</b>. It’s the most crucial area which he <b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>]</b> has to get right. Holding’s been injured, it’s hard to judge him, he probably deserves another opportunity. I think that Sokratis could be a useful defender but I can understand the uncertainty of giving <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> a new deal. Do they now start to be harsh and make those key decisions? If <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> isn’t the answer, then he has to go now. He doesn’t enjoy being in wide positions in the back four, he tends to bring people down and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a>, although <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has got a bit of a tune out of him, we know <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> isn’t quite at the level as well. You go to a football club, you have to make your mark and if it doesn’t happen you have to hold your hands up. I think both players will have to do that… I can’t see that being a long-term partnership in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defence.<br /><br />There’s an awful lot of work to be done in there. There was the defender from Saint-Etienne, <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a>, who they paid £27 million for but was loaned back again. I couldn’t quite work that out because now I’m being told he’s world-class. Never mind if he’s world-class, if he was <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> class it would have been good enough because that was an area of concern</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown says <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> nearest thing to Henry but can’t be captain]</b> I don’t think he will. I think he’ll leave with a heavy heart. I think he’s the nearest thing I have seen to <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> at the football club and the club will have to make swift decisions. They can’t allow what happened a few years ago with the transfers just going on and on. The club needs direction<br /><br />It’s a real concern for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, recently with <b>[Mesut]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, they lost <b>[Aaron]</b> Ramsey, they lost <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez. We’re hearing now that, unlike <b>[Unai]</b> Emery who wasn’t involved apparently in the Ramsey situation, him leaving, he’s <b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> getting involved. I think the message needs to be to the player ‘look, we can’t have you captaining the club if there’s uncertainty around your contract’, in the last year of his contract, that can’t be allowed to happen. Whether you keep him, whether you don’t, that all depends on the monetary side. What are they going to get? What are the offers? Because they do need to look at it and what it means to them to break into the Champions League, to maybe challenge for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. So if they’re only going to get an offer of £20m-£30m then you have to consider whether you’re going to keep him there or not and whether the player has got the mental capacity to stay, but he can’t be captain because the message is the wrong one to the rest of the group. So there’s lots of building for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> to do.</p>

In fact, I advised him to do that at the time. What we have seen with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> - for one reason or another, and everyone feels you’re picking on him - he’s a player that isn’t part of the future at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

I think there’s enough favour there for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> as a young manager to maybe get away with this one. Nonetheless, I think he should be making the right decisions for the football club and I don’t believe <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is the right man to be in that dressing room. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> took a different view when he took over at Chelsea; he wanted <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> out of his dressing room, for whatever reason, whether that was performance or character, I’m not sure, but he made that clear decision<br /><br />Now, I think <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is very lucky to be there back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for another year. But then I worry about the manager, because you only get so long in this job and you’ve got to make the right decisions, and the early decisions have to be right. That is a huge problem, that position; <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> has given the most penalties away this season, four, he’s not mobile enough, he goes to ground too early <b>[…]</b> As former players we don’t enjoy ridiculing and hammering players, and he’s had a fine career, but he’s only ever done it in a back-three<br /><br />So unless it is that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is going to change to a back-three and he’s going to play in the middle, as he did at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when he won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in real trouble. Because he’s going to be exposed, he’s going to make rash challenges, and actually in possession he’s been really disappointing. He’s often going back to the goalkeeper and inviting pressure from the opposition. So this is massive for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> now. He’s got to go looking for central defenders, there’s injuries in that position, <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> isn’t the answer and he’s getting another year’s contract!</p>
