  <p><b>[Martin Keown says Philippe Coutinho would be a very exciting signing for Arsenal]</b> It’s a shame to think that it is far-fetched when they could have been real possibilities. I would love to see him at Arsenal without a doubt, he is a great talent who has lost his way a bit but I think it is too much to hope for that he ends up at Arsenal. He’s a top quality player, the way he breaks from deep-lying midfield positions, his shooting ability - it’s a mystery why it hasn’t gone well for him at Barcelona. It would be a very exciting signing<br /><br /><b>[Emery – despite much talk of a move for Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney – is set to head into the 2019-20 campaign with a defensive unit that has drawn plenty of criticism in the past]</b> He must think he can do it tactically with the players he has. Otherwise it’s very obvious that he should have been buying central defenders, or defensively minded individuals both in midfield and at the back. So he has made decisions in regards to the personalities he wants and he’s gone after and pursed this talent, so that’s a gamble because we know there is a weakness and only time will tell if he’s got that right</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown says David Luiz is not Arsenal’s answer to their prayers]</b> Yes, Arsenal want a centre back, but is Luiz the answer to their prayers? I don’t think so. The way the 32-year-old plays, he would be exposed in that Arsenal defence. He would not get the same protection that he enjoys at Chelsea, where N’Golo Kante patrols in front of the back line. In possession, Luiz is a wonderful passer, but he makes mistakes when playing as part of a back four. He has a tendency to lose his marker and is one of those all-or-nothing players - if he doesn’t win the ball in a challenge, then congratulations because you’re in. <br /><br />Luiz is clearly a big personality. Maybe Emery thinks he can control the Brazilian - they crossed paths at Paris Saint-Germain - but him missing first-team training with Chelsea on Wednesday is a red flag. Let’s not forget that Arsenal have just been forced to sell a player to Bordeaux who did this to them. Laurent Koscielny was club captain and always came across as a good egg, but he still made sure he got his move. He refused to take part in their pre-season tour of the United States. That proved how even the most well-balanced player is prepared to rock the boat in a bid to get his way. Do Arsenal really want to be on the receiving end of someone willing to kick up a similar fuss now? That’s why I question whether he (Luiz) would be suitable for Unai Emery.</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown says Harry Maguire reads danger like you or I read a Beano comic!]</b> Harry Maguire reads danger like you or I would read a Beano comic. It comes naturally to the 6’4 central defender and that is what Manchester United have paid good money for. When he wins the ball, it is a cue for United to attack. Take a look at their second goal against Chelsea on Sunday. The England centre-back wins possession by shrugging off the challenge of Tammy Abraham on the edge of the box. Scott McTominay picks it up, feeds Marcus Rashford, who then finds Andreas Pereira. He crosses, and Anthony Martial scores. So four passes and precisely 16 seconds after Maguire steals the ball off Abraham, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have a 2-0 lead. United fans appreciate a good defender.<br /><br />Later on in the game, whenever Maguire won a header, whenever he cleared the danger by lumping the ball into Row Z, it was greeted by cheers. They love seeing that and the statistics show he made the most clearances, the most interceptions, and the most blocks. He inspired the crowd and his team-mates here. United kept two clean sheets in 19 Premier League outings at Old Trafford last season. They conceded 54 goals in total – the most of any of the ‘Big Six’ – and 25 of those came at home. Now, they are off and running in 2019-20<br /><br /><b>[Keown added on Maguire, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence in recent years]</b> I know of big clubs who were tracking the 26-year-old back when he was just a teenager breaking into the first team at Sheffield United. I was surprised when he went to Hull for only £2.5m in 2014. He had potential but none of the big boys in the Premier League took a chance at the time. Now, after paying £80m, Manchester United have him. This was a very good day for Maguire and Solskjaer’s new signings</p>

  <p><b>[The former Gunners defender believes <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> may have made a mistake in allowing an inconsistent and temperamental figure such as <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> to take the armband]</b> This is a massive call and I think perhaps he <b>[Emery]</b> has got it wrong. This is really going to divide the fans. There are times when <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> goes missing in midfield, he’s given penalties away … he must be an incredible character off the pitch! It’s surprising, particularly how he was booed off the pitch less than a week ago. It’s a brave decision by the manager, he’s picked him every time he’s available so he clearly believes in the player, but I’m surprised, I must say.<br /><br />You need to be sure the captain is going to be in the team and he’s on borrowed time. There are others in that group, <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a>, <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a>, <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a>, who are starting to progress, so if <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> is still going to be a permanent fixture than I’m surprised by that. I would have gone for <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, he would have been a pretty good fit. It might have given him a little more extra responsibility. He’s doing fantastically well at the moment and he’s secure in the team, he’s a regular.<br /><br />It’s a bold move from Emery and he better get it right. I was just reading the statistics about the number of shots the opposition have had at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s goal this season, the number of unforced errors – <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are the top of all these lists, and it’s because Emery is not getting the balance right with his team. He’s been in the job a year now and things are going to have to improve away from home. It’s a massive test on Monday <b>[against Manchester United]</b>. If you get results, everybody stands by the decisions, but this is a massive call and I think perhaps he’s got it wrong.<br /><br />Within that dressing room, clearly, obviously, he’s a leader because that’s why they voted for him. The players want him, but it’s interesting the manager couldn’t see that for himself and he needed to throw it to the players. We have to respect that, but really it’s about the performance on the pitch and I want more from him in midfield. I don’t want silly, crazy tackles, I want him to sit in front of the defence, I want to be picking out those diagonal passes, I want to see him talking to players, cajoling players and in their ears. I want to see those leadership skills on the pitch, not just in the dressing room. I haven’t seen that so far. The vote on confidence, the actual armband, can do big things for you, so I hope it does that for his game.</p>

The moment Saka picked up the ball after a misplaced pass by <a href="axel-tuanzebe.html">Axel Tuanzebe</a> in the 58th minute, he did not hesitate.

Then they can be creative and this is what <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are good at. They’ve got that creativity, they’re well probed. They’re all on the front foot, ready to break. But in the second half they seemed to switch off. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, you are scoring the goals but you need to work harder.

Maybe <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> should push in a bit closer.

  <p><b>[Martin Keown claims The problems at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are obvious]</b> There has been lots of speculation about who <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> want as their next permanent manager but I am not really bothered specifically who that person is, more about the set of values and qualities that they will bring. I want someone with charisma. A good communicator and a motivator, who can bring the right balance to their style of play. Above all, though, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need a winner. Someone with a long-term vision for the club, and the ability to see that vision through.<br /><br />So it is a bit concerning that there does not appear to be a clear plan in the type of manager that the board wants - you only have to look at the very different profiles of all the names being mentioned to see that. That kind of fits in with the recent issues there have been in the boardroom, and the different directions people in different positions at the club seem to want to go in. I am not sure who will decide who the next manager is, but hopefully part of the interview process will be to ask any candidates what sort of changes they would make to the team. That should make it an easy interview for most managers, because it is quite obvious - strengthen the centre of defence and midfield and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can be a real force in the Premier League<br /><br />If it is going to happen, it is not just down to him - there is going to have to be a shift in mentality from the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players. By that - and I am obviously speaking as an ex-defender here - I mean a realisation by the players of what is required when they are not in possession, and also a willingness to actually go and do it too. There is no magic wand, and there is a reason a lot of what we have seen from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> so far this season, we saw again on Sunday</p>

Such a poor game for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. If you break down the performance you could have looked at every single player and say that they could have all done more. <b>[Nicolas]</b> Pepe is going to have to improve. <b>[Gabriel]</b> <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> should have come on a lot earlier. <b>[Granit]</b> <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> was taking the easy way out. A lot of players were not playing their best<br /><br />It would have been the perfect way to finish but they didn’t. There was a lot of anger, fans were showing their anger at the end of the game. There is going to be a lot of fallout from this game</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> needs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> board to make money available in the summer]</b> I do feel that, you know, I said he was a rookie manager, a rookie manager can win as well. It’s new for him. I think he will weed through the problems. He’s an intelligent man. But it brings it closer doesn’t it? I think a disappointment like that <b>[losing to <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> in Europe]</b> doesn’t paper over the cracks, he’ll be able to work out far sooner what changes need to be made<br /><br />The set-piece situation is really a catastrophe at the moment. The last two games they’ve conceded four goals from four corners. So you know, it’s not rocket science to sort out where the problems are. He’ll have to go into the transfer market one assumes and I just hope that the board support him because some money is going to have to be spent. And we need, of course, to hold on to <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> although he missed that glorious opportunity to be the hero again. I think it’s hard to come for him. He’s been <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s best player for the last two or three years and we need him to get back and hope it doesn’t impact too much psychologically on the team because we have an FA Cup game coming up on Monday, and still the chance to make it into the Champions League, although it’s an outside chance</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Keown believes <a href="pablo-mari.html">Pablo Mari</a> must be given more opportunities following his impressive <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> debut]</b> He didn’t have a lot to do apart from his distribution. But he won everything when necessary. You could see that he was a little bit short of fitness and that they are building him up. He looks to have the basis of a good player there. There were important first steps on Monday night, even though he wasn’t tested that much because in the second half <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> completely dominated possession - it was a bit of a football lesson for Portsmouth<br /><br />I think he looked very solid, he has the height in inches. You look at the stature of the player and he won everything in the air. He wasn’t rapid, but was quick enough to deal with all the situations. We were playing against a League One side who had a lone striker so he and <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> were able to boss him between the two of them. I think it was important that he had Luiz alongside him to talk him through the game. Now we have to give him time, he has to be given more opportunities<br /><br />In fairness to the player <b>[Mustafi]</b> I do think that he has shown a lot of character and personality in coming back into the team because when you make those kind of errors, I sensed a bit of fear around him. So all credit to <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> for giving him another opportunity, but long-term it’s an area where the manager will want to strengthen</p>

He’s got to be given money to develop. Do the owners need to be put some of their own money in? Obviously there are limits to the losses the club can run at, we know that with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in recent weeks and what they’ve gone through, but expenditure needs to be made in the team. Key decisions need to be made <b>[with <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and Lacazette]</b>. A<br /><br />re they going to stay or not? Do <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have to face up to the prospect of perhaps losing <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>? I wouldn’t want to see him go, but they don’t want to be held to ransom either. You could argue with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> that’s what happened because at the time <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> were two big players and they didn’t want to lose both so they invested heavily in <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>. They need to strengthen the spine of the team. The midfield will need to be improved and so does the defence, the results tell you that. It’s about what sort of resources <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will be given and where he feels he needs to prioritise.<br /><br />I feel he needs to build from the back. All the successful <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> teams have had a really strong defence and although you can improve things on the training pitch, I think he has to start with personnel. You want dominant figures, people who want to organise and win that ball when it comes into the box. So that has to be an area where he wants to strengthen or change who he wants to start with. I imagine now they are spending a lot of time watching players across the world trying to denitrify individuals that they can bring in for really good value. But <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won’t be able to shop in the most expensive shops I’m afraid. They will have to look for players who are slightly down from that, which has an element of risk. It’s about a judgement call on your players. Very good players have been bought in the past that nobody really knew anything about. They are going to have to be imaginative in the transfer market. There is a hell of a competition amongst all the top teams to try to find these individuals and it’s a judgement call and in the end I think <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will be judged obviously by results, but also in the transfer market</p>

Is he a proper defender? Can he play in a back four? His best defending came when he was in a back three at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when they won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> <b>[in 2016-17]</b>. It’s the most crucial area which he <b>[Mikel Arteta]</b> has to get right. Holding’s been injured, it’s hard to judge him, he probably deserves another opportunity. I think that Sokratis could be a useful defender but I can understand the uncertainty of giving <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> a new deal. Do they now start to be harsh and make those key decisions? If <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> isn’t the answer, then he has to go now. He doesn’t enjoy being in wide positions in the back four, he tends to bring people down and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a>, although <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has got a bit of a tune out of him, we know <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> isn’t quite at the level as well. You go to a football club, you have to make your mark and if it doesn’t happen you have to hold your hands up. I think both players will have to do that… I can’t see that being a long-term partnership in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defence.<br /><br />There’s an awful lot of work to be done in there. There was the defender from Saint-Etienne, <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a>, who they paid £27 million for but was loaned back again. I couldn’t quite work that out because now I’m being told he’s world-class. Never mind if he’s world-class, if he was <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> class it would have been good enough because that was an area of concern</p>

They can’t allow what happened a few years ago with the transfers just going on and on.

We’re hearing now that, unlike <b>[Unai]</b> Emery who wasn’t involved apparently in the Ramsey situation, him leaving, he’s <b>[Arteta]</b> getting involved. I think the message needs to be to the player ‘look, we can’t have you captaining the club if there’s uncertainty around your contract’, in the last year of his contract, that can’t be allowed to happen. Whether you keep him, whether you don’t, that all depends on the monetary side. What are they going to get? What are the offers? Because they do need to look at it and what it means to them to break into the Champions League, to maybe challenge for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. So if they’re only going to get an offer of £20m-£30m then you have to consider whether you’re going to keep him there or not and whether the player has got the mental capacity to stay, but he can’t be captain because the message is the wrong one to the rest of the group. So there’s lots of building for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> to do.</p>

I think there’s enough favour there for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> as a young manager to maybe get away with this one. Nonetheless, I think he should be making the right decisions for the football club and I don’t believe <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is the right man to be in that dressing room. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> took a different view when he took over at Chelsea; he wanted <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> out of his dressing room, for whatever reason, whether that was performance or character, I’m not sure, but he made that clear decision<br /><br />Now, I think <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is very lucky to be there back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for another year.

That is a huge problem, that position; <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> has given the most penalties away this season, four, he’s not mobile enough, he goes to ground too early <b>[…]</b> As former players we don’t enjoy ridiculing and hammering players, and he’s had a fine career, but he’s only ever done it in a back-three<br /><br />So unless it is that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is going to change to a back-three and he’s going to play in the middle, as he did at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when he won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in real trouble. Because he’s going to be exposed, he’s going to make rash challenges, and actually in possession he’s been really disappointing.

He’s got to go looking for central defenders, there’s injuries in that position, <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> isn’t the answer and he’s getting another year’s contract!</p>
