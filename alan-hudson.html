  <p><b>[Blues legend Alan Hudson says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will be getting an Ian Rush-esque frontman in Timo Werner]</b> I like the look of him. They are the two managers, Jurgen <b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> and Frank, that he would have suited perfectly as they both give you license to do what you do best, and we can see what he does best - exactly what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are lacking. He is so positive. He is sharp and you can see he’s hungry for goals and I like the way he makes his own chances whereas many strikers if they don’t get the service struggle. He ‘wins it back’, which reminds me of <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a> who dispossessed opponents if they dilly-dallied on the ball. I don’t think you need to be a good judge to know that this lad has all the ingredients to become a top scorer, and his composure will be a lesson for those at the Bridge who lack that. They have some useful players in and around the box, but, as Frank said regularly, they don’t compose themselves in great scoring situations. I think he’ll be a great signing - and players like him fit into any team that want to attack, and the only team outside of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would have been <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> because their manager loves players like this</p>
