  <p><b>[Head coach Alan Koch admitted his side is still interested after pushing to sign USMNT’s Fabian Johnson over the summer]</b> We definitely have interest in Fabian. We had interest, we continue to have interest. I think a lot of teams would be very wise to take that approach. We’re definitely exploring all sorts of different things . We have a lot of respect for Fabian. He’s playing for an excellent club in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, obviously having a good season, too. We’ll see. We’re not going to focus on one player, we’ll look at all different guys that we can try and acquire</p>

  <p><b>[Greg Garza is still sidelined with an injury, but Kendall Waston and Nick Hagglund started in central defense and struggled to deal with Seattle’s dynamism, and the combination of Raul Ruidiaz and <a href="jordan-morris.html">Jordan Morris</a> caused them fits]</b> I think at times we gave the ball away way too easily and that’s what allowed Seattle to punish us a few times. The positives are when we’re calm and composed and when we take care of the ball we look like a very good team. We obviously have to stretch those moments and make them longer, but if you make mistakes and give the ball away to a team as quality as Seattle, they’re going to hit you</p>
