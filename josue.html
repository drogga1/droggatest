  <p>[Former Brazil and Wolfsburg midfielder Josue has backed Neymar to return in time for the World Cup and turn in a starring performance] Neymar is a reference when you talk about the Brazil team, we put a lot of confidence in him. I’ll put all my chips on him - no one else can come as close to Messi and Ronaldo. His injury wasn’t far from being a serious one. Everyone’s concerned about how he’ll be when he returns. But we have to be positive<br /><br />I think Brazil, Germany and Spain are favourites but I’ll bet on Brazil winning the World Cup. It’s been a while since we’ve been favourites. The national team now has the confidence of the players and the fans with some great performances. It’s a quick and young team<br /><br />[On Edin Dzeko] He’s a forward who can make a difference. He can finish very well and I have a special fondness for him - I still cheer for him after playing with him for two years<br /><br />[On chances of turning around a 5-2 Champions League semi-final deficit against Liverpool] It’ll be tough for Roma to come back against Liverpool - more difficult than it was against Barcelona - but football is an unbelievable universe. I don’t think it’ll happen again, particularly because Liverpool will have seen what Roma did against Barca and will take precautions</p>
