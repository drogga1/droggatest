  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s style of management is simply too demanding for some players, according to the Portuguese manager’s biographer Manuel Pereira]</b> I’m sure not even Mourinho himself has a clear answer to <b>[what went wrong]</b>. There were difficulties between him and the responsible persons from the beginning. He wanted players he never got. This frustrated him because he did not think he could play for all titles with this team. At the beginning, however, he got along with the players. This was also shown by the success in the Europa League.<br /><br />By the beginning of this season, however, he lost more and more of the support of the locker room until he was no longer acceptable. You see how big his problems with the team were at the end, when you look at how the team plays now under his successor.<br /><br />Mourinho is a trainer for shorter periods. He’s never been in a club for more than two or three years, has success first, and finally gets into a fight because the chemistry inside is not right. That’s just Mourinho. A very ambitious and demanding coach, but for some players after a certain time, too demanding. They will eventually relax and rest. That was also the case in Manchester - and foreseeable for me before the season<br /><br /><b>[Rui Faria’s departure from the club]</b> <b>[Rui Faria]</b> was something like Mourinho’s right hand, Mourinho’s mirror - a footballer who understood Mourinho’s way of working better than anyone else. The separation from him, but also the failed once again transfers were ultimately crucial for Mourinho’s failure.<br /><br /><b>[Pereira was not surprised United ultimately decided to part ways with the manager]</b> It’s still cheaper to fire a coach than a whole team. Those responsible no longer had a choice. The pressure was huge. A club like Manchester United can not settle for sixth or seventh place. Even if teams like Liverpool or City are stronger: A Champions League course should be able to be reached with this squad. Although Mourinho did not get every player he wanted, a lot of money was spent without a reasonable return.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid manager Santiago Solari will feel Mourinho’s breath in the coming months]</b> As long as Florentino Perez Reals is president, this option exists. Perez likes and appreciates Mourinho very much. He considers him the ideal coach and would never have let him go in 2013 if Mourinho had not insisted. Mourinho never had any problems with Perez or those responsible. They are not the best friends in the world, but they get along very well. The door to return to Real is open. The moment just has to be right.<br /><br />Since Solari won the Club World Cup in December, I do not expect an immediate release. But maybe in the summer, who knows. I’m sure there’ll be a lot going on at Real Madrid after this season. Solari will certainly feel Mourinho’s breath in the coming months<br /><br /><b>[When asked about Mourinho’s plans for the next few months]</b> He will not directly take over a club. The most probable thing is that he takes a break until summer to gather the strength needed for a new challenge. He does not have to hurry, but has all the time in the world<br /><br />He is a very ambitious person and will not disappear into the sunset. He still has a long life as a coach before him with many challenges that excite him. He has only trained in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain so far. For example, he still lacks the Bundesliga. If Karl-Heinz Rummenigge calls him tomorrow and offers him to train Bayern, Mourinho would agree for sure. Also PSG would certainly be a delightful task for him<br /><br />In case he does not find a club in the summer, I can imagine that he will take over the Portuguese national team. That would mean less stress for him. He could thereby devote himself more to his private life, which has suffered a lot in Manchester. He did not have a real home there, but spent most nights in the hotel or flew to London to be with his family. But a lot can happen by summer. Especially at Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s biographer Manuel Pereira says that the manager’s issues with Paul Pogba came down to the Portuguese’s desire to control his players]</b> He is certainly not someone who controls the privacy of his players. That is not his right. When it comes to football, he likes to have full control.<br /><br />Mourinho quickly becomes suspicious of players who do not reach their maximum in training and games. This can happen once, twice or three times, but not regularly. He does not want them fooling around, but disciplined and playing football. That’s what they’re paid for. If a player gives 100 per cent, Mourinho has no problem with him. Then there is nothing to control. But when Mourinho feels it is not the case and the player feels he has to do less, it becomes difficult.<br /><br />Most clubs today believe in the professionalism of their players, that they pay attention to themselves and their diet and in the middle of the season do not drink alcohol or go to parties. However, the example of Ousmane Dembele shows well that there are still a few players who struggle with it. At Real Madrid, for example, every player had to be available for a caregiver at midnight in the past. Such rules are inconceivable today. It is even more important for a coach to have someone to represent him on the pitch<br /><br />Exactly. A respect person who communicates the ideas of the trainer to the rest of the team. You could say: A coach among the players. Mourinho always had that before his time in Manchester. For example, Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid, Frank Lampard at Chelsea or Javier Zanetti at Inter Milan. It is always difficult to lead and coordinate a group of 25 men, especially if you are a demanding person like Mourinho. Only a few coaches can do that<br /><br />I remember when Diego Simeone almost always set up Tiago in his early years at Atletico Madrid. Tiago was not a footballer from another planet, but an incredibly strong player, a good communicator who internalised and passed on Simeone’s ideas and ways of thinking. Later, Gabi took over this role, today it’s Diego Godin.<br /><br />At Manchester I don’t see such a leader anymore. There is no Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs or Rio Ferdinand anymore. With such leaders in the team Mourinho would have had it easier</p>
