<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jorg Radek declare banning supporters in the stands is not enough to ensure public safetys]</b> Maybe it is possible to control what is happening in the stadium. This does not apply to the public space in front of it. The stadiums become a potential target for fans who want to support their team<br /><br />That would be devastating. We can’t have large crowds outside the stadium gates. It’s not only forbidden, it would be irresponsible.<br /><br />It becomes relevant to the police at that moment, we then have to ensure that the requirements that currently apply to behavior in public space are complied with: the requirement of a distance of one and a half meters, the ban on the assembly of large groups, the wearing of masks.<br /><br />We will have to intervene in terms of maintaining security and order if this is not guaranteed</p>
