  <p><b>[Phil Jagielka has challenged England’s fringe players to stake a claim for a starting spot when they take on Lithuania]</b> I’m obviously delighted that Roy came and found me and broke the news <b>[about being captain]</b>. It’s a great honour for me personally. We’ve got a big task ahead of us and it’s something we can be proud of. We started this campaign a while ago and the job was to try to win every single game. Normally you say that and probably not a lot of people expect you to do so but we’ve got some great performances along the way. It’s nice that we’ll hopefully have the opportunity to do so but we know it’s going to be a difficult game. With a few of the boys going <b>[home]</b> and a few of us getting a bit of an opportunity, whether you’ve got caps or not, these are the opportunities you want. The squad is strong. It’s up to us who get the chance to go and prove ourselves and put a performance on.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jagielka buoyed by <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> transfer business]</b> It’s nice to get some business done. Obviously we know we’re going to be in Europe so we need a slightly bigger squad. I’m sure there’ll be plenty more ins and outs before the transfer window shuts, but it’s nice to see that we’ve managed to get a few players in. Quite a few young lads as well, for the club moving forward, which is fantastic. I’m sure I won’t see them for a few weeks, most of them are still playing in the Under-21 <b>[European Championship]</b> tournament. It’s nice to see the club are progressing well. You feel that. Everyone’s got that little bit more money to spend, everyone can get their squad a little bit stronger and after a pretty solid start under <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> last year the fans will be hoping that’s we can kick on. That’s something we want to do. It’ll be a little bit tougher with the extra games, but it’s something that all the players are looking forward to doing</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson and Phil Jagielka are hoping Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma will turn his loan spell at Everton into a permanent move]</b> He’s been brilliant. He’s come and wanted to play more games. He had a bad injury a few years ago and so for his own career and development that’s what he wants. He’s been brilliant, and the situation with Chelsea will probably play some part with where he is next season but we’ll have to wait and go from there</p>
