  <p><b>[Phil Jagielka buoyed by <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> transfer business]</b> It’s nice to get some business done. Obviously we know we’re going to be in Europe so we need a slightly bigger squad. I’m sure there’ll be plenty more ins and outs before the transfer window shuts, but it’s nice to see that we’ve managed to get a few players in. Quite a few young lads as well, for the club moving forward, which is fantastic. I’m sure I won’t see them for a few weeks, most of them are still playing in the Under-21 <b>[European Championship]</b> tournament. It’s nice to see the club are progressing well. You feel that. Everyone’s got that little bit more money to spend, everyone can get their squad a little bit stronger and after a pretty solid start under <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> last year the fans will be hoping that’s we can kick on. That’s something we want to do. It’ll be a little bit tougher with the extra games, but it’s something that all the players are looking forward to doing</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jagielka has announced he is to leave Everton after spending 12 seasons at Goodison Park]</b> It’s been hard to confirm my situation for next season as that decision hadn’t been fully made by the club until now, unfortunately my journey at Everton has come to an end after 12 fantastic seasons. I have been lucky enough to play over 380 games and lucky enough to be club captain for six years. All I can say is thanks to all the players I’ve played alongside, all the staff that have helped me in their own way, the chairman and of course the amazing fans. Wishing everyone associated with this special club the very best for the future!!</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jagielka reveals 20-minute chat with <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> that convinced him to return home.

But at the time they were after a couple of centre halves - <a href="kurt-zouma.html">Kurt Zouma</a>, who we’d had on loan. So it got to the point where they couldn’t really make their mind up. So the easy decision for them was to let me go and try and find somewhere else.<br /><br />It wasn’t nice to hear but in the end the best place I could have come to was the place I started my career at. It was quite surreal. <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> rang me up and asked me to pop over to Sheffield and have a 20-minute chat with him. I was sold on the idea</p>
