  <p><b>[Oblak proud as Atletico reach fourth Champions League quarter-final in a row]</b> We feel very good. Atletico are in the quarter-finals for the fourth year in a row and it’s very important for the club. We fought to win. It didn’t turn out like that but the important thing is to be in the quarters. Of course, it’s not easy to be in the best eight teams in Europe for four years. I hope we keep improving and keep achieving big things</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> goalkeeper Jan Oblak says he would consider a move away from the club, but not until 2018]</b> I’m an Atletico player and I will be until the end of the season. After that, I don’t know, we’ll see. You never know. Sometimes things change from one day to the next. For now, I only talk about Atletico, where I’m happy. I’ve said that I will stay for at least one more season. I hope we have a good campaign</p>

I will stay at Atletico as long as their ambitions match mine. And some people might think their ambitions have lowered, as big players have left. I am sure the club will do everything possible to sign quality players. When I signed my new contract they gave me guarantees about the club’s ambition.

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> goalkeeper Jan Oblak affirmed he is delighted to see <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> make an instant impression at the club]</b> We’re still in pre-season but it’s clear that he’s a huge talent. With talent like that he can grow to be a magnificent player. I’m sure that this is the right place for him. He’s going to progress a lot under <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> and he’ll learn a lot. There’s no doubt that he’s a great talent and if he continues as he’s started, if he trains hard and keeps playing at the level he’s shown he’ll be a world-class player, no doubt<br /><br /><b>[Having finished second to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the 2018-19 Liga campaign, Oblak also affirmed that a new-look Atletico side go into the new term confident that they have the ability to fight for silverware]</b> A lot of new players have arrived and some players who did great things for the club over many years have left. Our new teammates have come in with a lot of enthusiasm and dreams of achieving great things here. All of us that are here, including the new guys, will do all we can to achieve our goals this season.<br /><br />Obviously, we need time to get to know each other but the early signs are really good. They’re players with a lot of quality, the quality you need to be here. They look really sharp and keen in training, really willing to learn, to see what the coach wants from them. That’s the way to build a strong team, a solid team like we’ve always had. I’m sure we’ll go far this season.<br /><br />Our primary focus is preparing well for the new season. After that we go one game at a time, not thinking too far into the future. You just don’t know what surprises the season will throw up. We need to think about one training session at a time, one game at a time. I think we can achieve great things. We all want to win titles and that’s hopefully what we’ll do<br /><br /><b>[There were also warm words for <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, who enters his ninth season at the Colchonero helm]</b> Not many clubs in the modern age have been able to build such a long-term project with a single manager like we have. It’s a really good thing; the manager knows the club inside out, the fans love him and he’ll transfer his style to the new players. It’s a challenge for him but he’s one of the best coaches in the world and he’ll continue to achieve great things, just like every year. The most important thing is to integrate the new players as quickly as possible</p>

The club has made a lot of effort to bring him here and we all agree that they have brought a high-quality player and that he can become one of the best, for sure.<br /><br />At the moment he is playing very well and hopefully he continues like this, giving us joy. It was a complicated game. Any team will have problems here against Leganes. Vitolo came on and scored the winning goal but in general the whole team played in the best possible way. We have defended well, we have suffered. It is important to know how to suffer because you cannot dominate the whole game</p>

  <p><b>[Oblak smashes <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> record as <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> rout Osasuna]</b> I’m feeling very good. It doesn’t feel like we had a three-month break. I’m feeling good in goal and I think the team is too. Maybe you could tell after the first game, but now we’re improving and I hope we attack the upcoming matches like we did today. To be honest, I don’t pay much attention to stats. I hear what people say. It’s a nice milestone to reach but I hope it doesn’t stay there!<br /><br />This season has been strange, one like no other, and it will not be the same when we play behind closed doors as our fans are like an extra player, but who knows how this season will end? Regarding the Zamora Award, I never think about it. This year it isn’t just <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a>, as there are two or three goalkeepers that are having a great season. But I don’t care about the Zamora Award, I just want to reach the Champions League</p>
