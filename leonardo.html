  <p><b>[Neymar’s father insists PSG knew about late pre-season return]</b> The reason <b>[for his absence]</b> is known and was scheduled one year ago, with the annual schedule of his institute, and we couldn’t change it. His return will be on the 15th. It’s as simple as that… no controversy. And PSG are aware and are part of the institute’s actions. We have commercial and institutional programs. Those dates were scheduled a month ago. PSG were informed - they were even present at the event last year. The Neymar Institute organises these events every year and everybody know the dates. We scheduled this year’s dates on July the 10th. On the 13th, there’s the Neymar Jr’s Fives tournament and then after these dates, he will be present at PSG on the 15th like we informed the club weeks ago</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo has said Neymar is allowed to leave the club but says there have been no offers despite ‘superficial’ talks with Barcelona]</b> Neymar can leave PSG, if there is an offer that suits everyone. But to date, we do not know if anyone wants to buy him or at what price. All this is not done in a day, that’s for sure. It’s clear to everyone <b>[that Neymar wants to leave]</b>, but in football, you say one thing today and tomorrow another. It’s amazing but it’s like that. We talked with his entourage too. Everyone knows everything. The position is clear for all participants. But one thing is concrete today: he still has three years of contract with us and since we have not received an offer, we cannot discuss anything<br /><br />PSG wants to rely on players who want to stay and build something big. We do not need players who would do a favour for the club by staying here<br /><br /><b>[Although Leonardo confirmed informal talks with Barcelona about a potential deal, he said no offer has been made for the 27-year-old]</b> We have not received any offers. But we had, it’s true, very superficial contacts <b>[with Barcelona]</b>. They said they wanted to buy but we were not sellers. <b>[Bartomeu]</b> is the one saying it, but we did not see that Barcelona was really in a buyer position<br /><br /><b>[Leonardo’s comments come on the same day PSG announced that they will take action against the Brazilian attacker after he missed training on Monday, though his father says the club had already agreed to the delay]</b> He wasn’t here in training. He had to arrive and he did not arrive. But he knew he had to be there. We will study the measures we need to take, as we would do for all employees. He made commitments to his institute and a sponsor, but these were not dates agreed with the club. However, he played his last game on June 6. The holidays were until July 8th and he didn’t come<br /><br /><b>[Asked when Neymar will report for training]</b> I do not know. The only thing I know is that he was not there on the scheduled date, July 8th</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo has confirmed the club will not pursue a deal for Matthijs de Ligt, believing it is too expensive despite the Ajax star being a great player]</b> De Ligt will not come to PSG. There was a possibility. He is a great player but it was not a good time to make a big investment. We must calm down a little. We don’t have an envelope of €200 million to spend<br /><br />We need a defensive midfielder and maybe a player to complete the central defense. In attack, we have many solutions. It will also be important this season to see young players get on the main team. But there is also important data, it should not be hidden: it is financial fair play. The rules and criteria in force must be respected<br /><br /><b>[With De Ligt not an option, Leonardo was also asked about another high-profile centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly]</b> <b>[Koulibaly]</b> is a very expensive player. There is no specific project for the moment. But I do not want to talk too much about individual cases</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo says Kylian Mbappe is a priority for Paris Saint-Germain though the Brazilian does not believe he is in any position to promise club supporters that their young star will be staying put]</b> There’s no doubt he’s a priority for us or not. Mbappe is here and he is very important to the club, there’s no question about it. When training resumed on Monday, he arrived with a great attitude - a big smile on his face. As always. He’s very charismatic, the fans love him. It’s important to have a player like him in the team - one who’s young and always happy and smiling<br /><br />I never make promises for two reasons. Firstly because I am not the person who is responsible for everything that happens at this club and secondly, I don’t want to throw promises up into the air without being sure that they can be kept. I’m only interested in reality, and what we know for sure today</p>

There is no concrete offer for Neymar, he is with us. He is a player for Paris Saint-Germain. I repeat, there is no concrete offer. It’s been the same situation for 10 days<br /><br /><b>[Leonardo said the mooted signing of Idrissa Gana Gueye from Everton was just a possibility]</b> The squad is already competitive, there is a bit of everything, young players, very experienced players. We targeted a central defender and a defensive midfielder. The central defender has arrived with Abdou Diallo, and now we are looking for the midfielder</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo has dismissed reports that Neymar has been removed from the squad because he wants to leave the club]</b> It’s false. He has not been removed from the group. He is following a personalised rehabilitation program. He is a Paris-Saint-Germain player, there are still three years left on his contract in Paris, we must not forget that. We must analyse everything, we must fix everything before he can play again. Things are simple, Neymar was monitored by several great doctors and surgeons early in the season and his fracture is fully consolidated on the fifth metatarsal. Neymar’s injury is completely healed<br /><br />There are discussions for his future as you know it today but nothing advanced. Neymar made mistakes. You know, I didn’t know him. As the days go by, I get to know him. And I honestly think he’s a good boy with a very good background. And on the pitch, he’s an amazing player</p>

He showed up on time <b>[for training]</b> after his matches with Brazil and he behaved very well. He played an important game in not easy conditions. And he scored a spectacular goal, in a Hollywood scenario. And, after the match, he made an honest and very good statement<br /><br />It’s certain that, if we look at what he said word for word, we’ll always find things to comment on. And it’s true that we can’t say today that everything is settled. But you can’t make a Mexican telenovela around it all. We have to play and to train<br /><br />He is now subject to the same internal rules as all the other players. He’s here and he’s part of the club. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is not a bad guy.

I think it is not the time to talk about it. First of all, Kylian is a player under contract with us for two and a half more years. Speaking all the time about dreams and will, I think it is time to stop a bit. Kylian is very important for us – he is the best young French player, a world champion and one of the best players in the world. This is not the time to knock him and destabilise him.

We are in direct contact, all the time and about everything. It is true Thomas was already here when I arrived, there are many things we still need to know about each other. However, this is how it works between a sporting director and a coach who was already in place. The coach has his ideas and that is very important.

Because he’s an adorable, very committed person and a fantastic player.<br /><br /><b>[The former Brazil international then asked a journalist in attendance who they thought the top five players in the world were]</b> In the Top 4, there is one 35 years old, another 32 years old and the other two they are 28 and 21 years old. And these two are with us. Let us rejoice. I am a happy sports director. We should take advantage of that. It’s the joy of football. We have to stop talking about the problems<br /><br /><b>[There is a perception they are held back by the strength of the French league]</b> We say that this team is not ready, that <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is not at the level. That the club does not know how to manage its stars. I want to understand why? Because we have the right to be happy from time to time. The team is 1st, with 12 points ahead. We have an incredible squad. Our best players are in shape. Why do we have to be worried every time when the last sixteen arrives? Why do we have to stress? It won’t be a matter of life and death against
Borussia. We’re just playing a Champions League match. I think the team is ready. If we win, that’s good. Otherwise, too bad, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> will continue to grow. We have to get out of this</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva to leave <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> this summer]</b> It was a really difficult decision to take. <b>[Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani]</b> are players who have had a big impact on this club’s history. You always wonder if you should carry on down the same path together or if it’s better to avoid a scenario where you’ve stayed for one year too many. It’s been such a wonderful journey, but we’re coming to the end. We had to make a logical decision, both in financial terms and also considering the next generation of players coming through. Maybe it’s the wrong decision, I don’t know. There’s never a perfect moment. The Champions League is still on the agenda and the plan is to remain in the competition with them until the end of August</p>

  <p><b>[PSG’s Leonardo confirms that <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> will stay on as manager]</b> He has one year left on his contract and he will be on the bench next season. He has done well, the results are good. An extension? We have time to think about it. I surveyed no coach. Never. With <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, we talked, he knows everything. It’s very clear, there’s nothing with anyone<br /><br />It’s terrible for clubs because it places us in complex situations where we have the choice between letting go or overpaying. At <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, there is competition. So, at 16-17 years old, it’s difficult to claim a place. And generally, since they don’t play, they don’t sign and go to clubs that have been courting them for two years. His (Kouassi’s) case is different, he found himself in the rotation without having yet signed a contract. It may be an error on my part, because the custom in this business is: ‘you do not sign, you do not play’. But his performance levels took priority. We probably have our responsibilities if we do not manage to keep our youngsters</p>
