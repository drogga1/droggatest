  <p><b>[Leonardo laughs off <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> ‘love’ after <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> fight back for draw]</b> Did he say that? I hadn’t seen anything! The only thing I know is that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is 100 per cent staying here. The rest is by the by. We are moving slowly <b>[on a new contract]</b> but we are going forward<br /><br /><b>[The first half at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a> ended in controversy when Madrid goalkeeper <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> was spared a red card thanks to VAR, which spotted a foul on <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> prior to the goalkeeper’s clumsy challenge that took down <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>]</b> The pictures are clear, I promised myself I wouldn’t talk about the referee. At the time of Idrissa <b>[Gueye’s]</b> hypothetical foul, the referee was not far from the action and he said there was no foul, then there was a penalty. Perhaps it wasn’t a red card, but he gave it, VAR called and he thought there had been a mistake, but it had already passed, it wasn’t a mistake. The rules say that he has the right to look back if it is a serious error. We can dispute that, but it wasn’t a serious mistake, he made it twice, that action could change the game. I understand <b>[fans’ anger]</b>. But I don’t think it is against PSG: if we look at everything that has happened over the last few years, I’d say we come out on top</p>

It makes me feel uncomfortable. If a player leaves the field, and talks to the coach, ok … He is at fault. We will talk about it and settle this. But to say that he is a spoiled child, I don’t accept that. Because he’s an adorable, very committed person and a fantastic player.<br /><br /><b>[The former Brazil international then asked a journalist in attendance who they thought the top five players in the world were]</b> In the Top 4, there is one 35 years old, another 32 years old and the other two they are 28 and 21 years old.

That the club does not know how to manage its stars. I want to understand why? Because we have the right to be happy from time to time. The team is 1st, with 12 points ahead. We have an incredible squad. Our best players are in shape. Why do we have to be worried every time when the last sixteen arrives? Why do we have to stress? It won’t be a matter of life and death against
Borussia. We’re just playing a Champions League match. I think the team is ready. If we win, that’s good. Otherwise, too bad, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> will continue to grow. We have to get out of this</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s Leonardo confirms that <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> will stay on as manager]</b> He has one year left on his contract and he will be on the bench next season. He has done well, the results are good. An extension? We have time to think about it. I surveyed no coach. Never. With <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, we talked, he knows everything. It’s very clear, there’s nothing with anyone<br /><br />It’s terrible for clubs because it places us in complex situations where we have the choice between letting go or overpaying. At <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, there is competition. So, at 16-17 years old, it’s difficult to claim a place. And generally, since they don’t play, they don’t sign and go to clubs that have been courting them for two years. His (Kouassi’s) case is different, he found himself in the rotation without having yet signed a contract. It may be an error on my part, because the custom in this business is: ‘you do not sign, you do not play’. But his performance levels took priority. We probably have our responsibilities if we do not manage to keep our youngsters</p>
