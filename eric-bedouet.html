<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Samuel Kalu - The Nigerian nomad at home in Ligue 1]</b> For a centre forward, wingers like Kalu and Francois Kamano are precious. Kalu’s crossing is very, very good. They both possess great physical qualities and have a little of the same style: they’re very quick, direct, powerful and physically-strong. Look at the build of Kalu - he’s capable of stopping with the ball then accelerating again, making the difference in a game all in one action.<br /><br />Both of them together, it’s quite annoying for opponents. They have to continue these performances for the duration</p>

  <p><b>[Bordeaux coach: PSG aren’t refereed the same as other teams]</b> I have said it before … They are not refereed in the same way as others. I heard the other coach <b>[Thomas Tuchel]</b> complained but I think it’s too much. VAR is starting to tire me! It takes too much time to make decisions. On the first goal, he is embarrassed <b>[Mbappe]</b> and he is offside!<br /><br />It was a very good match, I’m happy with my team, it was not easy, the slightest mistake and you are punished. We came back twice, against a team like PSG, that’s not easy. We did everything well except on Kylian Mbappe’s goal where we were too attracted to the goal. We did not have security, but we made a solid match with a full stadium</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Francois Kamano taking Ligue 1 by storm]</b> He’s on a cloud right now. We’ve seen him go on streaks like this before, but now he’s doing it consistently. He’s taken a step up in his career. It’s not easy to play games of this value over an extended period of time.<br /><br />He’s got a habit of scoring goals like that. He’s got quality, which we know and he knows, too. When he does something like that, when he can beat a goalkeeper like that, it’s extra ordinary</p>
