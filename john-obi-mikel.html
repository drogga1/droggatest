  <p><b>[Why does Mikel-Hiddink work so well for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Since the new manager came in we have been working really hard and as I said before, the atmosphere has changed a bit. The players seem more relaxed and as we are working hard in training, it is now starting to show in the matches that we play</p>

  <p><b>[Cameroon’s hopes of reaching the 2018 World Cup rest on securing back-to-back victories over Nigeria]</b> As everyone knows, they are a very good team. They are strong and they play with confidence. We must get ourselves well prepared for this game and try our best to get on top against them. It won’t be easy but these are important matches. If we win both, we will be almost there.</p>

  <p><b>[John Obi Mikel has accused Chelsea boss Antonio Conte of displaying a lack of respect]</b> Definitely it was the right time <b>[to leave]</b> because when you have a manager who… you have to come in whoever you are - manager or player - there are people who have been there before who made this club what it is today. Chelsea was nowhere near what it is 10, 15 years ago. There are players that build and build and build, then it’s all about respect. When you don’t get that from a manager who comes in and after five minutes decides to make a change you deal with it, you move on. My connection with the club has not changed because of the manager or because of a certain person. My relationship with the club remains. I am a blue and I want to remain that way for years and years to come.<br /><br />It doesn’t concern me at all. The club is in really good hands, run by Marina <b>[Granovskaia]</b> now. She loves the club. I think she makes decisions purely on the betterment of the club, which is how a club should be run. She does exactly what Roman wants her to do. Roman loves the club. He has devoted his time, money into this football club. He has made Chelsea what it is today. I don’t care what anyone says, Roman made Chelsea what Chelsea is today and I think, because of the amount of wealth he has brought into this country, everybody owes him a little bit of appreciation</p>

This is a massive tournament - you can’t rest people and give others a chance of qualification. They should be professional and play their best team. This is such a big stage that you can’t rest players just to help other teams to qualify.<br /><br /><b>[Mikel is aware that recording the victory his side require will be no easy task]</b> I think they have played well.

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo rose inside his own box and headed the ball against his own arm]</b> It was a clear penalty for me. If you look at the Portugal game yesterday, this wasn’t close to that. This was worse. We have seen it again in the dressing room. It was a clear handball. The referee looked at the VAR. He said it hit the hand.

In the process of the rescue, a gun duel ensued between police operatives and the kidnappers, which forced the hoodlums to abandon their victims inside the forest and they were promptly rescued<br /><br /><b>[John Obi Mikel has revealed that he was aware of his father’s kidnap ahead of the clash with the South American side but insisted he took part in the game]</b> I was confused.

  <p><b>[Chelsea have been accused of lacking leaders by John Obi Mikel]</b> When I watch them now, they’re fantastic players but I don’t see leaders. During our time I could scream at Didier Drogba or Lampard. I was 24 or 25 years old but I could voice my opinion and it would be heard. Now when I watch them, there’s no one talking to each other, taking responsibility of being the leader. You need that edge and right now that’s what they’re lacking</p>

I was told to meet with the president in his office one-on-one. He asked me to take <b>[the post]</b> down. I told him I wasn’t going to do that. It’s my opinion. This is how I feel. We live in a free world. I have freedom of speech. I can express my opinion<br /><br />I wanted to win the league too but at this point in time we have to think about what is more important: to save peoples’ lives. I want to help in any way that I can to defeat this virus. For us to be out there playing; I don’t think we are helping the global situation. I don’t feel it is right for us to play football. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> have postponed football. How come they are still playing in Turkey? It’s not right at all. But <a href="trabzonspor.html">Trabzonspor</a> were not having it - for me, they don’t care<br /><br />I explained to the club that I needed to see and be with my kids. They were calling me every single morning, crying on the phone, wondering why their friends were not coming over for playdates, why they can’t touch anyone on the street. I knew if I came home, they’d be relaxed because they’d then know Daddy was home. I told the club, ‘OK, if that’s what you’re saying, I’m ready to give up my contract. To be with my family, to help the world to do the right thing - everybody needs to stay at home at this point in time’. Go back to <a href="trabzonspor.html">Trabzonspor</a>? No chance. Not with the way they have dealt with this situation. We have to look at ourselves sometimes in life and ask what is more important? Who do I want to be friends with? When I’m in trouble, who is going to look after me? And, the way they have dealt with this, I don’t see myself going back to <a href="trabzonspor.html">Trabzonspor</a> again</p>
