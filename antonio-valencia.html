  <p><b>[Manchester United are absolutely still in the hunt for a top-four finish]</b> Absolutely. Nobody is giving up at all. You know there is half a season left to play so it’s all about working hard, battling and playing well. We know we have got the quality within the squad to be able to do that. It is all about being focused and the aim is still to get into those top four places. We also want to go as far as we can in the Champions League - why not get to the final? Why not try to win the two cup competitions we are still involved in?.<br /><br /><b>[Valencia added on a contest which will see the Red Devils take to home soil for the first time under Solskjaer]</b> The main thing is to get everyone together at Old Trafford after Christmas and it is a great fact we don’t have to travel as it’s on our doorstep. Playing in front of our fans is always a special occasion. We are getting the chance to make them happy and hopefully put any recent bad results behind us to get into good form again. We need to start putting a string of wins together and putting in a good performance to make the fans happy</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia expecting Man Utd to challenge for ‘every trophy’ in 2018-19]</b> I think it’s positive thoughts throughout when you look back on things. We’ve scored more goals, picked up more points, conceded fewer and I think we’ve played better. You want to take that forward into next season and try to put things right that maybe haven’t gone so well this season and improve upon results in games. We want to win even more games and not slip up in the type of the matches where we might have slipped up this season. All that considered, it’s looking good for next season and let’s hope we can be fighting for every trophy that’s available to us.<br /><br />After the game on Saturday, of course it was a fantastic feeling and, two days later when you come back into training, it still felt brilliant and that great vibe stays with you. You carry it with you into the next training sessions which is what we’ve done. I think we’ve done really well in key games. Those good results and performances only serve to motivate us even more for the rest of this season and especially for next season as well. It’s like a message that we’re sending to ourselves and it has extra motivation for us. It reinforces the fact we have a great squad, a great team and a strong dressing room, ahead of the next season, which will hopefully be a great one for us</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United captain Antonio Valencia has apologised for inadvertently ‘liking’ an Instagram post calling for manager Jose Mourinho to be sacked]</b> Yesterday, I liked a post on Instagram without reading the text that accompanied the picture. These are not my views and I apologise for this. I am fully supportive of the manager and my teammates. We are all giving our everything to improve the results.<br /><br />No, I have never had any problem with anyone, thank God. The decision <b>[about the captaincy]</b> is for the coach to make, now we need to see the positives. We played an important game and got a point, now we have a game against Newcastle and we need to fight. What I can say from the inside is that the lads are calm, working every day with a good attitude. We haven’t got good results and that’s why rumours arise</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Valencia claims a tactical decision is keeping him out of the Manchester United side]</b> Right now I haven’t been playing, but it’s more of a tactical decision. The player who has been in my place <b>[Ashley Young]</b> has been playing well. You have to respect the decision. The only thing I can do is prepare and be ready for when he <b>[Mourinho]</b> needs me and be in the right condition to compete. I’m calm right now and I know I’ll get an opportunity to play again. The relationship with Mourinho has always been a good one</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> will be eternally grateful to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for 10 years at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> It’s hard to forget the players I played with. Greats like Giggs, Rooney, Scholes, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, <b>[Nemanja]</b> Vidic, Patrice <b>[Evra]</b> … it’s hard to believe I’m even sat here listing these names and it’s impossible to name them all or pick out just one as the best, so I’ll just say that I’m so happy to have played with some very intelligent footballers.<br /><br />I have so many memories of my time here, but also so many other items. Honestly, I’ve got an entire <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Museum in my house! I’ve got things in there that are very valuable to me. They represent my life here and all the effort I’ve put in. There isn’t any amount of money that could pay for the things in there and the memories I have in my head.<br /><br />There are two things that are my favourite items: the first shirt I wore for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and the armband from when <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> gave me the captaincy for the first time. These things, these memories, they’re absolutely priceless to me.<br /><br />My heart, my affections will always lie with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I will always be a fan of the club, but I’ll always have my affection for the people here at the club and in the city. My daughter has enjoyed ten happy years here in Manchester. This has been a wonderful home.<br /><br />I will keep the team and the fans close to my heart. To the United fans, you have always been great with me, so I’d just like to say thank you for all your support during this fantastic time I’ve had with the club. I hope you keep enjoying supporting United and they continue to win many more trophies in the future. Muchas Gracias</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> has admitted that he struggles to watch <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as it is painful for him to follow his former team]</b> Honestly, I do not watch all of the games now. It is painful for me. I try to watch but it makes me very sad. I have United in my heart: the city, the fans, 10 years of my life. It is too hard to watch the defeats. I miss being there<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on what made United so successful under Ferguson]</b> This was a team of absolute winners. I remember arriving at United and winning a game at the weekend. I thought: ‘Phew, now we can relax a little.’ Then straight away everyone was talking about winning the next game. There was never time to enjoy the wins. But that’s what title winners do. I’d get to training: <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a>, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> were all in the gym, way before training started. I am thinking: ‘These guys have Champions League winners’ medals, they are multi-millionaires, and here they are in the gym at 7am?’<br /><br />Imagine that determination, that inner steel, that hunger. As a young player, what a lesson: these people are not only winners but they are addicted to winning. <b>[They were]</b> demanding, too. The players policed the dressing room. There was nothing worse than lateness from a young player, because 34-year-olds had arrived two hours before to do extra work. Do people realise these hard yards? They see results, who wins and who plays well, but they don’t get to see the sacrifices. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, for goodness sake! I got there when he was <b>[in his]</b> mid-30s and he’s taking up yoga so he can keep winning and then he’s leading the way in fitness drills. Amazing</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> offers first-hand insight into <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s fall from grace]</b> That day, when he told us he was leaving, he was emotional. We were all emotional. I was really sad. If he had stayed another year, I think we could have won the Champions League or another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. You just knew at the start of a Ferguson season you were going to win something<br /><br />It was different <b>[when <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> came in]</b>. Ferguson, he had this way of making every player feel important. Then <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> came and maybe only a certain group of players felt this importance<br /><br /><a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> did not have the same opportunities to play. Ferguson just had this way of managing the expectations of a player. ‘OK, you aren’t playing this one but I need you ready to score against this team in 10 days.’ This kept players happy. Then <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> came and not everyone could be kept happy, partly because the pressure came very early. But the players have their own responsibility, too. But maybe it’s normal, after 26 years … Ferguson was excellent, a magician as a coach<br /><br />When I got to United, Ferguson told me, ‘Your English needs to get better quickly, it is important for the team.’ I understand everything now. When I first joined Wigan, my translator Phil Dickinson sat next to me in the dressing room and then even came onto the training pitch in T-shirt and shorts. He was malissimo (terrible)! But a great guy. Everyone at Wigan helped me. <a href="emile-heskey.html">Emile Heskey</a> learned some Spanish words and wrote them down to help me out.<br /><br />At United, let’s be honest, I could tell when Sir Alex was grumpy because his face became much redder! But seriously, he knew exactly what to say, when we won and we lost. Take one FA Cup game against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It’s half-time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. I will never forget, he pulls me, ‘You have 10 more minutes to do something and if you don’t, I’m taking you off.’ In front of everyone, of course. He was putting a lot of pressure on me and I responded. But inside, I was on edge, nervous, anxious but he provoked an improvement. He would often go for guys like <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> and <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>, so younger players would think, ‘If even they are getting it, then I definitely cannot rest on my laurels.’ The next day, after <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he called me into his office, told me I had his trust completely, to feel free on the pitch, to enjoy the game.</p>

I made a mistake. I was on Instagram and I pressed the ‘like’ button on a comment by a fan. I never realised what it said. Jose is a smart guy. It was nothing. I sought the manager out, I said sorry and end of story. He said, ‘No problem’. I didn’t play in the last few games for Jose but it was nothing to do with that. It was different reasons.

That’s what winners do, right? He was good with days off but he wanted us to be sensible, to cleanse the mind on a day off and return completely fresh for the next training session. This is why he has won so much. When he praises you, he can make you feel so special. When he arrived, I was expecting exactly what happened: to win titles. This is what we did, two in his first season. He is a winner; he knows what he wants and that came across</p>
