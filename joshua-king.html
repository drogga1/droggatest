We haven’t performed how we should have in the first four games and maybe the international break came at a good time because we can regroup and focus on Sunday because we need three points</p>

  <p><b>[Former United academy graduate Joshua King scored the only goal just before the interval for Bournemouth 1-0 winning against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> We know we can score goals but in the past our problems have been keeping clean sheets. When you get the goal, they start coming. We’ve kept a clean sheet for three games now. We backed ourselves to score in the next few games and we managed it today</p>

  <p><b>[Joshua King has revealed his burning ambition to play Champions League football at some point in his career]</b> I wanted to make it at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> but I didn’t, so I took a step back to <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> in the Championship. It’s my dream to play for a top club one day, but I am enjoying my time at Bournemouth. I’m learning a lot with <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a>. I enjoy being with my team-mates, who also make me a better player as well. My long-term dream is to play Champions League football. If I retire and look back and I haven’t played in the Champions League then I will be disappointed in myself. Right now I am enjoying my time at Bournemouth, but I think we can do even better than we are currently. We have a great squad, team and staff. It’s just little things we need to sort to turn draws into wins<br /><br /><b>[King says that the Cherries got ahead of themselves last season by targeting a Europa League spot but that they have learned their lesson]</b> Last year we set ourselves the goal to get into the Europa League and this year we are taking it game-by-game. I think that’s a lot better for focus. We tried to reach the Europa League from the start of the season but then we had 38 games to play and you can’t control what happens. You can only control what you yourself do and take it game-by-game to get the three points every time. Then anything is possible. When you have got 10 games left at the end of the season, then you can start thinking this is actually possible.<br /><br />It’s our fifth year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> now. In the first few years it was easier to get carried away but all of us have been in the league for a while now. We know that we should block out the media noise to focus on ourselves. We know things will automatically happen if we work hard. Last season, I remember there was a bit of talk in the dressing room about breaking the top six because we were amazing in the first 10 games. This season there’s been nothing in the changing room really. We knew that if we beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> we would go top six but then we dropped down after the Sunday games. It can be a little booster but you want to try to be there as long as possible.<br /><br />We have a great manager and he has players from League One and the Championship doing well in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. There are some new players - Philip Billing, for example - has been amazing for us this season. I still think he has two more gears to come and he could be one of our best players this season. We also have David Brooks and Junior Stanislas coming back from injury. <a href="lewis-cook.html">Lewis Cook</a> is getting himself back to full fitness, too, so we have got a very, very good squad. When everyone is fit and on our day then I think we can beat anyone. That includes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Joshua King thinks the sky is the limit for both <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Braut Haaland</a> and <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> as his Norway side look to find a route into Euro 2020]</b> From a distance what he is doing is unbelievable. Come on, seven goals in four games in the Champions League is something you can’t say anything about. When I met him, I thought he was a kid playing well and scoring loads of goals in an average league. I saw that he is hungry; he wants to move up and score goals. I think he will go very, very far. He just needs to keep his feet on the ground - not that he isn’t - he just needs to keep doing what he is doing this season. The world is his oyster and the sky is his limit. He is going to be a top, top striker. He is 19 so I don’t want to put pressure on him either, as the media may do. He is very down to earth. He is a bit shy but when he is on the pitch, he has confidence and cockiness - and he has every right.<br /><br />I am looking forward to going to Norway to play together. He is a hungry guy but he is not too cocky. He has confidence and a will to learn. If I scored seven goals in the Champions League at 19 then God knows where I would be right now! I played only two minutes in the Champions League. He has done well for himself. I think he will play out the season and break records. I think he will finish top scorer in the league. It is hard to beat him in the Austrian league. It is good for Norway to have another striker who is delivering abroad<br /><br /><b>[King says too much pressure was put on Odegaard after he was signed for Madrid at 16 years old but that he is now becoming a man]</b> We have <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> as well. He is starting to become a man at <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>. He is the property of Madrid and hopefully he will go back there and be a superstar for them as well. People forget how young he was when he signed for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He was 16! You need time. That’s a lot of attention for a 16-year-old but he has taken it well. He will be a very, very good player but he needs time.<br /><br />Now that he is turning into a man, he has grown muscles, he is taller, stronger and running more. Now people see the <b>[potential]</b> that we were talking about at 16 but I still think Martin has another gear or two in him. You need to give people time. Not everyone can do what 18-year-old <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> did. Some people need a year or two. That’s what Martin needed. Maybe he needed three or four years but he is still only 20 years old. Now in Norway, he will always start.<br /><br />We have good years ahead for Norway. It would be good to be part of it because football has never looked so good in Norway as it does now. For me, I am one of the most senior players and people respect my personality and number of games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so I look forward to going with Norway. There’s loads of talent and you want to play with the best players</p>

I know him as a person and a manager and have loads of respect for him. When he took over United I was very happy for him and his family because I know how much that meant for him as a person - it’s always been his dream.

  <p><b>[Bournemouth striker Josh King has confessed that it would have been a dream come true for him to complete a move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on January 31]</b> I have to watch what I say. I had some faith that it was going to happen. And it was a bit sensitive for me considering that I moved to England as a 16-year-old to achieve my dream and wanted to reach that goal at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It did not <b>[happen]</b> and then I made a choice and left. When you hear that you are connected to United and a bid comes in, then the feelings you had as a 16-year-old come back to you. But why it did not happen, I do not know<br /><br />I’m a Bournemouth player and I really enjoy it here. But it had been a dream come true, I will not lie. But that didn’t happen and I’m going to give everything to Bournemouth as long as I’m in this club. The coach <b>[<a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a>]</b> was absolutely fantastic with me during those days and was very helpful with me. I have respect for how he behaved with me during the little episode. So I just have to keep working hard to try to help the club out of the situation we’re in now</p>
