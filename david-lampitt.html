<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Portsmouth chief executive David Lampitt said the club were looking for a young, up-and-coming new manager and that <a href="michael-appleton.html">Appleton</a> fit the bill]</b> We are delighted to welcome Michael as our new first-team manager. He fought off very strong opposition to get the job from a high quality field of candidates. We were looking for somebody young, forward-thinking and ambitious who wanted to be part of our longer-term plans for Portsmouth Football Club. Michael has an excellent track record as a coach with a positive mentality about the game and the way it should be played. He also has great experience of developing players through from youth team level to the first team<br /><br />We wanted an individual with good knowledge of, and successful track record in, the Championship. Importantly we also wanted someone who would fit in with the existing coaching infrastructure at the club. As a board, we laid down a set of criteria that we were looking for in the new manager and we have not diverted from that. It’s fair to say Michael started out as a bit of a dark horse in the selection process but he ended up the unanimous choice. He is a hands-on coach with a fantastic reputation in the game. He’s positive and analytically astute, coming here with the experience of being an integral part of a very well-run football club for the best part of a decade. He shares our desire and commitment to take the club forward in the right way, and we know that he has a big career in management ahead of him. We also know our supporters and everyone at the club will welcome him and get behind him and the team.</p>
