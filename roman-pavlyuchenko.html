  <p><b>[Roman Pavlyuchenko thinks Russia 2018 will be the best World Cup to date]</b> I’m absolutely sure that fans will like it and I’m sure that it will be the best World Cup in the history of the World Cup. All the fans will come here and enjoy it, I’m absolutely sure. I’ve seen all the stadiums and there’s a venue better than the Luzhniki. The Spartak stadium is even better. If all the stadiums are this good then there is no way that organisationally this cannot be anything but the best World Cup we have ever seen. I think people who come here for the World Cup, will stay here because they will never want to leave. It will be a World Cup to remember</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane must join Barcelona or Real Madrid if he wants to further his career]</b> If Barcelona and Real Madrid call him, then yes, he has to go. But if it’s to join a team that occupies the middle of the table in Spain or Italy, it’s not worth it. But, he must first know what he wants. It is certain that, if Barca and Real are present, then it’s normal to want to go there. Tottenham is a big club, but they don’t play in the final stages of the Champions League. If he wants to go even further, he must, of course, join a bigger club<br /><br /><b>[Pavlyuchenko has been pleased to see the progress Kane has made in recent years]</b> Today, as you can see, he scores a lot of goals. Many clubs want him and for that I can only say ‘well done’. I look at him and see how effective he is. This pleases me, especially since I was at his side during the first steps. I am very happy for him. He is a great Tottenham player today<br /><br />Tottenham has always had a very seductive style of football. This team is very attacking and produces a good passing game. They play a spectacular type of football. The players come and go, but the style remains the same. Personally, I have always liked it. When Tottenham became interested in me, I always said that this style suited me. And, it seems to me today that this style has endured and has not changed much.
