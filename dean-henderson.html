  <p><b>[Dean Henderson has signed a new three-year contract at Manchester United and returned to Sheffield United on loan for the 2019-20 campaign]</b> The club has been amazing in designing an individual pathway to aid my development which will enable me to reach my potential and perform at the highest level possible. Signing this contract is such a proud moment for myself and my family; I’ve worked so hard to reach this point and I want to do everything I can to repay the faith the club has shown in me. I am looking forward to being back at Bramall Lane, the opportunity to be reunited with the coaches and play in front of the amazing fans again is one that I am relishing. I cannot wait to enjoy a full season of Premier League football which I know will be hugely beneficial for my career</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United loanee goalkeeper Dean Henderson has confessed he was worried he might not return to the club he helped win promotion to the Premier League last season]</b> Every single day. I was always worried, even though I made it clear I wanted it to happen. Everyone wanted it to happen, no one more so than me. But I was getting nervous about things, yes. The longer things went on it was only natural I got concerned. But now it’s sorted, I’m so relieved. I’m delighted to come back, everybody knows and can see that<br /><br /><b>[He signed a new three-year deal with the Red Devils on July 26 and was immediately sent to Sheffield on a deal until the end of the 2019-20 season]</b> To represent Sheffield United up there is going to be an honour. From my point of view, it suits everyone for me to come back here and I can’t wait to get started properly</p>

Everyone wanted it to happen, no one more so than me. But I was getting nervous about things, yes. The longer things went on it was only natural I got concerned. But now it’s sorted, I’m so relieved.

  <p><b>[Dean Henderson admits to not feeling like a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player, but is happy to be bucking the trend by heading out of Old Trafford in search of game time and recognition elsewhere]</b> Hopefully I can fulfil the ambition of playing for them one day and why not if I keep going the way I’m going? I still don’t believe I am a Man United player yet. I still feel I have a lot of work to do to get to that level<br /><br /><b>[He added on his career path to date]</b> For me, it was all about getting out on loan and trying something different. I always wanted to get out there and prove myself, rather than sit in my comfort zone. There are many players who are just happy to sit there and say they are <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players, but realistically you aren’t for me until you are in the first team. I would like to see more goalkeepers go out into the lower leagues because it would be a big test for them. I’ve proven I can play in every division. The lower down the pyramid, the harder it was to be honest. Stockport was my hardest loan. I can still remember making mistakes and it was so difficult. I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me up, but I was only a young kid and I have learnt so much since those early days</p>

  <p><b>[Henderson’s ‘big dream’ hints at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> return to compete with De Gea]</b> The big dream is to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> one day. I’ve always had that dream throughout my life so until that’s accomplished I’ll never think I’ve made it. Even if I play for them once I won’t think I’ve made it. I need to play for them 500 times, 300 times, whatever it is, then you can turnaround at the end of your career and say, ‘I made it, I did what I set out to do’. <b>[I want to]</b> get to 40 points first and foremost to stay up <b>[with Sheffield United]</b>. If we do that, win as many games as possible towards the end of the season and then going into the summer fight for the No.1 spot as much as I can. That’s what I’ll be doing and hopefully I can make it happen</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson believes his impressive form this season can help him supplant <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a> in goal for England at Euro 2020]</b> Hopefully I can nail down a place in the Euros squad first. Being ambitious like I am, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, I’ve got my eyes on the shirt. I’ve just got to keep performing, keep doing well and hopefully get an opportunity because you can’t prove anything without an opportunity, then see where we are in the summer. Obviously there are three great goalkeepers. We’ve got a great group and it’s going to be a great battle for the shirt. Hopefully towards the summer it could be very interesting to see who gets the nod<br /><br /><b>[Henderson credits manager <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> with the Blades’ success this season, saying he’s instilled confidence and belief in the players, while urging them to greater and greater heights]</b> The manager demands more from us. When we get to 40 points, we’re not going to stop at 40 points. People may think we will be happy and think what a great first season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But we want to go higher, we want to fight for Europe, we want to get in the Europa League. Why not go for Champions League? Who knows? Everyone thought we would go straight back down with the least points in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history. Look at us now, so we’ve just got to keep striving</p>

  <p><b>[He talks about his rise into England contention]</b> That’s what you work for, isn’t it? That’s what you work for, isn’t it? I’ve been there before with the (Under) 21s when it looked impossible (to become first choice). I’ve just got to keep my foot on the accelerator and keep working hard and see where it takes me.<br /><br /><b>[Henderson said of his arrival at the Blades in 2018]</b> I went up to see the gaffer and I remember he said, ‘We’ll hopefully get into the play-offs this season’. I was, like, ‘We need to get automatic’. I said it tongue in cheek but it was a great season from all the boys, the memories and relationships I’ve made over the past two seasons have been phenomenal and will live with me forever</p>
