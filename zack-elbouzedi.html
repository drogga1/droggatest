<blockquote>
  <p><b>[His form with the Boys in Green helped earn him a move from League of Ireland side Waterford to Lincoln City, and he credits <a href="stephen-kenny.html">Stephen Kenny</a> with developing his game]</b> He’s so passionate. You can just tell that he eats, sleeps and breathes football.<br /><br />He’s just got that infectious energy. You can tell that every day you work with him that there’s just no place he’d rather be. He puts that belief in you that you’re as good as any team and that you can compete with the best teams. He has that belief in us and in turn, we have that belief in him and that belief in each other.<br /><br />If you look at my performance a year ago against Luxembourg compared to my last one against Sweden, you’ll be able to tell the difference. A lot of it is down to playing regularly with my club at Waterford and getting that confidence and that belief, with two managers Stephen and Alan Reynolds who believed in me a lot.<br /><br />When you have confidence from your manager, as a winger, you have that freedom to express yourself and make mistakes and that’s when your performances start getting better. He’s definitely improved me as a player<br /><br /><b>[Elbouzedi says the players are not affected by the pressure of being named Ireland’s golden generation, instead stating that Kenny’s management has already instilled the belief in the squad that they can take on and beat any team in the world]</b> Stephen has an expectation of us and we don’t really listen to outside sources, but you’d rather be spoken about like that than not get spoken about at all<br /><br />We just take it all in our stride. No one really feels that pressure. Since the first day that Stephen came in, he said that we wanted to qualify and we didn’t want to settle for being second-best so since the first day we’ve had that expectation for ourselves that we want to be the best we can be. When you see other people talking about it, it doesn’t really have an influence on us because that’s the way we wanted to be from the start.<br /><br />I didn’t play in the Brazil game <b>[at Toulon]</b>, but the Mexico team that I played were up there with one of the best teams that I’ve played. I watched the Brazil game and they were incredible. They’re probably the best team at that age in the world and the lads gave a good account of themselves. When you go on and play other teams, with all the respect, they’re not going to be better than Brazil.<br /><br />We know that we put it up to them so we have nothing to fear when we go out to play the likes of Italy. When you’re nervous you might be starstruck by the players they have, but because we’ve played the likes of Brazil and we’ve put in good performances and got good results, we know we can compete against anyone<br /><br /><b>[Elbouzedi has greatly enjoyed playing in support of Idah, Parrott and Connolly and believes that trio has what it takes to make it to the very top]</b> They’re different players but they’re all goalscorers. They’ve all scored goals at any level they’ve been at.<br /><br />They’re good lads with good attitudes and if they keep going and keep progressing gradually, then the world is their oyster. People need to be careful putting so much pressure on them, they’re only young lads and still only finding their way in the game. The potential is there to be great players<br /><br /><b>[Elbouzedi is no different than those fans and is eyeing senior international caps having impressed the former Dundalk boss at underage level]</b> When it was announced that he was going to get the job, it gave you the extra motivation that if you do well for him, he might take you up<br /><br />He’s not afraid to play young players or bring players through. He spoke about the fact that he won’t be afraid to bring younger players, but obviously you have to be playing first-team football at a good level and doing the business for him on the pitch. <br /><br />He’s not going to bring you up because he likes you or because you did well at a certain age group. I think it’s just about trying to keep that momentum going and to be in a position to capitalise on that when he takes over</p>
