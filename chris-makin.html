<blockquote>
  <p>[Sunderland hit rock bottom last weekend after a 2-1 loss to Burton Albion confirmed their relegation to League One] I don’t think there’s ever been a worse situation at a football club. There can’t be. They’ve got a chairman there who doesn’t go and they’ve been relegated twice in a row, I just don’t see where it gets better.<br /><br />This is the biggest summer in 20 or 30 years for Sunderland, they need to be able to get a squad together who will be able to push for the play-offs and get promoted next year, but that will be a struggle for them because they need to get rid of players who are on massive money who don’t want to move because they don’t want to give away their wages<br /><br />Who’s gonna want to take the debt on in League One? The finances that they bring in next season is going to be nothing compared to what it was in the Premier League. But they’re still paying people as if they’re in the Premier League. If Ellis Short stays, anything is possible. He’s got to pay a lot of money just to keep us afloat, he might just give up and put us into administration - that’s a real possibility</p>
