  <p><b>[Marcus McGuane has said that a coaching change and a new position caused him to lose traction at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> following his senior debut in March 2018]</b> Everything was going smoothly. I still hadn’t gone anywhere near my peak but I felt good. I was playing in my natural position and I felt I was getting better. Then <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> B manager <a href="gerard-lopez.html">Gerard Lopez</a> got sacked and <b>[Garcia Pimienta]</b> replaced him.<br /><br /><b>[McGuane had developed a relationship with Lopez but under the new boss, things were much different]</b> I felt the impact straight away. It happened on a Thursday before a game. We were travelling on the Saturday and I wasn’t even in the squad. It was a bit of a shock. After that it was tough. I never had the same feeling that I had during those first few months<br /><br />Maybe as a kid I played there, when I was nine or 10, but I am not a right winger<br /><br /><b>[McGuane’s frustration led him to seek out an unexpected location for a season-long loan: Dutch second-division side Telstar, managed by McGuane’s former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> youth coach Andries Jonker. Under Jonker, McGuane is hoping to turn his career around]</b> The most important thing for me now is feeling comfortable. Being happy where I am, in a good environment with family and friends and the people that I love around me. Choosing a club this summer has felt like such a big decision. I’m still young, but it feels like a big point in my career</p>
