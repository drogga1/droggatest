  <p><b>[Jiri Jarosik says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> needs more than <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> to make <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> great again]</b> Going from Derby to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a different pressure. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a phenomenon now and one of the biggest clubs in the world so this job won’t be easy. From the start he was in a difficult situation without being able to bring in players. They have gone with a young team. If they want to compete for the title, I think they need some players with more experience because <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is very difficult. They have become inconsistent which is something that comes with youth and the quality of the league. A lot of guys have come <b>[back]</b> from smaller clubs on loan to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will scout well ahead of the transfer window having not signed anyone yet. I think they need more than one player in <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Hakim Ziyech</a> because they need a bench that can help them compete for a title too. They need to be stronger to win the biggest games<br /><br />Frank is a legend in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history. We played in the same position so we were rivals and I think he began the big part of his career in the moments around the time that I came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He was in a great moment with him and <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> growing up as players. They went on to spend a long time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He was always balanced in his performance which is very important when you are his kind of player. He has become a coach and I wish him all the best. It was difficult in this moment to say that he would be a coach. Everything changed now and these guys I played with at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> want to stay in football. We don’t know anything different, that’s why we stay in football and maybe people missed being in full stadium. That’s why you stay in the game and for all our generation in football, that’s everything. That’s what attracts our generation to be coaches<br /><br /><b>[He admits <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was key to the Blues beating <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to sign him from CSKA Moscow]</b> In December, I had the first call from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before my move in January. I was thinking about moving to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. But when I heard <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were interested in me, they were the first in my head. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> knew me for a few years because we played against Porto when I was at my first club Sparta Prague in the group stage of the Champions League. I had played a very good game against his Porto. I heard from that moment that he wanted me. Then CSKA Moscow played <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the Champions League and I played very well against him again. That’s it. He remembered me well and then I signed for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That’s true that my team helped <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> grow into what it is today. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are one of the best teams in the world. When I came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, all the players had big careers. At that moment, they were a winning machine. Now, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are not as good at winning titles like before despite still having very good players. Every player from left-to-right in the team were amazing. They were very hungry and that’s why we were winning titles and the top team in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history. Everything at this time was perfect; it was great for me to share a dressing room. To train with them was an amazing experience. The trophies were a bonus but every day was great- <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a>, <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>. What a team. The guys were perfect. They had strong mentalities and were winners on and off the pitch. Terry in particular set that tone. He spoke with everyone whether a star of the team or not. I think that was very important for us and I respected him a lot<br /><br /><b>[The Covid-19 crisis sees Jarosik home with his family in Prague but he is aiming to complete his final qualifications to get his Uefa Pro Licence]</b> I have been in football all my life and I know nothing different. Now, studying my Pro Licence, I hope everything will work out well with football and by next season I am looking to be a manager. I am hoping for that. I can go anywhere so I just need to make sure my family follow me. My dream at first is to become a first-team coach and then to work in Spain. Spain was important for my football and life so that’s why I want to try working in Spain</p>
