It may be strange to describe the US as a developing market but if you look at the stats from the World Cup, the NBC numbers were two and a half times the previous Fox and ESPN <b>[World Cup]</b> numbers and despite finishing seventh we were the No1 most watched team.

Success means winning trophies. That target has never changed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. The success on the business side underpins the success on the football side. Much of the progress made around that investment - the academy, the recruitment department and the training ground facilities - is behind the scenes and therefore isn’t immediately apparent to those on the outside looking in. We’ve materially expanded our recruitment department to improve efficiency and productivity. Recruitment decisions are worked on day to day by this department and the manager and his team. Along with the commitments we made to Ole and his staff in March, this has given us the building blocks for success. Whilst we’re confident this investment will deliver results, it’s important that we’re patient, while Ole and his team build for the future. We will continue to focus on the long-term strategy and won’t be influenced by short-term distractions<br /><br />The club was linked with hundreds of players, almost all without foundation. We approached the window in a focused and disciplined way. Our new signings joined a strong squad that included <b>[players with]</b> new contracts. We’re optimistic for the future. The sale and loaning of players has allowed the manager to involve more young players and lay the foundations and a culture. Regarding the speculation around the head of football, we are continually reviewing and looking at the potential to evolve our structure on the football side. Much of the speculation around this type of role revolves around recruitment - an area that we’ve evolved in recent years. As we’ve already mentioned, we feel the players we’ve signed in the summer demonstrate this approach is the right one. The ethos on attacking football is the right way forward</p>

  <p><b>[Woodward defends <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> recruitment policy from ‘insulting myth’]</b> There is a myth that we have non‑football people making football decisions, and it’s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club. Many of the senior staff on the football side of the club have been in their roles for over 10 years. Some of our scouts have worked with us for more than 25 years. We’ve expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this now runs in an efficient and productive way. Player recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and by the first-team manager and his staff, not by senior management<br /><br />What’s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side. We are an incredible 141-year footballing institution with all that history, all that legacy, all that tradition and that tradition of success. That can never, ever change. We need to keep that protected<br /><br /><b>[Despite United’s poor results, Woodward praised <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s influence on the squad since he replaced <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> at the helm]</b> Ole has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years. He is building a squad that respects the club’s history, in which players work hard and respect their teammates. No one is bigger than the club. The changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad, but it’s also a squad with the players and the culture that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.<br /><br />Ole’s vision maps exactly to the core three football objectives we have: we must win trophies, we must play attacking football and we must give youth its chance. The middle section of last season, after Ole’s arrival, feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be. We saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants</p>

  <p><b>[Woodward: <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> not for sale with Glazers committed long term]</b> Based on what I see, they’re in it for the long term. With regards to offers or asking prices, my understanding is that there have been no discussions for a price for the club or anything like that. Every conversation we have is based on the long-term. The debt is a long-term, structured and similar to some other football clubs. It’s a fixed amount for a fixed period of time which results in it being fairly cheap to service. It’s just under two per cent of our annual revenue each year, so it doesn’t really have any impact on us.<br /><br />If you look at the way the approach changed under the Glazers for commercial activity, that has brought in an extra £2.5-£3 billion. We have spent a lot of money on players. We are financially strong. We are self-sustaining. We don’t have an umbilical cord that we are concerned about. There’s negativity about us doing sponsorship deals but they allow us to do things in the transfer market which other clubs struggle to do. We absolutely feel we are on the right track to getting back to winning trophies.<br /><br /><b>[Woodward’s own position at <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> has been the subject of increasing criticism]</b> I understand the scrutiny; it’s part of the job. And I don’t want to be famous and can’t be mates with the players. But we have to do everything we possibly can to get back to winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

You can roll a dice in the Champions League, you need luck to win that, but we have to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We need to do well commercially to do well on the pitch, we also need to spend what we get more consistently than we have been doing, but we’re on much firmer ground with recruitment.<br /><br />I understand the scrutiny; it’s part of the job.

Despite some of the narrative around the club at the moment, I feel that we are on the right track to get back to that point <b>[winning the league]</b> but we are going to have to be patient<br /><br /><b>[He added on the club’s vision]</b> Winning; playing attacking football with players that have an ‘x-factor’; and giving youth a chance. Added to that, we want players to come in who respect their team-mates, the club, the history. They must understand they are creating a legacy by coming to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Nobody is bigger than the club. There should be both a humbleness and an arrogance.<br /><br />Ole has brought a lot of the discipline back. Whatever manager we have has to buy into that philosophy and Ole is a walking, talking version of that. Let’s play this out with Ole in terms of the cultural reboot. It <b>[appointing <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> permanently]</b> wasn’t pivotal to it <b>[finishing top four]</b> one way or another. I want to take a long-term view - Ole was hired with the long-term view that he will be successful<br /><br />Recruitment isn’t everything, but it’s pretty close. You have to get that right and we haven’t done that consistently enough in the past. I want to try and explain how we have evolved it. We have changed the recruitment structure so that it doesn’t look anything like it did a few years ago. We have invested a lot. We’re confident that we have a disciplined process that works. That’s partly evidenced by what happened in the summer, but we need to judge over a period of time</p>

  <p><b>[Ed Woodward insists that he has no input in transfer business outside of signing off the money, with <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> currently in the process of identifying January targets]</b> The decisions related to recruitment are all taken by football experts. My involvement is signing off the money. The manager has a veto on a player - we would never sign a player the manager wouldn’t want because he wouldn’t play him. But we also feel the recruitment department, the football experts, should have a veto too.<br /><br />I don’t get involved in recruitment like people think I do. There’s a myth that I look at YouTube and choose players. I don’t. Having an eye for players is an art. I have no interest in doing that. I just want to have a disciplined process because if you are spending a lot of money on a player you have to make sure you get more right than wrong. Where I get involved is that I have to sign off the money, yet when you have target one, two or three from your process I feel fine going after the number one target and, if it’s not to be him, then number two or three<br /><br /><b>[Woodward added on the changes which have been made]</b> The system wasn’t set up in the right way. Twelve scouts reporting to one chief scout was more set up to say no - too many exceptions to the process were made historically while this was being fixed. We also have to hold our hands up and say that recruitment wasn’t at its best in recent years. We feel that we now know who our best scouts are. The idea is to recruit in a closed environment, rather than listening to the press or getting distracted by conflicting agents’ claims. We try and make cold decisions based on information. Judge the recruitment department in the coming windows where hopefully we can get a team to be at the level we want to be<br /><br />The manager sits down in September - so Ole has already done this for the next cycle - and told the experts the positions that he wants to recruit in and the characteristics relating to those players<br /><br />Agents use us to ramp up interest in their player sometimes. That’s why we’re linked to about 200 players a year sometimes. That gets everyone excited and I understand why that happens, but it’s difficult for us to say no to deny speculation. If we start doing that by saying ‘no comment’ when it’s a ‘no’, then that means ‘yes’ - then the minute we don’t say anything means we’re interested and we might not want it public that we’re interested.<br /><br />We also don’t want to give hard noes when things could evolve. We want to keep things tight, to do what’s best for the club. But when a player keeps popping up <b>[in the media]</b> and we’re not interested, it’s very frustrating. What sometimes happens is that we do have a player in an agreed position, but his club refuse to sell - <b>[because of that]</b> the player then uses that to get a new contract - we don’t waste time, we’re more robust</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> chief Woodward warns transfer market won’t be ‘business as usual’ for his side]</b> Nobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be ‘business as usual’ for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer. As ever our priority is the success of the team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality. On this basis, I cannot help feeling that speculation around transfers of individual players for hundreds of millions of pounds this summer seems to ignore the realities that face the sport.</p>

I would say that once we have that visibility of a path through the crisis and coming out of the other side to relative normality, then, of course, we aim to remain highly competitive in the market. As I said before and I’ve said this many times, we remain committed to backing Ole to win trophies. That’s our core objective as a club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward warns there’s still ‘huge uncertainty’ over <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return]</b> I think we all agree that we want supporters back watching football at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> as soon as possible. That can only happen when we are advised it is safe to do so, and clearly the government has a major say in that<br /><br />No decisions have been made yet but we think it is possible that the initial games, particularly the ones related to finishing or trying to complete this season, will probably have to be played behind closed doors - but that isn’t confirmed yet. We’re not necessarily happy about that, clearly football requires our fans in the stadium for it to be complete, but public health must come first. We’ve got to have clarity on what the future holds. What will happen with the remainder of this season? What is the impact on next season? Is it behind closed doors or in front of fans? What’s the impact on broadcast deals, sponsorship deals? What’s the impact on domestic cups<br /><br />From a UK perspective there is still huge uncertainty. There was an interesting question about competitive games overseas, I’ve not heard anything on that and I would expect our remaining domestic games to be played in England</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> executive vice-chairman Woodward ‘optimistic’ over <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return in June]</b> We are optimistic it will soon be possible to resume playing football and our men’s first team has commenced a phased return to training this week with rigorous medical protocols in place to manage risk. Subject to government and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> shareholder approval, with input from medical staff and players, we anticipate domestic games could restart in June. Furthermore, all indications from <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> are that the culmination of the Europa League could be during August. We remain in constant dialogue with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> about the next steps towards returning to playing while continuing to protect the health of our players, staff and wider public. We are encouraged by the return of the German <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, the first major European league to restart last weekend, with the successful completion of nine matches all behind closed doors<br /><br />Our results reflect the partial impact the pandemic has had on the club. While clearly the greater impact will be in the current quarter and likely beyond. We remain firmly optimistic for the long-term prospects for the club and for our exciting young team once we have worked our way through what is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary and testing periods in the 142-year history of Manchester United<br /><br />There are still profound challenges ahead for football as a whole and it is safe to say it will not be business as usual for some time. Our club is built on solid foundations, we remain one of the most popular teams and one of the most followed and we have created a strong financial base. However, the repercussions of the pandemic are now being felt widely across the footballing community. Not just by clubs but by players, broadcasters, sponsors and many other stakeholders. We have a shared interest in protecting our sport during this period. It’s crucial we work together in a period of solidarity to maximise our chances of coming back strongly when the pandemic recedes. We must recognise that this pandemic will not disappear overnight and the world which is emerging will be different to how it was before. That will create challenges for football, like many other industries, but also brings an opportunity for innovation and creativity as we explore options for resuming football in ways that still protect public health</p>

Since the start of the pandemic, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and our foundation have provided assistance to hospitals, charities and schools in our communities, as well as support for frontline workers and vulnerable fans. These actions reflect our core values as a club and the resilience through adversity that we have demonstrated many times throughout our long history and will do so again to weather these current challenges. In that spirit, we look forward to the team safely returning to the pitch and building on the exciting momentum that Ole and the players had previously achieved, while taking all necessary steps to protect public health. Our thoughts remain with all those affected during this unprecedented time</p>

The lack of Champions League football and the impact of Covid-19 has been seen in United’s latest financial results. They’re poorer than they would be normally but they’re not horrendous. They’ve still got a huge wage bill to pay and without matches there won’t be as much money coming in, so they will be expecting a big deterioration in the fourth quarter<br /><br />No question, the economic ramifications from this global pandemic will continue to resonate for years to come, but we remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for the sponsorship business and our ability to remain a leader within the market</p>

  <p><b>[Ed Woodward salutes <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> supporters ahead of closed-door <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> return]</b> On the pitch, there is no escaping the reality that the coming months are going to be difficult for everyone in football and we are no exception. However, our club’s foundations are solid and, provided we stick together and manage our resources carefully, we will come through this period with our strength intact - thanks in large part to the loyalty of our fantastic supporters. As a club, we say ‘thank you’ through the ‘United for the Heroes’ banner displayed in the <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> Stand, as well as the NHS logo on the players’ shirts. You will also see powerful anti-racism messages, on the players’ shirts and in the stands, and we are proud to be uniting with our players and the rest of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> behind this crucial cause<br /><br />Diversity, inclusion and the fight against racism are at the core of our values as a club whose support spans racial and cultural boundaries. This has been a long-standing commitment from the club, as part of our All Red All Equal campaign and our support for groups such as Kick It Out<br /><br />The breadth and diversity of our fan base is demonstrated by over 40,000 supporters from 193 countries who submitted their pictures for the spectacular fan mosaic, which will be on show in the stands for the first time tonight. We hope the mosaic will provide inspiration to the team as a reminder of the hundreds of millions cheering them on from home<br /><br />As a banner in the Stretford End tonight declares, quoting <a href="matt-busby.html">Sir Matt Busby</a>, ‘football is nothing without fans,’ and we can’t wait for you to return to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> as soon as it is safe to do so</p>
