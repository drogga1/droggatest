  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> First of all, he is an incredible man-manager. To be that, you have to know who you’re dealing with, and he knew everyone, every single player at the club, every parent’s name, everyone who is employed at the club, despite the circulation of players during the summer. That’s a very big skill, and a very important thing for him in order to do his job. When I retired, every now and then I went to watch training, and he was very happy for old players to come back. He’d be walking around with his hands in his pockets, watching training, and would say, ‘Come, let’s go and watch the kids.’ We’d watch the Under-17s, and he’d point to a player and say, ‘That player over there, he’s going to play in the League Cup 18 months from now. We’ll give him a game then, and he’ll probably be on the bench once, maybe twice.’ So he would be planning 18 months into the future. One year he let <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a>, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a>, and Andrei Kanchelskis leave in the same summer, and he didn’t bring anyone in. He said, ‘My responsibility is that if I want to bring kids through, I have to give them an opportunity to play, so I’ve got to make space in the team for them. <b>[. . .]</b> That’s knowing your players. He knows when players have to be moved on before anybody else, even the player themselves, and he knows who is going to replace them, and that’s one of his major talents. Then he has the ability to evolve and develop himself; over the course of 25 years you can’t be the same guy</p>

A couple of games in I am thinking, ‘This guy is made for Manchester United ‘. He is not fazed about anything. Everyone will agree in the World Cup he played every game, just got on with it and was arguably was one of the best players in the English team. He brings all that and an incredible ability to bring the ball forward. It is something you either have or don’t have and very few centre halves have that ability. For some people he looks a bit awkward but I have got used to him and know exactly what he will do and think he will do very well. He is going to bring stability in defence. He is a very calm, cool customer. There is nothing erratic about him. You had all the big clubs looking at him and I felt he would go all summer because of the money involved</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says David de Gea is staying at Manchester United]</b> David was a great signal that we start off with arguably our best performer over the last five years. We have tied him down, he is staying and now we move on and build on that<br /><br />We had a few guys who have been instrumental like Antonio Valencia and Ander Herrera who have left with their contracts running out. They have had to be replaced by Manchester United youth which is a very position thing. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has come in and Daniel James who are good exciting young British players. They are still a bit raw but massively talented and that is proper Man United DNA. You find those kind of players and develop them.<br /><br />I also know Ole has worked really hard on getting the players fitter than they have ever been and that is going to stand them in good stead. That is going to be a big difference to last season and the season before. I think it is about longevity - duration not only in games but in the course of the season as well. The fitter you are, the longer you last. It is an interesting season and I am really looking forward to it. We all want Man United to do a lot better. I am very positive we will see a big improvement. But I don’t think you change from being one to the next over the course of just one summer</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says uncertainty around <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>’s future could have come to hurt Manchester United]</b> Finally he signed the contract because it’s been one of those situations that if it drags on too long it will actually hurt the football club. It gets to a point where you say, ‘Either you sign the contract or you leave but you tell us because we need to move on’. The situation at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is that we know quite a few of the players in the squad have to leave for the club to progress and we need to bring more players in, different kinds of players. I think the manager needs to know, ‘Is David staying or is he going? Because I have to move on as a manager and we have to move on’, but he signed and that’s great. He’s been, I think, in the last six years unquestionably the best player we’ve had, so it’s nice. That box is now ticked and Ole can start looking at other areas he needs to improve in</p>

Even when Ole made the substitutions and put <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> further forward, not a lot happened. I agree there were two very good passes from <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in this game but it’s two, it’s not 15 and I kind of see that as a problem because he takes up so much attention and it kind of feels like he’s the problem child in this team. When you have someone who takes up so much attention from newspapers, from when we talk about him, we need to understand what is his role. What is it that he’s going to do for this <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team? At the moment, I’m kind of confused and I don’t understand it. <br /><br />I think the players are good enough around him but he wasn’t looking enough for the ball, he was hiding a little bit in the first half. In the second half it was a little bit better. He’s not playing in the same way he did last season for sure. I think they need to find out what his role is and how <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should play with him in the team and then it should be communicated to everyone. You know the 75,000 here, they’re not really too happy with him to be fair, you kind of hear that around that people don’t like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> that much because he doesn’t do much for the team.

I kind of feel for Ole, I think he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. There’s not really a lot he can do. The fact is that it’s a very average squad of players that he’s got. To go to Bournemouth and to, not be bullied off the pitch, but at times played off the pitch, and with only one shot on target, it’s bad.<br /><br />We’ve all experienced games like that where it’s not coming off for you and stuff like that. But what really gets to me is the work rate - the work rate is just not good enough. You play for Man United, you have to work hard for 90 minutes or however long the game is and there are certain players in there who come off the pitch <b>[and]</b> there’s no sweat on them, they look like they don’t care if those lose the ball or lose a tackle and don’t get the ball. For me, that’s not good enough<br /><br /><b>[United did spend over the summer in an effort to aid their collective cause, but there were also plenty of outgoings at Old Trafford]</b> He definitely didn’t get the transfer window done in the way that he wanted to.

He will remember the last bit of the game and maybe take that over more minutes. I think if he watches it back I think he’ll change his mind a little bit. They didn’t exploit the little pockets of space before very late in the game. But full credit to them for carrying on and continuing to believe it and just waiting for that one opportunity that came in the 72nd minute. From then on, I actually said it was going to be five because it was that kind of game when you’re suddenly a team that takes over and then you can score more goals.

He needs better concentration<br /><br />I think the disappointment of not going to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at that time, feeling like he’s caught up here, rebuilding the team, insecurity in defence - there is a lot of things going on. But I think with his experience that he should be the one calming things down and ensuring every easy thing was dealt with. In certain situations, that hasn’t happened and people start to focus on that. When people pinpoint something on your performances, you start to think about it and start to believe you have a problem. That might be why we see <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> in these situations</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is right to avoid making bold Champions League predictions at Manchester United]</b> He’s <b>[Solskjaer]</b> tried to not put it out there that we are chasing Champions League or that he’s setting targets that might be unrealistic. He’s saying we take it game by game. He’s said his grand plan is to play a younger team and get a younger team ready for next season. He’s doing that. He’s getting players at 18, 19, 20 years of age, he’s giving them game time so that they will be ready and have that experience. Then we will have to see what happens in the summer. Of course he wants to be in the Champions League but I don’t think he can go in an interview and say that because it is a big call, there are a lot of teams there</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says ‘Far too early’ to replace De Gea with <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> at Man Utd]</b> Would anyone seriously consider not having <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> in goal and put <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> in now? There’s no doubt about Henderson’s potential, but he’s played one season at a club who has had an unbelievable run in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Henderson will need to show another season, like he’s just come through, and then another one, and another one, in order to convince everyone that he is the right guy. There’s a really big difference between being the No.1 at Bramall Lane and being the No.1 at Old Trafford, a really big difference. Even just being a player at those two clubs. I have seen a lot of guys come into Old Trafford with great reputations, goalscorers, and they haven’t been able to do what they promised to do, with performances and talent. That’s simply because the pressures at Old Trafford are different, just different, you know<br /><br />Just as an example, if Henderson makes a mistake - and I can only remember one he made against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - it, ‘Oh yeah, but he’s young and talented and blah blah blah’, because he plays for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>. If he makes that mistake at Old Trafford, for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, then it’s headlines and it’s all week until he plays the next game, where they question his ability to be the No.1. The pressures, the outside pressures, are so different. If you make a mistake playing for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, well, fine, it’s what happens, you’re not expected to win every game. But you are when you’re playing for the bigger clubs. So, let’s see how he develops and keep an eye on him. But it’s far too early. So the question: De Gea or Henderson? There’s really only one answer to that</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is doing an ‘amazing job’ at Old Trafford]</b> I think Ole has been absolutely fantastic. Fingers crossed that everyone in the boardroom and the ownership circle see the same thing, that they’re happy with what got and don’t see the need to change to yet another big-name manager. We have a big-name manager. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is one of the biggest names in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s history, so we don’t need anybody else. Ole had them going really well. It was 11 games undefeated, before everything was closed down. It was a big shame, because the job that Ole’s done, it really is an amazing job.<br /><br />I don’t think he was given the best squad of players to do precisely what he wanted to do. He realised very quickly it was going to take time and he spent that time wisely. The players he knew for sure that had to go, I think most of them have gone. I think the players he brought in were good, in the sense of what he wanted to do. So I’m actually looking at United being very successful this season, with the introduction of new players and still in touching distance of Champions League qualification</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has done a tremendous job at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in a short space of time]</b> I think he’s done a tremendous job. I think he’s far exceeded my expectations on what could be done in a relatively short period of time, it has to be said. Basically what he’s taken over is six years of too many different directions. He’s taken over players that were with Sir Alex (Ferguson), he’s taken over players that were with (David) <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> and Louis Van Gaal and then (Jose) <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. All of them are different. They’re different in their approach, they’re different in the players they like. So he’s not really had an opportunity to build what he wants but he has. I think he has been helped by circumstances for absolutely sure but he’s given opportunities to players who you always thought that they were good, they could do the job, but because of the lack of patience or understanding of the players’ ability<br /><br />Getting into the Champions League, that is a massive leap towards <b>[winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in the future]</b>. Not getting into the Champions League is not a disaster because it’s another year of development and I don’t think there’s anything wrong in taking one step back to take two steps forward. But if we could manage to get into the Champions League, that would mean that the up-and-coming transfer windows will have a different feel to it because the best players in the world want to compete in the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel has described <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> as one of the great stories of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s season]</b> <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> has been, for me, absolutely instrumental in how well the club has done this season. He was always perfect for the club but he’s now been given playing time and the more time he’s been given, the more confidence he’s gained and for me, he’s been one of the great stories this season at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Of course it’s down to <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> but it’s down to Ole for giving him that confidence. I like that. I like the way he’s kind of introduced players that were already there but are now in the first team and are now playing well. He’s also brought all these values in. The players now know them. If you don’t share our values, there’s no place for you here. So you have to live up to his values. And he’s bringing in his own culture and you can see it and it’s there and it’s brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has labelled <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a>’s signing as one of the most positive surprises ever]</b> I think he’s been one of the most positive surprises ever. First of all his personality around the club, he’s been a revelation around the club. Everybody has tagged on and liked him straight away. When you have that kind of personality, it changes the whole team. Someone who brings a laugh into the dressing room, rather than coming in grumpy or not saying anything. It changes the dynamics, and what he’s done on the pitch, that really has surprised me. I was kind of confused, because it was last day and it looked as if they were just needing and looking to bring someone in - but that’s not the truth, and what he’s done is just fantastic. Another thing as well, someone like him, all of his life the only thing he really wanted to achieve was to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Now that has been cut short by circumstances that are out of everybody’s control. For what he’s done, in the very few games he’s ended up playing, it would have been heart-breaking if that was to stop.<br /><br />I think he might not be a starter but he might be somebody you can throw into the mix. You’ve seen him in the Europa League, like Ole himself, he can come on and change a game. Nobody, nobody, knows that better than the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager. The value of having someone on the bench who can change a game, so I’m really happy about that.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel claims to be absolutely convinced that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> will remain at the club]</b> I’m absolutely convinced he wants to stay.

One thing is how he’s portrayed in the media for what he does and what he says himself, and another thing is what his agent is doing. And a completely different thing is what it’s really like. He wanted to come back to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he wanted to come back. And he has got, like any other player at that level in the world, he’s got his pride. And I don’t think he wants to leave. I don’t think so.<br /><br />I think when Ole came, we straight away saw with Ole’s guidance and his knowledge with Paul, we saw precisely what he can give us. And that’s a lot. Unfortunately I don’t think he’s gotten great representation. He’s such a valuable asset so it’s great to shift him to another club, because that’s a lot of money to make. I think that if you have somebody telling you that in your ear at some point you’re bound to be confused. You’re a young player. All he should be content and focused on is playing. I hope with this period of being out of the game, I hope that with Ole’s management skills, he’s going to come back and love playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.</p>
