  <p><b>[on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> First of all, he is an incredible man-manager. To be that, you have to know who you’re dealing with, and he knew everyone, every single player at the club, every parent’s name, everyone who is employed at the club, despite the circulation of players during the summer. That’s a very big skill, and a very important thing for him in order to do his job. When I retired, every now and then I went to watch training, and he was very happy for old players to come back. He’d be walking around with his hands in his pockets, watching training, and would say, ‘Come, let’s go and watch the kids.’ We’d watch the Under-17s, and he’d point to a player and say, ‘That player over there, he’s going to play in the League Cup 18 months from now. We’ll give him a game then, and he’ll probably be on the bench once, maybe twice.’ So he would be planning 18 months into the future. One year he let <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a>, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a>, and Andrei Kanchelskis leave in the same summer, and he didn’t bring anyone in. He said, ‘My responsibility is that if I want to bring kids through, I have to give them an opportunity to play, so I’ve got to make space in the team for them. <b>[. . .]</b> That’s knowing your players. He knows when players have to be moved on before anybody else, even the player themselves, and he knows who is going to replace them, and that’s one of his major talents. Then he has the ability to evolve and develop himself; over the course of 25 years you can’t be the same guy</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Schmeichel says the arrival of Jose Mourinho has been fantastic for Manchester United]</b> I think it’s been fantastic, I expected it to be another bumpy year. Jose has inherited a squad of players and he will have had to assess every one of them. He is doing that quicker than I thought he would have done. Plus, the four additions in the summer <b>[Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Paul Pogba]</b>, they have all been really good. We are getting back to a Manchester United way of playing, which I didn’t expect so quickly, so I am optimistic for the future.<br /><br />I think Jose has always tried to protect the lead but it is not in our DNA to <b>[do so]</b>, it’s to get number two, number three and number four. <b>[But]</b> he has sent the players out to get two, three and four. It’s great to watch and hopefully it’s going to be evolved and developed. I would be very disappointed if we are not top four. There is a lot of progress, the team is shaping up and the club is getting back into its own rhythm, its own groove</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho will lead Manchester United to a Premier League title if given time and patience by supporters]</b> He’s been at great clubs. Real Madrid, Inter Milan. He won the Champions League with Porto. Three Premier League titles with Chelsea. He’s done so many great things in football. But Manchester United is a different level to anything. The scrutiny, the traditions and the history that we have. We have very proud traditions. Every single day, we respect our history. We finished runners-up last season from fifth the campaign before. We’re straight into the Champions League this year, we won the Europa League and we’ve been in two FA Cup finals. This is great. These are very positive things. When we give him time and patience, when we understand this is a period in which we have to develop, we can win the Premier League.<br /><br />You can’t just walk into Old Trafford and you’re there. There’s so much to get used to. Every single place that he goes, he will not meet one or two United fans, but big numbers. They live and breathe Man United. This is what the other clubs don’t have in those kind of numbers</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s mind remains somewhere else]</b> Paul’s come back from the World Cup having won it, he’s come back very early and it’s really difficult. I’ve obviously never been all the way to the final but I went to the quarter-final and to come back with very little break, very little holiday after you’ve been on this incredible high - you find yourself in this state that’s been going on for three or four weeks and then it’s gone. You completely deflate and to inflate yourself again it just takes time. Unfortunately, the football calendar is such that even the guys all the way to the final won’t have much of a break. Hopefully later on in the season there is an opportunity to give those players just a little bit of a breather - it is so difficult, honestly. Your mind is somewhere else, you look at the 11 months ahead of you and think, ‘This is the steepest mountain’ and at some point you need to just get away from it. Hopefully he will get that.</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes should have been given more time at Manchester United]</b> If we should have any regrets as Manchester United, that is that we only gave David Moyes seven months. I think we should have given him more time, accepted that results weren’t going to be the way we hoped they would be and that playing would be a little bit different. I believe he would have grown into that role. He has the personality and he had so many things he needed to learn and he didn’t have anybody to learn them from. He was left to run the football department on his own. I think that really would have helped him <b>[keeping Mike Phelan]</b>, had he had someone with that kind of experience. But I also understand where he’s coming from. He did think that he brought that experience with Phil Neville so he had someone there<br /><br />I don’t think he wanted someone there who had worked with Sir Alex. I can understand that, but maybe when you look back maybe that was a mistake. But from the club’s perspective we should never, ever have dismissed him. That left us into making rash decisions, so we bring in a name and that went completely wrong. Had we brought in Mourinho instead of Louis van Gaal, I’m sure history would have told that it would have been better. It would have been so much better for him to come in at that point rather than after Van Gaal. There were too many things that happened, too many players brought in that didn’t suit him and possibly didn’t suit Man United as well. But we go back and look at our history, we look at the number of years from Sir Matt <b>[Busby]</b> stopping and retiring in the 70s and all the way to ‘86. It still took Fergie from ‘86 to ‘93 to seal the first championship so United is the kind of club that will always bounce back. This time we just hope it’s a little bit quicker</p>

He looked like a small boy and he played like a small boy - and these are Sir Alex Ferguson’s words - with big hands. He played Chelsea and he snapped into character with a couple of really incredible saves. From that moment on he has developed incredibly.<br /><br />His physicality has changed. I think now if you ask him, he’s there, exactly where he wants to be. He’s very often in the right position to make these kind of saves and he does it time and time again, and it’s very impressive</p>

  <p><b>[Schmeichel calls for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> stay at Man Utd]</b> He must be top candidate now. I think with Ole it is kind of a free ride because he’s only there on a temporary basis, but he’s proven - and the Liverpool game was key for me - that his way of thinking, he’s a top, top, top manager. I mean, we were trying to think about a game where three, actually four, players get injured in the first 25 minutes and you have to regroup. I can’t remember anyone ever being faced with that challenge and I thought he came out of that smelling of roses<br /><br />I didn’t even see the announcement of Ole coming - it was a really big surprise that they picked him. I thought they’d go somewhere else. You know, some of the former players who have had bigger clubs - who have been at the club but are from different, other parts of Europe. It was kind of a clever move because Ole’s worked with <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, he’s worked with <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard when they were in the reserves and they have huge respect for Ole. Everyone has huge respect for Ole. His potential as a coach was very, very <b>[clear]</b> early on. It was very clear he would be a very good coach<br /><br />I mean, I’d do anything for this club, of course I’d be silly not to do that, you know? I’d be silly not to say, ‘of course I want to do it’. Chasing the job, I think it’s different. I think I wouldn’t do that. My life and the work I do has great variety and it’s a difficult one to let go, if you know what I’m saying? But of course if I was asked to do a job for the club, I would. I think we all would</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea is not the problem at Manchester United]</b> I am very, very disappointed with the short-sightedness of everyone. Every person who feels they have a right to comment on everything on social media. I urge people to have a look at the team he is playing in - look at the confidence of the team. Then have a look at what he’s done in the same kind of teams over the last four or five years. He’s been brilliant. Then he’s deemed to make a few mistakes - okay, one or two - but it happens. It happens to every goalkeeper. There are only two games left so there is no discussion about whether he’s not playing. I’m disappointed with people who this easily jump on someone who has been this good. Very, very disappointed.<br /><br />Without David de Gea, can you imagine where Manchester United would have been? This is the question I have to ask. I cannot blame him for anything. I think he has been absolutely fantastic and I wish people could just let him go. He’s not the problem. There are other problems that need to be addressed</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City may have invested millions in an incredible squad]</b> It underlines how special our achievement was. I’m not going to hide behind us being fantastic and really deserving to win. When you look at how we ended up winning all three, we were very good, we worked very hard, we knew exactly what we had to do. But so did Arsenal. They were equally as good, they knew exactly what to do. They worked exactly as hard as we did and between our team and their team there was nothing between us. Nothing. It all comes down to which way you hit the post. Do you hit it on the inside or the outside, does it go in or does it go out? At times we rode our luck. This is how you can put our achievement into perspective, to look at this Manchester City side and think why are they not winning everything because it is such an incredible team? It is extraordinary with the players they have in the team. Everyone. Even when <b>[Guardiola]</b> makes five changes you don’t even think about the players who are not playing because they are this good. To be able to make five changes and not suffer in the way you play, that is really unheard of in football. So why are they not winning?<br /><br />Whenever the luck was distributed it always fell our way. You will not get anywhere if you are not a great team. It’s simple. If you are not a good team you will never get to the final day of the Premier League season or the final of the FA Cup. But we were competing against Arsenal. Arsenal were one of the best teams I ever competed against. Man for man we were the same. We had the same strengths. We were different players, but the same strength, height, quality in every position. I think to this day there was nothing between us. Really, I don’t think there was. We just had two breaks in the <b>[FA Cup]</b> semi-final. <b>[Dennis]</b> Bergkamp missed a penalty and Ryan’s <b>[Giggs]</b> goal. vcccThat’s the difference in 180 minutes of high intensity, very dramatic football. So that’s my point. Everything, when we needed it to, it fell our way and that’s important</p>

We’ve seen his world-class quality and how do we get him to perform like that in this <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team? That’s something they’ve really got to work on</h4>

I kind of feel for Ole, I think he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. There’s not really a lot he can do. The fact is that it’s a very average squad of players that he’s got. To go to <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> and to, not be bullied off the pitch, but at times played off the pitch, and with only one shot on target, it’s bad.<br /><br />We’ve all experienced games like that where it’s not coming off for you and stuff like that. But what really gets to me is the work rate - the work rate is just not good enough. You play for Man United, you have to work hard for 90 minutes or however long the game is and there are certain players in there who come off the pitch <b>[and]</b> there’s no sweat on them, they look like they don’t care if those lose the ball or lose a tackle and don’t get the ball. For me, that’s not good enough<br /><br /><b>[United did spend over the summer in an effort to aid their collective cause, but there were also plenty of outgoings at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> He definitely didn’t get the transfer window done in the way that he wanted to. Not so much any players coming in because he brought some really good players in. I think he wanted a couple more players leaving, which also has an effect on his team</p>

As a fan, I now see that there is something there and I think the way that the game went, you can’t expect every game to be played brilliantly. With young players, you can expect them to be up and down in games and have some terrible, terrible games, but also have some brilliant ones. I really do think we saw some brilliance from some of the younger players. Swapping <b>[Daniel]</b> James over to the left seriously helped</p>

They didn’t exploit the little pockets of space before very late in the game. But full credit to them for carrying on and continuing to believe it and just waiting for that one opportunity that came in the 72nd minute.

There’s no doubt about Henderson’s potential, but he’s played one season at a club who has had an unbelievable run in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Henderson will need to show another season, like he’s just come through, and then another one, and another one, in order to convince everyone that he is the right guy. There’s a really big difference between being the No.1 at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Bramall Lane</a> and being the No.1 at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, a really big difference. Even just being a player at those two clubs. I have seen a lot of guys come into <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> with great reputations, goalscorers, and they haven’t been able to do what they promised to do, with performances and talent. That’s simply because the pressures at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> are different, just different, you know<br /><br />Just as an example, if Henderson makes a mistake - and I can only remember one he made against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - it, ‘Oh yeah, but he’s young and talented and blah blah blah’, because he plays for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>.

The pressures, the outside pressures, are so different. If you make a mistake playing for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, well, fine, it’s what happens, you’re not expected to win every game.

Fingers crossed that everyone in the boardroom and the ownership circle see the same thing, that they’re happy with what got and don’t see the need to change to yet another big-name manager. We have a big-name manager. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is one of the biggest names in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s history, so we don’t need anybody else.

It was a big shame, because the job that Ole’s done, it really is an amazing job.<br /><br />I don’t think he was given the best squad of players to do precisely what he wanted to do. He realised very quickly it was going to take time and he spent that time wisely. The players he knew for sure that had to go, I think most of them have gone. I think the players he brought in were good, in the sense of what he wanted to do.
