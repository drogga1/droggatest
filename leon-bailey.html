Basically England was and still is my dream. And if I keep working hard, I’m sure it will work someday. The change to Bayer was just the right step for my development. I am happy here. And we have every chance to get into the Champions League. Europe is our big goal</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen striker Leon Bailey has indicated that he is prepared to make his long list of suitors wait]</b> Leverkusen is perfect for me. I want to develop and then I can take the next step. When I move to a big club, the people there will want to know me. I want to make a name for myself at the highest level.<br /><br /><b>[Bailey, though, is determined to put this title to bed, having helped the side into fourth in the Bundesliga but more notably into the semi-finals of the DFB Pokal]</b> If we go to the cup final, we’ll win it, I promise. That would be the end of Neverkusen</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Bailey’s agent and adopted father Craig Butler has revealed that the Bayer Leverkusen winger has rejected Jamaica’s latest international call-up]</b> Leon and his brother have received invitations to join Jamaica’s national team. I love my country and so do my boys. Unfortunately, my sons both declined the offer at this time. I have offered to show the JFF what I have learned from Belgium, Holland, Germany and even Slovakia on how to build a national program and fix the Jamaican football culture, but the JFF has refused to listen. Therefore, at this time, the boys will focus on their club careers. Leon and Kyle have British ancestry, Portuguese ancestry, have lived in Belgium and, in a few years, were Leon to stay in Germany, he too would qualify for Germany. My sons are only 20-years-old and Jamaica isn’t going to be playing in this summer’s World Cup. We have time. Each day that goes by it’s another day he could qualify for another country if he chooses. It shows him as a man of substance and a leader; not a fool that runs and bows at the hands of people who have been corrupted by the economic restraints they face.<br /><br />The only way the clubs can sell a player into England is to have national caps, and the governing body of the JFF selects the coaches of the national team and the technical directors. Leon, Kyle and all our players refused to leave and go to the clubs of these JFF board members when they were younger so they were never looked upon. Having never been capped for Jamaica, both players have the right to deny the request. The reason for this refusal to represent the Jamaica Football Federation is not because of a disassociation with me and the governing body of football. But because of a lack of a proper system of development and transparency in selecting players which has led to two of the most promising young men and others of high quality never ever before having been given the chance to represent their country at the youth or adult level</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen star Leon Bailey has suggested that there is concrete interest from both Chelsea and Liverpool in securing his signature]</b> There’s concrete interest. What I can say is that my full focus is on developing myself as a young player, and that’s what I’ll focus on. If a club wants me, my management and Bayer 04 will take care of it.<br /><br />We want to play for the title. Bayern Munich is one of the three strongest teams in the world for me, but in football you never know. We have to be focused, then we can do a lot with our quality to reach our goal</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Bailey has no regrets at having shunned the advances of Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in the past]</b> Manchester United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool - a lot of clubs were interested. But the most important thing as a pro is taking things a step at a time and not rushing to the top too quickly. Because once you get there, where do you go next? I believe the right timing is important, and it was the right moment to be at Bayer Leverkusen. They are a tremendous club with so much history. A lot of good players have come from there; they can get into the Champions League and are always doing well. So why not them? It was the perfect move for me and I’m happy I made it. My focus isn’t really on moving anywhere yet. I’m just about what’s happening right now rather than what could happen in the future. I’m still learning.<br /><br />Chelsea have been interested in me since I was maybe 14 or 15, but as a young player you want to start on a normal level and not just go there because of the name of the club. You want to develop in the right environment; around the right minds and mentality. Genk was right for me at that moment - I fitted right into the youth system perfectly. That’s where I wanted to start, so I went for it</p>

  <p><b>[What has happened to former €100m Man Utd target Leon Bailey?]</b> I’d already scored a free-kick against Sven Ulreich in the other corner <b>[last season]</b>. I knew that he often takes a small step towards the side covered by the wall, so I deliberately chose the other side. I caught the free-kick perfectly, it was a good trick.<br /><br />During our visit in Trencin we could see the club, its way of working and interesting results of developing young footballers. We believe we can continue in our development in Slovakia<br /><br />Genk feels like home. When I was away at other clubs, I didn’t have the support that I had at Genk. Hopefully I can become one of the best players they’ve ever produced. Leverkusen is well known for its development and the way football is played here is attractive. I like that<br /><br />Manchester United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool - a lot of clubs were interested, but the most important thing as a pro is taking things a step at a time and not rushing to the top too quickly<br /><br />I have to think about myself developing as a young player. My aim is to become the best player in the world. For me to achieve that, I need to be on the right path and I think, at this moment, choosing Jamaica is not the right path for me<br /><br />I am focused only on Leverkusen. I am happy where I am now and concentrated on developing well. Who knows what will happen in the future?</p>

  <p><b>[Phoenix from the flames - Leon Bailey back to his best after injuries and suspension]</b> Last season I had ups and downs. I had an injury towards the end, so it wasn’t my best season, but right now I’m really looking forward to the new season<br /><br />If you’ve been injured for so long and then see the red card in the first game back, it’s not a good feeling. There are moments when you doubt yourself. But I have people around me who support me 100 per cent. The coach always motivates me a lot, I motivate myself. And that helped me a lot to come back and help the team<br /><br /><b>[After the disappointment of last season, Bailey is aiming higher this season]</b> I see our team being at the highest level. We have, of all the teams right now, the best chance to be in the top three this year. The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> level is high right now and the points are very close, and even the teams that are behind are doing their best to beat teams ahead of them which makes it more complicated but it’s a very intense league and I’m happy to be a part of it.</p>
