  <p><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has just as much dedication as <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> but in a different way. We can certainly say that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has done everything within his power to be the best player in the world. He’s always been open about that: he wants other people to look at him and say he’s the greatest ever. He’s always had that focus, so he’s done it for external recognition. However, I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has the same drive; it’s just that his comes from within. He wants to be the best he can be. He pushes himself to be better, not so other people will say he’s the best, but so that he can be at peace with himself. I don’t think he needs that external gratification in the same way <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> does, but he still has that ruthless drive to push himself and get the very best out of himself. So, in terms of achieving that level of greatness and consistency, a lot of it comes down to the mentality of the player<br /><br />I think if you look at <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, I think it’s fair to say that he’s very conscience of his image, just like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>’s been very keen to exploit all of the opportunities that his popularity as a footballer affords him. But he’s maintained that awareness that all of this comes from what he does on the pitch. Football comes first. He’s not allowed his commercial life to detract from his professional life. I don’t think you could say the same about <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. If you look at <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s tweets, for example, it’s just brand, brand, brand. You wouldn’t know he’s a footballer the way he portrays himself at times. He’s a celebrity first and foremost, whereas <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> never seems to do anything that would jeopardise his ability to deliver on the pitch. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, too, had physical problems early in his career and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s medical team fairly quickly linked them to a poor diet and poor training regimes. So, they changed his diet, they convinced him to stop eating pizzas and drinking Coca-Cola, and he became fitter and overcome those fitness problems. But <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> enjoys the other things in life too much. He doesn’t have that ruthless commitment to his career, meaning he hasn’t been able to achieve <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s level of consistency</p>

  <p><b>[Andy West on Neymar]</b> Watching <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> week in, week out. when he was at his best at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he could do things that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> couldn’t. But <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> enjoys other things too much. He doesn’t have that same ruthless commitment to his career as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. If anything, his football career is a vehicle for his commercial career. So, he hasn’t been able to sustain his brilliance in the same way</p>
