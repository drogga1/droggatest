  <p><b>[Former Croatia international Ivan Juric, 44, told Sky Sport Italia he thought <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> had made an incident out of nothing]</b> Today there was nothing, no racist abuse. There was whistling and some goading against a great player. There was nothing. I am Croatian and people will say ‘sh<em>tty gypsy’, because unfortunately this is the trend in Italy. There is rampant racism, but today there was nothing. I don’t know why he reacted like that. Let’s not put it that way, it’s a lie. We don’t talk bullsh</em>t, if it had happened I would say so, and even if it was our own fans it would make me sick. But not today. When he scored the goal, there was a lot of goading. It was his problem, not ours<br /><br /><b>[Juric later added in his post-match press conference]</b> I think, on a human level, being racist is an absolute low. In this case, I don’t think anything has happened. I spoke with the fourth official, too. There was only teasing of a great player. I don’t want to say anything against Mario. It may have happened to him elsewhere.</p>
