  <p><b>[Gareth Bale remains a talismanic presence for Wales, but Tom Lawrence admits the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star cannot be expected to carry the expectations of a nation by himself]</b> We can’t leave it all down to Gareth himself, other players have got to chip in and help the team. There’s a few of us pushing for a start on Friday and we’ll all be looking forward to getting on the pitch. When he <b>[Bale]</b> is playing he’s one of the world’s best. Every time he can get on the pitch for Wales is a bonus. It always helps when you’re playing games. When you’re not match-fit it’s never easy to come and play games<br /><br /><b>[Lawrence missed out on that stunning run at Euro 2016 through injury]</b> It was a tough time. You’re looking forward to going to the Euros and for that to be halted by an injury is never nice. I’d love to play in a major tournament. It was my biggest learning curve in missing the Euros and dealing with that. Since then I’ve come on a long way. It would be nice to get in there again</p>

  <p><b>[Tom Lawrence has been named in the Wales squad for this month’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Slovakia and Croatia]</b> <b>[I picked them]</b> to give the team, the fans and the club something back. That’s why I did it. It still doesn’t change the fact of what we said as a club. They are not off the hook. We made it very clear that there will be disciplinary sanctions and actions for the players. But you have to move on after a certain time and they weren’t included in the last game. They are affected by it very much. I spoke the last few days a lot with the players and they were eager to go and play</p>

  <p><b>[Tom Lawrence would later release a statement of his own]</b> Following the events of the evening of the 24th September I wish to offer my sincere apologies to the football club; our Chairman, the manager, my team-mates and all our supporters for my indiscretions that night. It was a total error of judgement on my part, out of character for me and I am deeply disappointed in my behaviour and upset for my teammate and our Captain <a href="richard-keogh.html">Richard Keogh</a>. Going forward, I will make every effort to make amends by working diligently to give something back to our local community and I will strive to repay all the faith and support I have received from everybody during my time at the club in the best way I know how, on the field of play</p>
