  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan and East Bengal apprehensive on AFC meeting after AIFF snub]</b> Praful Patel met officials of both the clubs earlier this month <b>[6th May]</b> and promised them that by 25th May he will share with them the revised roadmap for the future of Indian football. There was a ray of hope after this. Suddenly, the bid document tenders were floated by the Indian Super League <b>[ISL]</b> authorities and the last date of submission was 25th May as well. Is that a coincidence or a farce of some kind, I do not know.<br /><br />We are yet to be given a roadmap and then came up the sudden intimation from the AIFF of a meeting convened at the Asian Football Confederation <b>[AFC]</b> headquarters on 7th June which will include various stakeholders of Indian football. We don’t know the confirmed list of stakeholders but it makes no sense in having some of the supposed stakeholders in that meeting from the names we are given to understand<br /><br />We are writing to the AIFF President and demanding him to share the roadmap first. Moreover, this is an issue between the clubs and AIFF, not an AFC issue, it’s purely a domestic issue so discuss it here. We will see about the meeting on 7th June and see how important it is. We will decide to go or not after we get his reply. We hope the AIFF solves it<br /><br />But, if all these issues are not sorted out, we are ready to whatever step necessary. But, we still hope for a solution. We are not thinking about a Plan-B but we will keep our state’s Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Minister of Sports Aroop Biswas abreast of whatever transpires between us and the AIFF<br /><br />So, the AIFF have defaulted us on the committment of a roadmap promised on 25th May. We will decide on our next step on the reply we get from the letter, which we will send latest by Monday</p>

  <p><b>[AIFF President Praful Patel has replied to the letter sent by Indian Football Association <b>[IFA]</b> Secretary Utpal Ganguli on Thursday]</b> Yes he has replied today. We <b>[IFA and the Kolkata clubs]</b> will meet in the next two-three days to discuss the contents of the reply. He <b>[Patel]</b> has responded to the points I had raised in it. We have to discuss with the clubs and then decide what is to be done further. He also requested me to persuade the clubs to attend the meeting and put their points of view across. He has also assured that if need be, he will certainly meet the clubs again.</p>

  <p><b>[I-League merger to AIFF by November]</b> I told them about the importance and heritage of the Bengal clubs and their contribution to Indian football. It will be unfair to put these clubs in the same bracket along with the newly formed franchise sides and take franchise fees. They deserve to play in the top tier league of the country whether ISL or I-League. The two officials were here to listen to our opinion about the future of Indian football.They will do a market survey now and on the basis of that they will prepare a draft report and submit it to the AIFF by November.</p>
