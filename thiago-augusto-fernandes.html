  <p><b>[Brazilian forward Thiago Augusto Fernandes said the decision to return to Felda United was not a hard one, as he and his family are happy in Malaysia]</b> I feel comfortable here, so when I heard they <b>[Felda United]</b> were interested in my return, I talked with my family. …I like Malaysia also, and so does my family, we feel well here.<br /><br />God gave me another opportunity to work hard, I want to help the team with goals and assists, <b>[so]</b> I hope God will help us<br /><br />I like Irfan and he’s doing a good job at Terengganu. <b>[But]</b> with this coach <b>[Sathianathan]</b> I feel good also. We’ve only trained for two or three days, but we’ve chatted and it went well. I hope I’ll be able to work hard for him also, to help the team<br /><br />Last year with Kedah was a very amazing experience, I enjoyed my time there, but they decided not to extend my contract. But this is football, you see. I hope Kedah do well, this is normal and I need to accept it. Thank God, now I’m here again at Felda and I’m happy</p>

  <p><b>[Felda United forward Thiago Augusto Fernandes is confident that his familiarity with their Malaysia Cup semi-finals opponents Kedah will be an asset to the Fighters in the two-legged tie]</b> I know <b>[Kedah]</b>, they haven’t changed many players except for two foreign players. They kept most of their local players, they are a good team but so are we. I think we’re going to have a good game this Sunday.<br /><br />It’s 50-50. Kedah are a good side and so are we, they work hard and so do we. Kedah are very good in the league and the Malaysia Cup, they have a good crowd behind them. But our team are also strong now. We will see two exciting matches<br /><br />A striker will always try to score, but I’ll help my team when defending and attacking. The important thing is to win</p>
