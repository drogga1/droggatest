  <p><b>[Javier Aguirre says if Liverpool star Mohamed Salah helps Egypt to Africa Cup of Nations glory then ‘no-one can keep the Ballon d’Or away from him’]</b> I see him so far struggling and struggling hard to win the Ballon d’Or. Why not? He is a Champions League winner with Liverpool. If he can lead Egypt to the African Cup of Nations, no one can keep the Ballon d’Or away from him.<br /><br /><b>[Aguirre has refuted suggestions that his side – who are yet to concede – have been short on firepower as a collective]</b> We have scored goals in 10 of the 11 matches since I have been in charge. It’s very difficult to win each match 5-0, very difficult<br /><br />All the players have the same idea when they play against Egypt – that they have nothing to lose. That’s the way they play against us – we are playing at home, we are the favourites, we have Salah, and they have nothing to lose. It’s very important that we know how to handle this situation</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt sacked head coach Javier Aguirre following their shock elimination in the round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations]</b> I am the one responsible <b>[for Egypt’s exit]</b>. I’m responsible for all the selections and the end results, but I’m still proud of this group of players. The next step will be decided after I meet with the Egyptian FA board tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[the manager believes the game was decided by his side’s inability to put away their scoring chances against Bafana Bafana]</b> The game was open and witnessed scoring chances; the only difference was that South Africa scored a goal that helped them to qualify. We also had our chances but couldn’t convert them</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> boss Javier Aguirre says <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> has always been a killer in the box]</b> It was 14 years ago. He was a small kid of 17 years old, alone in a big city. In Europe everything was different for him. He was a very intelligent guy, on the pitch, but he was short and the club paid €20m for him. I said to the club ‘you really paid that much for this guy because he doesn’t know where he is right now – he doesn’t know anything about <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, about Madrid, nothing’. He had to start from zero. In my opinion, he was not fit enough to play at the beginning of the league, in the pre-season I noticed that, so I said ‘what happens if we send him to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> B for one month?’ So he went there and trained with kids his own age and had pre-season with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> B. I was told that the media would kill me if they found out that I had sent him to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> B, so we started from the beginning with him. With Sergio, with the ball, he was the best of the team but without the ball, he watched the game like a fan! We told him that he had to help us without the ball, when the other team has the ball you have to run and recover it. We told him to move and find space, not wait for the ball, because he needs the ball into his feet. Then he did everything differently. We didn’t have to teach him how to play, that’s not the right word, but without the ball, we worked a lot on Sergio.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on when those predatory instincts were first identified]</b> Immediately. In the first week, the guy was different. One on ones, he is a killer in the box. He is a top, top player</p>

  <p><b>[Leganes manager Javier Aguirre has revealed <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> plans to resume the season on June 20 and finish on July 26]</b> We already have a start date for the league. On June 20, we will start <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and in five weeks we will be officially finished, on July 26. It will be played on Saturday-Sunday and Wednesday-Thursday, over 11 dates. <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> has just informed me officially and I am very happy about this, because we already have training scheduled. We start tomorrow. Luckily we have passed the tests<br /><br />The federation has just authorized five changes per game. It seems to me like the most sensible thing because how can you demand 90 minutes from the players when they have been stuck at home, between four walls for 80 days? To avoid injuries, get them in shape</p>
