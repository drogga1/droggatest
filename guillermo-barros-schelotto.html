  <p><b>[On Mexico faced Wales in the Rose Bowl on Monday]</b> It just so happened to coincide with my vacation and I wanted to come and see the game with my kids. I like the Mexican national team. I played against Mexico once in Los Angeles in the Coliseum in ‘99 playing with Argentina but I’ve never been able to come see a game. I came to see it and see Osorio’s team.<br /><br />When I played here, everyone played the same. Four defenders, four midfielder and two forwards. At the end, when I left after four years, you started seeing some changes. Now a lot is changing. You see Toronto playing with three at the back, Kansas City with three forwards, things you didn’t see, different teams using different tactics. That also helps players evolve and teams change<br /><br />Yes, without doubt one day I’d like to manage <b>[here]</b>. I don’t know when and things in Boca are going really well, I’m really happy and it’s a big challenge, but obviously one day in the future I’d like to manage in MLS</p>

  <p><b>[River Plate vs Boca Juniors]</b> Today we should be talking about how River and Boca are putting Argentina on the highest pedestal possible and instead we are talking about violence instead of what the teams have achieved this season. Unfortunately, we haven’t learned from the same errors we have made before and we have ended up damaging Argentina and South America. What happened two weeks ago happens a lot in Argentina and South America but I think it will have to change because if you cannot play Boca versus River in Argentina it’s very worrying. It’s the time to take measures and start to show an example.</p>

  <p><b>[Barros Schelotto to part ways with Boca after Copa Libertadores defeat to River]</b> I wish to thank the directors, Boca’s employees and the players, because your work comes through the footballers but it has to have the support of the directors and everyone at Boca. I want to avoid any questions you have, today I want to leave peacefully. I gave everything, I’m leaving in peace with the fans, I don’t want to be right, at some point we will see each other again.</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Barros Schelotto tells he believes <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>’s level of play remains at the peak of world football]</b> Sometimes in training he complains, he gets angry. But we know him. He’s very competitive, very demanding. I think he’s helping the players in training to grow and to be more competitive. I’m surprised the level he has. It’s wonderful. It’s the same level as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. He’s 37, he’s older. But I think his level is very high</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United vs <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>. Whoever comes in for Ibrahimovic, Guillermo Barros Schelotto says his side cannot afford to lose as they look to recover their form following a run of four defeats in seven matches]</b> Our challenge will be with other names on the roster to get something in Atlanta. We need the points. Win or at least to tie - we need to learn that when you can’t win, you have to tie. It’s not win or lose. You can’t win, you have to tie, no loss</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto says that <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> needs more protection from VAR following a series of incidents]</b> To be honest I think sometimes, in some plays, I don’t know why some referees do not use the VAR with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> because I could see the penalty for Columbus and I could see twice in the D.C. United game. Everything that happens around <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> is a matter for discussion. Maybe it happens with other teams but those teams or those players don’t attract the same attention. Because he is <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>, situations are exaggerated a lot and also <b>[for the referee]</b> to claim <b>[a foul]</b> they have to be very clear. For <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> it was a penalty. But if we have VAR, we need to use it because <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> went to the floor and felt something and I don’t know why he <b>[the referee]</b> didn’t check it.</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>’s roster for Tuesday night’s Leagues Cup semifinal against Cruz Azul came out Monday. <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto doesn’t seem to be down on the tournament in general]</b> It’s a good idea. I think we can learn from each other<br /><br />Unfortunately, the calendar isn’t working in our favor. We came in playing every three days, this is the fourth game we’re going to play. Honestly, there are players who need rest. Cristian Pavon got here, he played three days later, then he played again three days later. It could hurt him, because he could get injured, but also for the team not having him at 100 percent. You can’t obligate him to play, keeping in mind as well that Sunday we’re playing our derby against LAFC, which is an important game not only with the context of playing the other team in the city but also the points we can get are important for our future<br /><br /><b>[Schelotto didn’t ask for his team to be the only <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side to make it through]</b> Obviously … It’s not that we have an obligation, but, yes, we know we’re the only <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> team left in this competitions and we have to try to get to the final. We’ll try to do that (Tuesday), knowing that we have a near-future with a lot of important games in the league ahead of us. This is game we want to take on with all the seriousness it deserves and try to win</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Barros Schelotto says <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> a ‘dream’ for <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> boss, with <a href="sami-khedira.html">Khedira</a> &amp; <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a> also of interest to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side]</b> It would be a dream, we are talking about one of the best centre-forwards in the world. But honestly, I find it difficult to bring him here immediately. I saw an interview with Gonzalo where he said he wanted to stay at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and in Europe. Maybe it’s too early for <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>, but never say never in football. I personally know the whole family, his father Jorge and brother Federico. We have already brought in <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>’s replacement in <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> Hernandez and we are happy with him. In <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>’s case, it would be a separate matter. It’s a dream for the future, but it won’t be easy<br /><br />Top players like <a href="sami-khedira.html">Khedira</a> and <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a> could be interesting for us, even if it’s impossible to make predictions. Given the health emergency we are experiencing, we can’t know what will happen in the summer and what kind of transfer market it will be<br /><br />Apart from <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>, who in my opinion remains very strong, the ideal partner for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> would be <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> of Inter. <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is an extraordinary No10, with excellent technique</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Barros Schelotto says <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Gonzalo Higuain</a> will be returning to his roots at River Plate and not linking up with <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side the <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> if a move away from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> is to be made]</b> Who wouldn’t want him? I would, but it’s difficult. He could still remain at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, but if he leaves, I think he would choose with his heart. I think he will return to River Plate.<br /><br />Bentancur does not break down and this is a very important gift. In the end, this was his destiny: to play in a great European team. When I said goodbye I told him, ‘This is your moment’. I see him as a right winger and not as a playmaker, he is different from <b>[Miralem]</b> <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a>. He has to improve certain aspects and score more goals. But as far as the psychological aspect is concerned, those who grew up in <a href="boca-juniors.html">the Bombonera</a> do not feel pressure</p>
