  <p><b>[Frederic Kanoute speaks at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Conference for Equality and Inclusion]</b> Quotas are taboo. But in reality we are not treated equally</p>

  <p><b>[Frederic Kanoute believes Paris Saint-Germain’s cadre of stars don’t necessarily make for a great team]</b> PSG have built their team with a lot of stars lately but they need a moment of stability to become a big team. Big players don’t necessarily make a big team. A strong institution is needed, a club with a philosophy, something which is rooted in the system. But I can say that in the pitch, they need to be more realistic. When they played the 1st leg in Madrid, Paris may bite their fingers because they could have get a better result. Real Madrid was the exact opposite - few opportunities but they were very realistic. It’s called experience. PSG players have also experience in the Champions League, but those from Real Madrid have experience as a team<br /><br /><b>[on Unai Emery]</b> Actually I like him. Sometimes I visited my former teammates in Sevilla. When there were training sessions, I used to watch them and he has this intensity, this engagement with the team. He’s 100 per cent in his work! He’s a real passionate and we have to admit it. I love passionate coaches and it’s one of them<br /><br /><b>[Kanoute doesn’t believe PSG is a place where Emery’s tactics can shine through]</b> Tactically, I like it very much. At PSG he plays with extraordinary players so there’s no really space for tactical things, it comes after the rest. It’s true that, as a PSG coach, it doesn’t boost you in terms of tactics because you know that, at the end, you’ve got players who will make the difference. I wish he could be my coach</p>

  <p><b>[Former West Ham striker Frederic Kanoute is disappointed at the club’s Premier League position]</b> It’s sad. It’s a shame because sometimes they show improvement, above all when Bilic was the coach. When he was there, the club started to improve but unfortunately, it seems that they always fall back into old routines. I’ve got a lot of affection for them because it was my first foreign experience, when I decided to leave Lyon, my country. They welcomed me very well, it was an amazing experience, I learned a lot and it was my very first step in my career.<br /><br />Spurs will have some problems with finishing in front of the goal because he is exceptional. But I think that Tottenham is more than that. During the past years their evolution has been impressive. Since Pochettino has arrived, they’ve played another football, it’s a real team with a real tactical system. I think they can deal with Harry Kane absence</p>

  <p><b>[Frederic Kanoute has that Lyon risk losing Ferland Mendy, Tanguy Ndombele, Houssem Aouar and Nabil Fekir]</b> I have seen some games of Lyon, I haven’t seen all the games, but he is a player that has got definitely got something. He is really good, very dynamic and I like him a lot. It’s possible <b>[that he could go]</b>. Generally speaking, I know that Lyon trains its youth very well and that’s why you always have fantastic players coming up. Whether it is him or other players they have right now, it’s the good business of Lyon that makes it happen. They focus on youth development and that works for them<br /><br />Ndombele in the last few games I have seen, I was very impressed. His quality, it is amazing to see a player with his energy, with such strength. He has pretty much everything and is still young as well. I’m sure that he already has a lot of clubs interested in buying him. We will see what happens<br /><br /><b>[On Nabil Fekir]</b> He got injured a couple of years back and it was very difficult for him to come back to his level and now he is there. I think that next summer will be difficult for him, the club is going to receive lots of offers for sure. He’s the leader of that team, lots of quality. He got injured not that long ago so he couldn’t leave the club, it wasn’t the time for him, but now he is very much ready to leave if the club agrees to a good deal for them<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what Lyon need to do in order to claim a notable scalp]</b> What do you need to do well against Barcelona? It’s a very difficult question. I don’t have the answer otherwise I think a lot of clubs would hire me as their coach and pay me millions! It’s a difficult one. They are a club that has a real history and philosophy and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi! All of that together makes it very difficult. I wish them all the best. This competition allows anything to happen. If they were playing in the same league, Lyon wouldn’t get a chance to win the league but in this competition, one game at home, anything can happen. We have seen in the past that anything is possible, even though it is going to be very difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla are capable of cementing a standing as Europa League specialists]</b> They are one of the favourites. But this season is going to be difficult with the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea, and a lot of others. But, they are still well into the competition. I saw the first game against Lazio and they pretty much cruised against them so hopefully they can win the second leg and then after that anything is possible. I really believe they can make it but this year is going to be very tough.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether Andre Silva is worth keeping on or would represent a risk at €40 million]</b> The end of the season will tell us a lot about whether or not they should sign him. Obviously, he is a very good player. Especially at the beginning of the season, he was really good. He is a player that can be really interesting for Sevilla. There are a few months to go and anything that happens from now on will help Sevilla and the player make the right decision. It will be interesting to see<br /><br /><b>[Andre Silva’s partnership with Wissam Ben Yedder]</b> It’s very good. I enjoy watching them. Lots of people have compared the partnership I had with Luis Fabiano and this one. Ben Yedder has been really good in all of the years that he has been with Sevilla and is doing great. I think that offensively he is the best asset that Sevilla have. The two together can make a really good partnership<br /><br /><b>[Asked for the secrets behind an Jesus Navas’s longevity]</b> Physically, he is a beast. I remember when we were doing pre-season training and when it was hard for everybody to do the endurance tests, he was not even breathing hard or sweating while everyone else was lying on the floor! Naturally, he is really strong physically, has good endurance and also has a good lifestyle, a stable life, and that helps him to carry on for a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Hernandez may look for a move away from West Ham]</b> He’s a striker that I like. He’s proven his quality over the years with big clubs. I guess the coach sees it otherwise. He knows the players better than me. It might be surprising because of his name and the quality of striker that he is but the coach knows his team better than anyone. The most important thing is that the team works and hopefully that is what will happen.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether Hernandez may need a change of scenery]</b> He might want to move. He might have some discussions with the club to see what they want to do with him and what he wants to do. I feel that he is going to have options if he is going to move in the summer<br /><br /><b>[On Marko Arnautovic]</b> It was crucial for them to keep this level of player and bring in a few new ones that can bring that extra quality which is needed for a club like West Ham. It was very important for them to keep him and hopefully they can be a little bit higher in the table in the second part of the season<br /><br /><b>[On Samir Nasri]</b> He’s a fantastic player. He’s been at top clubs and has great quality. Hopefully now he can show the Hammers all of his talent and find stability at this club to give a new start to his career as well</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham need trophies to keep Kane &amp; Pochettino from Real Madrid &amp; Man Utd]</b> He’s obviously one of the best strikers in Europe right now. He might want to go and have a new experience to take his career to another level. At the same time, if he can win something fairly soon with Tottenham then I think they have the chance to keep him. But it’s going to be difficult. They have done so in the last couple of years, keeping hold of their players, we know they haven’t transferred new players and they haven’t bought any players at all this season. They keep maintaining a very high standard so that’s good. In modern football that is very rare.<br /><br />I know this is a big debate in England and I also think that they need some silverware, they need something to make sure they go past that level where they are just good but don’t win anything. I think they really need to make it happen, win something and they will be able to write the next part of their history by keeping Pochettino and carrying on developing the club. It might be difficult to keep the coach in the coming years, especially if they don’t win anything<br /><br />I think a lot of people are writing Spurs off because unfortunately in the last few years they couldn’t maintain the level that they have started the league with. It’s been a bit difficult for them to maintain that level and be very competitive at the end of the league to make it. Nonetheless, I think they still have a chance but it’s going to be very, very tough against Liverpool and Manchester City - who are just kind of cruising a little bit more than any other team in England</p>

  <p><b>[Frederic Kanoute reached for the stars during his glittering period in La Liga]</b> I’m scared of heights. So, going into space, no way.<br /><br /><b>[And neither did he fancy swimming with sharks]</b> I love to do this kind of stuff and just be at peace with the environment</p>
