  <p><b>[Toni Duggan discusses her favourite <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Blaugrana</a> star]</b> I like <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> and the style that he plays. I’m from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> myself and grew up a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan. It’s like he’s playing on the street with his mates sometimes and I just like that style, and that’s the way I am. Hopefully I can bring what he has brought to the men’s team to the women’s</p>

I said they were one of my teams to watch but hopefully they aren’t here for too much longer! It will be a great game. They have some top players and a lot of them play in the WSL.</p>

  <p><b>[Toni Duggan has left <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> following two successful seasons with the club]</b> It was a dream come true to wear the famous colours of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a>. To represent one of the biggest and most special clubs in the world has been a huge honour - but I feel the time is right for me to pursue a new challenge. Together with my teammates and, of course, the wonderful supporters, I was able to win two trophies and enjoy many other memorable moments. A great many people have helped me over the last two years and I want to thank them all - you will always be in my heart. Forca <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>!.<br /><br /><b>[After two years abroad, her next club will be revealed in due course, with a decision to stay out of England unlikely to surprise many given how fondly she has spoken of her experiences in Spain]</b> It’s been an unbelievable experience. I’ve loved every minute of it and I’d recommend it to youth coming through because, like I said, it takes you out of your comfort zone: you learn a new language, a new style of play</p>

  <p><b>[Toni Duggan has joined Spanish champions <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> on a free transfer after her contract with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> expired]</b> I am very happy to play at Atlético de Madrid. It is a club that is very supportive of the women’s team and the staff it has is very good. I am a creative player who can bring goals and assists. I am a winner and I come to the club to help you in everything I can in all competitions. Last season’s game at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a> made me realise how big this club is</p>

  <p><b>[Toni Duggan speaks after completing her move to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> When I went to look around the club, they’ve built their own training facility for the women, that’s the first time I’ve seen that for the women’s game. They’re the kind of things that drew me in. Playing at the Wanda in front of that many people and the support they had. You could also see straight away the support the men’s team gives the women’s team. It felt right</p>

  <p><b>[England Women’s international Toni Duggan said she was never close to signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after leaving <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> last summer and that the rumours on Twitter were new for women’s football]</b> The girls want to make history, reach the next round for the first time. I can’t wait. A big reason for signing for Atletico was the Champions League. There were other offers, good offers, but they weren’t in it. That <b>[the United rumours]</b> literally just stemmed from Twitter. <b>[United players and England colleagues]</b> Abbie McManus and <a href="mary-earps.html">Mary Earps</a>, good friends, signed and it just grows and grows, but I was never close to signing.<br /><br />It was. People assumed because they’d seen it on Twitter. I’ve never really been in that position before: I don’t think women’s football itself has. Honestly it’s like: God bless the men’s players because they get it every week<br /><br />It’s about being happy. I was happy but the football was a little bit frustrating. They have an identity, a philosophy, which I enjoy but I felt it didn’t get the best out of me as a No 9. I haven’t yet scored as many as I did there to start with, but I’m more involved in the game, more comfortable, more happy with my performances. It’s City but it’s tough whoever you face. We lost in Kazakhstan last year. That’s the Champions League, it’s amazing. That’s why I came. I absolutely love the competition. I want to be a part of it and I want to be part of it to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Toni Duggan and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> Women FC had reached their first Champions League final, yet after five minutes in Budapest they were a goal down to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. After 15, it was two. After 30, it was four]</b> It hurt. it hurt a lot. I wanted the ground to suck me in; you just want the game to end. It was so … it was just like … You don’t want that for women’s football, you don’t want that for yourself, to be part of that. I’m a positive person. I was saying: ‘we’re going to win it, we’re going to win it’. I believed in the team, but when that happens against <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> you’ve got a mountain to climb. On the pitch, I still had belief but it’s more anger and frustration and embarrassment. I watched Istanbul and that was a mountain too but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have history, they’ve been in finals, won trophies. With <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it was new and <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> have won and won and won and won and it was so easy. It was really difficult to take<br /><br /><b>[Not everyone shared her tears]</b> A lot of the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> girls are young, 22, 23, and they’re getting selfies with their medal and stuff. I’m not criticising: it’s amazing to reach a Champions League final at 22, make history for your hometown club, but I was in a different mind-set. I’d been to semi-finals with City. I was always that close. I’d been defeated by <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> so much. And I felt this was the day. I just felt it. And it wasn’t. They were trying to console me: ‘don’t worry, we’ve done well’, but I was in a different place<br /><br /><b>[Soon, she really was move to a different city with a different club, but the same aim: Atlético Madrid Women FC]</b> The girls want to create history, reach the next round for the first time. I can’t wait. A big part of signing for Atlético was the Champions League. There were other clubs interested, good offers, but they weren’t in it<br /><br /><b>[One who give offer was <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, they said]</b> That literally just stemmed from Twitter <b>[laughs]</b>. Abbie McManus and <a href="mary-earps.html">Mary Earps</a>, good friends, signed and it just grows and grows and grows and grows, but I was never close to signing. It was <b>[weird]</b>. People assumed because they’d seen it on Twitter. I’ve never really been in that position before: I don’t think women’s football itself has. When I was at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, there was this thing about me going out with Sergio Agüero and I was like: ‘This is news to me’. Honestly, it’s like: God bless the men’s players because they get it every week. Oh my God. I just laughed it off<br /><br />It’s the easy option to go home: my family’s there, boyfriend, friends. That’s the thing people don’t realise. The men can bring the family over. It’s easier financially. I’d love that opportunity; I’d probably be in Spain my whole career. But <b>[the salary]</b> doesn’t allow it. There’ll be a time I go home: my mum wants me to already. But it’s a nice lifestyle, too. I was speaking to <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> and he said the same. I played in England, at the top level, for years and won everything. I’m glad I took this opportunity. Spain’s an amazing place to play<br /><br /><b>[But why not stay at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?]</b> I was happy but the football was a little bit frustrating. They have an identity, a philosophy, which I enjoy but I felt it didn’t get the best out of me as a No 9. I looked at Atlético, where I would fit, spoke to the manager and president. I played them last year and knew their style, the supporters. And I turn up and it feels like a family already<br /><br /><b>[Another shot at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, the club that sometimes feels invincible?]</b> Yeah, they do. The financial support has helped them bring in top players, unbelievable. Other clubs don’t have that luxury. Consistently winning breeds success, too. Teams fear them. I used to feel that a bit at City: I wouldn’t say it was easy but come 70 minutes their mind-set would be ‘we’re against City, we’ll never win’. As soon as someone breaks <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> down - we came close in preseason - and people see they’re not invincible, it might change<br /><br />I speak to the four English girls there and they tell me: all they care about is the Champions League. At <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, our aim wasn’t to win the Champions League. There was a sense everyone was happy to be there, a fantastic achievement. I was like ‘this is the day’. It didn’t happen, but it’s inspired me to try again<br /><br /><b>[The Atletico manager, Jose Luis Sanchez Vera, left for personal reasons 10 days before the first City game, they were hammered by her former club, and they’ve suffered injuries]</b> The spirit to deal with all this, I can’t tell you say how strong it is - that’s got to be a reason they won the league the last two seasons. We’re playing well now, winning, I’m really enjoying it<br /><br /><b>[Facing her former club was a nice draw]</b> I honestly don’t care; I just want to get through <b>[Laugh]</b>. I care that my family could come <b>[to the first leg]</b> easily. I was like: ‘Yes! City!’ They’re the most supportive family and friends I could wish for. In <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, every game, someone came<br /><br />Here too. I feel like a travel agent, always sorting flights, but I couldn’t do this without them. The fans gave me a good reception there too, as always: they’re amazing. It’s nice they appreciate you, there’s respect, but if a couple stick the finger up or said I was crap I wouldn’t blink. It’s football. It’s City but it’s tough whoever you face. We lost in Kazakhstan last year. That’s the Champions League, it’s amazing. That’s why I came. I absolutely love the competition. I want to be a part of it and I want to be part of it to the end</p>
