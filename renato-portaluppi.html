  <p><b>[Gremio players took to the pitch wearing facemasks in protest at being made to play as the virus spreads]</b> The whole world has stopped - shouldn’t Brazilian football stop as well? That’s our message and I hope they listen. We hope that good sense will prevail</p>

  <p><b>[Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi says Arthur will be in a strong position regardless of whether he sticks around at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or heads for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I think <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are two great clubs on the world stage, representing the very top in their nations and are always in the running for the biggest trophies. They are on the same level, have the same greatness and pedigree. If I could count on Arthur, I’d never want to sell him. Unfortunately, Gremio were forced to sell because the money offered could not be turned down<br /><br />Arthur is a tactical player. Very intelligent. One of his greatest qualities is that he can play well in any part of the field where he is put by his coach, then when he has ball you can always expect a great game from him. He has great game vision, I feel like saying he is one of the best in his role.</p>
