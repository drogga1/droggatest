  <p><b>[on <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is exemplary on the pitch. When I saw him play, I said to myself that he is not just one top player but he is simply one of the greatest players in the history of football. I can say that <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is a humble person. He has never missed a training session, he has never asked for preferential treatment even if he is 37.<br /><br />He is a person that adores football and who is always there. Perhaps he is not a leader in the changing room. <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is not the one that starts to shout in order to motivate the troops but he is appreciated by his team-mates because he is an intelligent person, who is always ready to joke, and that is something positive</p>

I’m alone in my sporting choices<br /><br /><a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s training centre is of high quality with talented young players.

  <p><b>[Rayan Cherki already has <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>’s backing but <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> sensation must keep his feet on the ground]</b> I don’t want to downplay what he did on his stats because we’re going to praise him to the skies. He must listen and work again because he’s still not arrived. He’s off the mark but I must say that he was clever in his choices and made a strong defensive effort. If he continues like this, he will continue to progress<br /><br /><b>[If the player’s attitude was not exemplary, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s board have been reassured by the confirmation that he has loved ones who will not let him get carried away with his new-found fame]</b> I think Rayan is surrounded by very good people. He is polite and attentive. You’re not like that without a quality entourage. We all keep telling him that he will have the career he deserves if he continues to work. The danger is to make him believe that he is already one of the best players on the planet<br /><br /><b>[Thankfully, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s staff are well used to successfully managing such hype]</b> <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> had this with <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, who he started at 17 years old.

  <p><b>[Rudi Garcia says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is still among the best players on the planet]</b> I don’t know him but he’s a great professional. He works more than the others, both before and after sessions. It is interesting for the sport to have such players. He is among the best on the planet and it’s nice to face him. There is no anti-Ronaldo plan - we have to deal with all of their champions. If we need an anti-Ronaldo plan, we need an anti-Dybala plan, an anti-Higuain plan. There are too many good players on this team to solve problems individually. We’re going to have to solve them collectively</p>

A left-hander, an attacker, a dribbler, we need it. We worked with Bertrand to make him less readable.<br /><br />He can overflow his right foot, play with others, in one touch. He can do very, very good things. He will finish the season better than he started. I highly value him, he needs to be given confidence</p>
