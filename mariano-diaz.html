<blockquote>
  <p>[Mariano Diaz claims to be embracing the pressure of inheriting Real Madrid’s No.7 jersey from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>] For me it’s a great pride. It’s a shirt that great players have worn. I don’t feel that [pressure]. It gives me strength to keep fighting like they’ve all done before, like Juanito and Cristiano and everyone else.<br /><br />[Mariano could face even more competition next season – with the Blancos said to be keen on Eintracht Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic] Everyone who comes in, in any position, will be welcomed. That’ll be for the good of the squad and it’ll make us all stronger<br /><br />[Mariano is adamant that he will not be pushing for another move when the transfer window reopens] No, not anymore. This is my team. My plan is to continue here, with my team. I want to show what I came here to do. This is going to be my year. I fought hard to get to Real Madrid. I’ve worked really hard and I’ve always wanted this. Now I’m here so I’ll do my best to play in the best team in the world<br /><br />[Quizzed on what happened and what can be done about it] It’s been a difficult season for everyone and it’s always the way. The press are always there and we have to accept that. It’s been tough because we haven’t achieved our goals, but now we have to think about next year, which is the important one. We have to try to win as much as possible. Nobody has been up to the task, but what’s better than a new year to show that we can do better?</p>

While Real Madrid are continuing to offload players this week, one departure that is not expected is that of striker Mariano Diaz despite interest from Monaco</p>
