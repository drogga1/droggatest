  <p><b>[He quit international duty with the Dominican Republic after just one friendly appearance, during which he scored against Haiti, in order to chase instead the possibility of playing for Spain]</b> There’s nothing concrete yet, though. The Dominican team contacts me often, but I’ve chosen Spain and I want to be called.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar would fit in really well at Real Madrid]</b> I’ve already said that he’s a brilliant player, and he’d fit in really well there.<br /><br /><b>[On Kylian Mbappe]</b> Another excellent player, and he’s demonstrating that. He’s doing magnificent things in his first year at PSG. He’s still very young and he’s got a lot of ambition<br /><br />Cristiano is Cristiano. Right now people are talking about him a lot, about how he’s not at his best, but if he scores two goals against PSG he’ll be Cristiano again. You can’t say much more about that footballer<br /><br /><b>[On Karim Benzema]</b> I think he’s doing the same things as always, but what is happening is that the team is going through a bad patch. He’s playing and linking up well, I always say that. Benzema is a magnificent striker<br /><br /><b>[If Mariano continues to impress in France, then he could become another target for Real at some stage]</b> No, there isn’t a clause. I know that Madrid have a percentage of the rights, but I’m absolutely Lyon’s player</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon striker Mariano Diaz has admitted that he would one day love to return to Real Madrid]</b> I have a five-year contract with Lyon but going back to Madrid would be incredible, even if I decided it was best to leave the club in the summer<br /><br /><b>[Zinedine Zidane’s men to regain their European crown ahead of Manchester City]</b> I prefer Madrid. City, both in the Premier League and Champions League, have played at a good level but it will have to be seen how they react when faced with a big club<br /><br />I went to France to be a big player and for me it would be the realisation of a great dream to be in the Spain squad. Of course I hope for it</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has confirmed that Mariano Diaz has expressed a wish to leave the club]</b> Mariano has told us that he wants to leave. Sevilla are interested and we’ve got an agreement with them. Real Madrid could match their offer and contact us. Nothing is done</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Mariano Diaz? The €30m striker Real Madrid have stolen away from Sevilla]</b> I have a five-year contract with Lyon but going back to Madrid would be incredible, even if I decided it was best to leave the club in the summer. It was the correct decision by Madrid to let me go: for me, for them, for Lyon. But it is true that it would be a dream for me to return in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Mariano Diaz claims to be embracing the pressure of inheriting Real Madrid’s No.7 jersey from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> For me it’s a great pride. It’s a shirt that great players have worn. I don’t feel that <b>[pressure]</b>. It gives me strength to keep fighting like they’ve all done before, like Juanito and Cristiano and everyone else.<br /><br /><b>[Mariano could face even more competition next season - with <a href="real-madrid.html">the Blancos</a> said to be keen on <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> striker <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a>]</b> Everyone who comes in, in any position, will be welcomed. That’ll be for the good of the squad and it’ll make us all stronger<br /><br /><b>[Mariano is adamant that he will not be pushing for another move when the transfer window reopens]</b> No, not anymore. This is my team. My plan is to continue here, with my team. I want to show what I came here to do. This is going to be my year. I fought hard to get to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I’ve worked really hard and I’ve always wanted this. Now I’m here so I’ll do my best to play in the best team in the world<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what happened and what can be done about it]</b> It’s been a difficult season for everyone and it’s always the way. The press are always there and we have to accept that. It’s been tough because we haven’t achieved our goals, but now we have to think about next year, which is the important one. We have to try to win as much as possible. Nobody has been up to the task, but what’s better than a new year to show that we can do better?</p>
