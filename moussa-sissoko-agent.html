  <p><b>[<a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a>’s agent has denied reports that his client flew to Senegal after Barcelona’s 1-0 loss to Athletic Bilbao on Friday]</b> It’s not true, he didn’t travel to Senegal. He was in Rennes in his mother’s house. I assure you 100%<br /><br /><b>[The player’s agent also denied that his client hid the full extent of his injury from the team’s medical staff after the match against Athletic Bilbao]</b> After the game, he thought they were cramps</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a>’s agent has insisted that his client will stay at Barcelona despite receiving offers from several big European clubs]</b> I wanted to clarify firmly and definitively the situation of <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a>. He has not planned on leaving FC Barcelona even for a moment. This is the course of action set for several months now and no element is or will be likely to make us deviate from it. Ousmane feels perfectly well within the club and he remains determined to impose himself in the long term. Despite the offers of several big European clubs, Ousmane is convinced he wants to be part of the biggest of them and that everything is set for him to flourish. Unfortunately, his injury has temporarily stopped him during his drive to have a great and beautiful season. But this will not affect his success and his will to return as soon as possible. He is Barcelona and he will stay 1000 per cent with the will to honour the colours of the club!</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko says <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> does not care if Neymar joins Barcelona]</b> He doesn’t feel at all threatened. When you play at Barca, you expect to be in competition there. Neymar or another, he does not care about that, he only cares about what he has to do<br /><br />We received shows of interest from big clubs. But we were clear on the fact that he did not want to leave. I told them from the start that he wants to succeed in Barcelona. The door is closed, and Paris or any other club are aware of our intentions. Will he be at Barca this season? In our plans, he wants to stay and all his work is towards that. We are working on that</p>

There is no chance he will leave. He wants to and will succeed at Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[Sissoko doubled down on his statements where he asserted that sporting success took precedent over salary for his client]</b> I repeat for the 20th time, Ousmane will stay and succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. The deal would have been better financially in Paris for Ousmane and for me, his agent, but money is not the most important thing, it is success in his career. We are not scared of adversity, Ousmane has battled his entire life to get where he is today and he will keep fighting to achieve his ambitions. A lot of people say to players that they only think about money and here is the proof that they don’t, the most important thing is not the financial aspect but rather his wellbeing and sporting success<br /><br /><b>[Sissoko also dismissed reports that rumours of misbehaviour and the forward’s shaky injury history caused <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> to hesitate over his signing]</b> <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> are not the problem, the only thing that matters is that Ousmane does not want to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he feels good there and he knows what he has to do to triumph in this great club. The future will be great for him at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, he will establish himself to succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, I invite you all to record that statement and we will talk about it soon</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar deal hinges on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> persuading Dembele to join PSG]</b> I repeat for the 20th time, Ousmane will stay and succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. The deal would have been better financially in Paris for Ousmane and for me, his agent, but money is not the most important thing, it is success in his career. I’m really looking forward to that day coming and we can give everything a rest and we all know the state of everything because this has been going on a long time. On the subject of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, I have nothing to say. He’s a player at another team. We respect our rivals and we’ll see what happens. Dembele? At the moment, he is injured. We’ll have to wait and see. I’m not going to comment on anything on Dembele\</p>

He brought a new freshness. We aren’t going to spit on what <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> did, he brought the club to a new level, but now our future is <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>. We have objectives, fourth place is still doable. We’re going to do everything. At one point, we had a lot of games, injuries, important players missing. The team was put in difficulty, we had bad results, we’re aware of that. If we have the chance to start the league again, everyone will be fit. We’ll be at full strength.</p>

  <p><b>[Doubts cast on Dembele departure from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as agent addresses transfer talk]</b> I don’t expect Dembele to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> this summer. <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> signed for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> almost three years ago and he has already had enough time to establish himself in the club and prove his value. It’s possible that he will never show his quality at the club. He is still a player with huge potential, but I think this summer could be the right opportunity for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to sell or even exchange him for a player they’re chasing already. He’s been unlucky with injuries, but he might also have tried to give more at some moments. Things haven’t gone according to expectations and he might be able to revive his career at another club where he will feel more confident to play at his best. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> seem to be trying to sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>, so Dembele will probably struggle to get in the first team next season. Additionally, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would need to reduce its squad and earn some money if they really want to succeed in bringing in their current targets. To sign new players, others must leave</p>
