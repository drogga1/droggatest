<blockquote>
  <p><a href="jose-aldo.html">Jose Aldo</a> was undefeated for a decade and wore the UFC featherweight belt for five indestructible years. So when the Brazilian was knocked out in 13 seconds by <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> two Decembers ago, the blink-of-an-eye stunner easily could have been mistaken for a mirage. Many fans had never known a time in MMA when the 145-pound division was the domain of anyone other than the menacing Brazilian<br /><br />Aldo the opportunity to regain the legitimate top spot of the mountain. But his showdown with the rising Max Holloway back in June didnâ€™t go his way. Even though Aldo won the first two rounds, the Hawaiian knocked him down in the third and finished him<br /><br />On Saturday night in Detroit, Aldo had a precious shot at redemption. Holloway had been scheduled to defend against Frankie Edgar, but the former lightweight champ suffered an eye injury and had to pull out of the fight. So the UFC called on its storied ex-champ<br /><br />Unlike the first fight, which didnâ€™t go so well for him at the start, the 25-year-old Hawaiian was poised and in control from the moment referee Herb Dean waved the two men together at the start<br /><br />While being interviewed at the center of the octagon, he was asked whether two finishes of Aldo (26-4), the man considered the greatest featherweight in the sport’s history, made him now the greatest ever. Holloway was shaking his head before the question was finished</p>
