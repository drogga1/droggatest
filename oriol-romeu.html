  <p>[Oriol Romeu claims he would snub a return to Barcelona in favour of regular football at Premier League relegation-threatened Southampton] Nothing reached me. Yes, I heard some comment that they needed players there and various names were considered, but they never contacted me or my agent. They probably didn’t see me as an option.<br /><br />To go to a big club to be in the second tier [of players], I don’t know if I would accept it. I don’t enjoy [it], what I want is to play. I don’t think that at Barca I could have been a starting player, it’s like that and you have to be aware of the options that one has</p>

  <p>[The story of Mauro Icardi’s time at Barcelona - and why he left La Masia for Italy] He was always covered by his family. He only had a small connection with us. We’ve met a few times since then. And we always talk about Barcelona. He didn’t have the same multi-faceted profile like most of the other strikers that we had in La Masia, but he knew how to hold the ball and he was a great goalscorer. How well he played in terms of his direct game was a given, and he could fight well with central defenders</p>
