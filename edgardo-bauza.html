  <p><b>[Argentina head coach Edgardo Bauza speaks about the team’s relationship with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> on the pitch]</b> Working with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has to do with the team. If you look at both the Copa America Centenario semi-final and final, you can see the difference: In one match he had a lot of options <b>[to pass the ball and look for options on offence]</b>, in the other he didn’t. The team has to do that for him, they have to be sure that when they pass the ball to him, he must have choices to pass it back, because if there is one thing <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has shown us, it is that he makes very good choices. We need to not be Messi-dependent. Yes, he is our MVP, but the rest of the team has to give us more depth as well</p>

  <p><b>[Edgardo Bauza speaks about the pressures of life as a national team coach]</b> I don’t sleep, neither before or after the matches. Every day I sleep less and less, but that’s usual, I do a lot of thinking. Before and after the matches I analyse everything, but that’s normal. Unfortunately, I’m not reading as much as I’d like to. I’ve been sent some books on football, that, even though I’m already familiar with them, I give them a chance to see if I find something new. I’ve been sent books of <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Arrigo Sacchi</a>, <a href="jorge-valdano.html">Valdano</a>, <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>. I read a couple of pages and then change the book. If I can take away some ideas from them, it works</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina manager Edgardo Bauza considers Lionel Messi to be happy at Barcelona]</b> I can see just how happy he is at Barcelona with his family around him. Of course when Leo is happy that helps him give his best performance, morale is crucial for form. A footballer is happy when he is playing and winning, otherwise he is rarely happy.<br /><br />At Barcelona, Manchester City or wherever, that’s his decision to take. I just want him to play and that’s all. He’s the type of player who always wants to be on the pitch, never wants a rest<br /><br />Some say the fact he’s won nothing with Argentina means he’s not the best in the world, not the most dangerous, not worth as much as some others. But we are going to try and win this next World Cup, which will make him one of the greatest of all time</p>

  <p><b>[Edgardo Bauza is not concerned about the recent history between his side and Chile ahead of Thursday’s crucial clash between the two South American rivals in 2018 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup Russia qualifying]</b> I wouldn’t say that it’s a final, but it is a decisive match. I need to take the team away from the last two finals they played in. They didn’t lose them. They just lost on penalties. There’s always been rivalry with Chile, but we need to boil it down to this one game, which is an important one against a direct rival. The only thing that should be in our minds is that if we beat them, we overtake them</p>

  <p><b>[Edgardo Bauza has played down any suggestion that Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano had a say in Argentina selection calls]</b> Neither Mascherano nor Messi nor anyone else has ever influenced my call-ups or line-ups. Never. In the eight months I guided the Seleccion, no player ever created problems, I’m grateful to each of them. I met Icardi and he knew that I could call him at any time. No-one ever told me anything about him or others.<br /><br />Diego has the right to say whatever he wants, given the position he occupies in Argentinian football. One day we’ll meet, we’ll have a chat and talk about it. There was never any player who had a problem with Icardi</p>

  <p><b>[United Arab Emirates have appointed Argentinian Edgardo Bauza as the new coach of their national side as they pursue a place at their first FIFA World Cup in almost 30 years]</b> The coaching of the UAE National Team is a new challenge and I hope to succeed in this mission.</p>

  <p><b>[New UAE coach Edgardo Bauza focused on long-term plan]</b> First of all, it is a personal challenge. We are all on the same page, the UAE FA President and me. We are not only thinking about the three games <b>[in World Cup qualifying]</b> but also long term. It is a long term project and that is what I have in mind as well. That’s my main goal. I want to start work as soon as possible and try and improve the team for the initial term of two years. But we are looking beyond as everyone is on the same page and have the same aim.<br /><br />It is difficult but mathematically, it is still possible. For sure, we will try and give it our best. We will try to win all our remaining three games. Of course, it is difficult because it just doesn’t depend on my team. It depends on other results. We can win the three of them but then you have to look at other results<br /><br />I had done some research about the team before coming here but I now have some more knowledge about the team after watching three games from the qualifying campaign. From this, I will start working and try and improve the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand vs UAE: Edgardo Bauza targets three points despite limited preparations]</b> I am confident that my start will be a good match for the UAE against Thailand, given the good players’ situation and their appearance at a good level and with a positive response during the training and preparations that preceded the game.<br /><br />I would have preferred to spend at least a month preparing for the team, not just 12 days. Overall, we tried to use that short period well and prepare the players technically and physically for the first task. We hope that we will succeed in that task and that we can make the fans happy<br /><br />We had good preparation in the UAE, Malaysia and Thailand. We benefited greatly from the experience of the friendly against Laos and we have been able to formulate a plan to garner three points against Thailand</p>

  <p><b>[UAE national team coach Edgardo Bauza was disappointed with his team’s 1-1 draw to Thailand]</b> Today’s match was not what I wanted. I am sad for this result. I am not happy at all. I know the situation in the group is bad but we will work hard for the next matches against Saudi and Iraq. For the future, I will work with my team to ensure they are ready for the next matches. I have a plan and vision and will make sure we are prepared.</p>
