  <p><b>[Pescara midfielder Sulley Muntari walked off the field in protest at alleged racist chants during his side’s 1-0 defeat to Cagliari]</b> Muntari asked the referee to intervene, but he did not do it. We talk so much about racism, but then we just move on. This happened to Muntari who has played in Italy for several years - we want to change the mentality. He left the field because of the chants, but we should not have to take justice into our own hands.</p>

  <p><b>[Sulley Muntari accuses referee who sent him off for challenging racist abuse of lacking ‘balls’]</b> The referee didn’t stop play because he didn’t have the balls. If you are a man, you must have the balls to stop play. It’d just be for a second, but in that second, you can make a big difference. We are all created by God, the only difference is in the colour of our skin.<br /><br />Cagliari, the players and club weren’t at fault, so I cannot condemn them. I do not judge anyone. God judges everyone. I am human, just like them, and we all make mistakes, but you can’t kid around with things like this. I didn’t expect to be suspended and that was ugly … You tell me something, I ask ‘why?’ and I get banned? That’s not right<br /><br />What happened is, in my view, not normal. We’re in 2017, aren’t we? Why do we walk out at the start of a game with children as mascots? To teach them good manners, then when they grow up, they become great men. We have to set the example, those of us on the pitch, the referee who blows the whistle, the linesman - everyone.<br /><br />The kid said something and I went over to him with that tone, you know when speaking to children, they are innocent … I am sure he didn’t even know what he had said. I got closer and said to him: ‘You shouldn’t do things like that, it’s not right’. He ran off and I tried to get him to come back. I took off my own shirt and handed it to him to reassure him, because he was only little, so pure. Then I left. I didn’t talk to his father, because what was I meant to tell him? The parents are those who should teach their kids well and then they grow up to become good men, for themselves, for their parents, for all of Italy and all the world. Football is about peace, not war</p>

  <p><b>[Asked how often he heard racist abuse]</b> Every game. I was sitting down <b>[Sunday]</b> and it was happening. There was a player playing and it was happening in the stands, so how are we going to tackle this? This isn’t the first time it has happened. We talk about it and after maybe one week, two weeks it’s gone. Then, maybe after a month or two later, it happens somewhere and you get calls to talk about it and then it’s shut again.</p>
