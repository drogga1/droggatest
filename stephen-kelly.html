<blockquote>
  <p>[Stephen Kelly says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> need a trophy in order to keep <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at the helm] From a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> point of view, his longevity at the club will mean him needing to win something at the club to stay there. Because his stock is getting higher and higher and it’s going to be harder and harder for them to keep hold of him because people will come knocking on his door. The opportunities are gone now for like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but they will come back around and if he is still rising up that ladder, there will be teams interested.<br /><br />So he has been extremely loyal and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been loyal to him, but now they need to try and give him funding, allow him to improve the squad and create competition. Because they have a great squad, but it is creating the competition to get players to raise their game more which I think is important. But for him, they need a trophy, they want a trophy. They came so close last season and to get to the Champions League final was a huge step for them, because they had always been nearly there.</p>
