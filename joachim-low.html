Jens has not played so much recently. There is no reason to determine the hierarchy at the start of training camp. But if everything goes on as usual, if Jens is in form in the two games before the tournament and he is in top condition, then you can assume that he will be our No. 1. There is a competition for the place between the posts but Jens does have some advantage over the others. But we’ll be looking at the training impressions over the entire two weeks</p>

He has also played a lot of games lately. He went very fast and covered a lot of ground. Serge showed up almost everywhere, was always very dangerous and made the Argentine defence insecure in the first half.

  <p><b>[Joachim Low does not believe Germany can be considered the favourites to win Euro 2020]</b> I think, we can be satisfied with the year. When it comes to the development as a whole, there are surely other nations who are ahead of us. England, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium - those teams had been forced into a big transformation before, because during the last big tournaments, like England for example, they exited early a few times<br /><br />Therefore, those teams have been playing together for three, four years now. The same goes for Netherlands, who have had a well-adjusted team for three, four years. That’s not the case for us at the moment, which is why I don’t see us as the favourites for this tournament. But one thing is for sure, that we’ll try everything, prepare well and that we want to reach the maximum during the tournament<br /><br />No idea. I don’t know what it’ll be next year. Yesterday some of the injured players were here with us. But then there are more players like <a href="niklas-sule.html">Sule</a> and Sane who are doing rehab, where we don’t know how they’re going to be. It’s also important for me, in what shape players are in January, February or March. And then during the months to follow, who’s able to play, who’s in a good rhythm. There are certainly a couple of decisions which I can’t answer today<br /><br /><b>[He believes the matches the team play during the international break in March next year will show where the team is at]</b> It’s no surprise that we want to win the game. Of course, the chance to finish first in the group is a bit of extra motivation. We’ve got some good players who have had some minutes. In terms of a grade, I’d put the year between a B and a C, because it’s nothing special that we’ve qualified. Several of the younger players have improved already. We’ve made some progress. The international games in March will be important again as we play against big nations. We’ll have to wait and see how we perform at the Euros, but I have a good feeling about it</p>

  <p><b>[Low on Serge Gnabry]</b> I’ve always had the highest possible opinion of <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a>. Right from the start it was obvious to me he would be a fantastically important player. He was always one to pass the ball to, he doesn’t play up front all the time, he lets himself fall back a bit and you can find him anywhere on the pitch and he’s able to play in many different positions. These are prime qualities in any players and also his finishing is technically fantastic. When he was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> he was plagued by injury and all these injuries set him back. But even at the time, around the 2014 World Cup he had always been in my thoughts.

  <p><b>[Low happy to see Germany in ‘group of death’ after Euro 2020 draw]</b> At first I feel joy because these are highlight games against France and Portugal. We play against the reigning world champions and European champions. I think the players are also looking forward to these games. Of course it’s a group of death. Everyone in this group has to go to the limit if they want to get ahead. But I think that these games will be football festivals. Then we also play in Germany. I’m looking forward to it</p>

  <p><b>[Germany manager Joachim Low has questioned the wisdom of ​Alexander Nubel’s impending move to Bayern Munich]</b> Basically, I am a supporter of young players getting as much playing time as possible. That way they can develop better. If a player is 20 or 21 and sits on the bench for two or three years, I don’t know if that’s useful</p>

  <p><b>[Germany’s Low happy with <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> and <a href="niklas-sule.html">Niklas Sule</a>’s recovery as injured pair battle to make Euros]</b> Regarding the Euros, I hope my national players will stay in form and clear of injuries. <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> and Niklas Süle will get all the time they need following their severe knee injuries and we are happy, they’re progressing well<br /><br /><b>[Low believes that Germany have succeeded in their bid to bring through new blood that can compete at the Euros]</b> Of course we aim to get as far as possible. Still it is to early to predict anything. But you can say already: To manage an overhaul like we did within only one year is a very positive thing for me. Other nations like France, England or the Netherlands were not able to to do that and it took them two or four years to build a successful team after a change of generations. We finished the Euro Qualifiers top of our group, even though there were big challenges. That’s why this young team gives me hope. We might not be the top favorites in the current constellation, but these tournaments always have their own dynamics, as you know</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Muller ‘not interested’ in Germany call-up after Joachim Low dismisses talk of return]</b> The probability <b>[of a recall]</b> is relatively low if everyone is fit. Thomas has scored a few times in the second half of the season. I am pleased, but I said we would go with the young players. That is what we have to maintain. However, if things should happen that you do not expect, it is clear you will have to look again</p>

  <p><b>[Germany coach Joachim Low on coronavirus]</b> The last few days have kept me very busy and very thoughtful. The world has a collective burnout. Not just individuals, but everyone. I felt that the world or the Earth is a little bit stubborn and resisting against the people. People always think that somehow they know everything, can do everything. The speed, which we humans have set in the last years, could not be increased. Power, greed, profit, even better results and records were in the foreground. Environmental disasters or the forest fires in Australia only touched us in passing. Diseases, Ebola from Africa got stuck somewhere. Now we have experienced something that affects every single person and the whole of humanity. And now we realise in this time that we also have to look at important things<br /><br />We are discovering what counts, namely family, friends, fellow human beings, how we treat each other, how we respect each other. That these are things that also count in life. And that is what we have to look at first and foremost</p>

  <p><b>[Germany boss Joachim Low has revealed that he planned to use <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> star <a href="leon-goretzka.html">Leon Goretzka</a> as a right-back]</b> It was always my idea to use him as a full-back because he can also be this type of player. He’s never played this role. Games and training are necessary for this. Why his dynamism, his feeling for the ball and his understanding of the game, he would be an option. He is a player with a combination of a lot of dynamism, very good technique and good positional ability. From the central position he exudes – and this is what sets him apart – a goal scoring threat because he keeps pushing forward. He knows how to score with his right and left foot, as well as his head. That’s why I think we’ll see him in a more attacking central role in the coming years. He’s very critical and is aware of trends and what’s going on around him. He’s very good to talk to for young players. He’s someone who thinks outside the box and it’s interesting to talk to him. He’s also got a very acute sense of justice</p>
