Jens has not played so much recently. There is no reason to determine the hierarchy at the start of training camp. But if everything goes on as usual, if Jens is in form in the two games before the tournament and he is in top condition, then you can assume that he will be our No. 1. There is a competition for the place between the posts but Jens does have some advantage over the others. But we’ll be looking at the training impressions over the entire two weeks</p>

We have the 2018 World Cup in mind - Mission: Title Defence<br /><br />The decisive factor for me is that we can be on our own as leaders. The goal is to win both games.

  <p><b>[Joachim Low has insisted Mario Gotze remains an important player in his Germany set-up, irrespective of his struggles at Bayern Munich]</b> I told Mario Gotze he should fight for his place at Bayern. There will always be injuries, there will always be chances. In Bayern, there might even be more competition than in our team. As a club coach who has matches every three to four days, you have to look at how the players work together. I am sure that Mario will have a lot of games if you check it at the end of the season. I’ve seen a lot of young players who had a bad patch like Mario had after the World Cup. But Mario always gave everything for us. He lives and breathes football 24 hours a day. He is technically good and has a great sense of direction in confined space. And Mario scores against strong teams like Brazil or Argentina. That is why I trust him.<br /><br />Gundogan played very well against Poland. He gaves us time to breathe by attacking and gave us stability. He is almost back in the form he had two years ago and back then he was superb. Looking at the Euro 2016 he is an extremely important player. If he plays like this, it is hard to replace him</p>

  <p><b>[Joachim Low indicated Ilkay Gundogan will remain behind Sami Khedira in the Germany pecking order]</b> Ilkay came on as a sub and made all the difference in midfield as far as defensive stability is concerned. I can see that he was back to form in the two to three training sessions we had pre-match. I think he is back to where he was two years ago when he was outstanding against Holland in Amsterdam and against France in Paris. This is what makes him an extremely valuable player, he’s very agile, he makes smooth runs, is quick on the turn and I’m very glad to have him as an option, especially when Khedira picks up an injury. So he’s definitely going to be one of my men for Euro 2016 and of course the 2018 World Cup, which is just around the corner<br /><br />For me, coming to Hamden Park is a first, because neither as a player nor as a coach have I been fortunate enough to play in that stadium. That’s why I’m personally looking forward to being there with the unique atmosphere, the great pride and the passion of not just the Scottish players, but also the Scottish public. So we’re all looking forward to the clash on Monday night. Scotland lost their away match to Georgia, but I don’t think it will do their fighting spirit and their passion any damage at all. The crowd will get behind the Scottish team as one man, especially because Scotland after fighting for their last chance somewhat because in the table they have fallen behind Poland and Ireland somewhat</p>

He only thinks of scoring, scoring and scoring. You can’t teach that<br /><br />Of course I expect us to qualify at the next opportunity. I am very happy we won tonight, too. It was difficult for us but, at the end of the match, the reality is that we were the better team. We expected them to do everything because it was maybe their last chance to qualify</p>

We played Ireland several times over the last years and it was never easy. Yes, we won 6-1 once, but the rest were tough matches. I consider them stronger physically and offensively than Scotland. They can make it hard on their opponents and they know how to defend between the spaces. We know their mentality, they fight until the very last minute. We need to find our own solutions and we thought about it: How can we unsettle them and keep them away from the counter? If we manage to do that, we will win this match</p>

It was an unexpected and unnecessary defeat. We talked about these things beforehand. We handled them well all the time. Just that one time we did not and it was a goal. Of course it would have been better to have two or three more training sessions, but that was not the reason for this defeat. In the end we lacked the final commitment in the last third when it was about scoring.</p>

But despite the defeat against Ireland we are on the top of the table and everything lies in our own hands. I am convinced our approach is the right way. Apart from one situation <b>[against Ireland]</b> we did everything well. We just failed to capitalise on our many chances.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany coach Joachim Low paid tribute to the world-class performance of Manuel Neuer in their 2-1 win over Georgia]</b> We can draw the same conclusions as against Ireland. We have again missed three or four chances at the beginning and then came the frustration. From there, some errors crept in and we had big trouble in the second half. Manuel Neuer had to make two or three world-class saves to prevent us from falling behind. We are sometimes not attentive enough. Unfortunately, you have to say we have allowed a few clear chances at the back. In general we can be pleased that we have won the group and managed qualification, but we are not satisfied with the last two games. That is not our standard.</p>

  <p><b>[Joachim Low says the golden chances missed by Marco Reus during Germany’s 2-1 win over Georgia highlight what is going wrong for the nation]</b> Marco is usually an excellent player, who would not miss such opportunities. He has a lot of quality, but he has not taken two or three big chances. Again in this game we have not taken the variety of opportunities we created. We are like a boxer at the moment. We are landing punches but they are not knocking the opponent out.<br /><br />It will take some hard work to get back to the level of performances at the World Cup, but there is a long way to go until the finals and we know that the long period of preparation will do us a lot of good. We are unable to surprise the opponents when they are set in defence, so tactically there are a few things we need to consider. Our style of play will remain mostly the same, but there are some details that need adjusting. It is not our style to send long balls into the box, it would be better to approach the opponents’ goal with combinations. But in France we will meet teams that will attack us, not like some of the defensive sides we have met recently</p>

Ukraine conceded the least goals of all the teams I think and Northern Ireland are very uncomfortable to play against.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if Poland were the strongest team in Group C]</b> I would not say that.

Of course, he still has some room for improvement physically as he is not 100 per cent just yet, but that is only logical. There is still plenty of time until Euro 2016. And he hardly completed a full session with the team during the 2014 World Cup either. He was there when it mattered most, though. He knows his body really well and know what he has to do. He remains hugely ambitious and wants to keep performing at the highest level.<br /><br />There is no agreement with Schweinsteiger that Euro 2016 will be his last tournament for Germany. We don’t discuss things like that before a tournament. It is not an issue at this point</p>

He is very refined and can decide matches<br /><br />Our planning for the Euros is underway. I have a number of young players from the Under-21 squad on my list. Kimmich has already shown what he can do in a number of positions. I see a future for him in a central role, either in central midfield or at centre-back. There is a lot of competition for places.

He will play against Italy. Karim Bellarabi and Julian Draxler trained yesterday. We do not have any squad issues. I want to use this game to get an insight into my players. The result is not so important. We are excited for these two games. They will give us a great perspective of how we can improve.<br /><br />England has developed well in the last few years. Roy Hodgson’s team showed against Switzerland how organised they were. Vardy is a spectacular player. He is always trying to find a gap to get behind the defence. That is very dangerous. We talked about him over the last couple of days, but also England as a whole. Germany against England is a classic. The stadium will be filled with 80,000 people. We are looking forward to it.</p>

There will always be obstacles to overcome and in the next match we have to be much better. In the first half we played very badly, we were not able to impose our usual way of playing, attacking and our passing were not effective in the spaces, there were lots of counter-attacks and we had to get back. We were very vulnerable because we lost balls going forward and that left gaps. In the second half we pressed more but Mexico dropped back and played on the break. We had a couple of shots but it seemed jinxed, sometimes they were too quick in finishing, didn’t keep their cool. Everyone is very unhappy but tomorrow we have to look forward. Our team has experience of dealing with losses, the next match will be decisive and we have to win it<br /><br />We will not change our match plan because if we are able to play out our ideas then we have players who can deliver.

  <p><b>[Joachim Low does not believe Germany can be considered the favourites to win Euro 2020]</b> I think, we can be satisfied with the year. When it comes to the development as a whole, there are surely other nations who are ahead of us. England, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium - those teams had been forced into a big transformation before, because during the last big tournaments, like England for example, they exited early a few times<br /><br />Therefore, those teams have been playing together for three, four years now. The same goes for Netherlands, who have had a well-adjusted team for three, four years. That’s not the case for us at the moment, which is why I don’t see us as the favourites for this tournament. But one thing is for sure, that we’ll try everything, prepare well and that we want to reach the maximum during the tournament<br /><br />No idea. I don’t know what it’ll be next year. Yesterday some of the injured players were here with us. But then there are more players like <a href="niklas-sule.html">Sule</a> and Sane who are doing rehab, where we don’t know how they’re going to be. It’s also important for me, in what shape players are in January, February or March. And then during the months to follow, who’s able to play, who’s in a good rhythm. There are certainly a couple of decisions which I can’t answer today<br /><br /><b>[He believes the matches the team play during the international break in March next year will show where the team is at]</b> It’s no surprise that we want to win the game. Of course, the chance to finish first in the group is a bit of extra motivation. We’ve got some good players who have had some minutes. In terms of a grade, I’d put the year between a B and a C, because it’s nothing special that we’ve qualified. Several of the younger players have improved already. We’ve made some progress. The international games in March will be important again as we play against big nations. We’ll have to wait and see how we perform at the Euros, but I have a good feeling about it</p>

He was always one to pass the ball to, he doesn’t play up front all the time, he lets himself fall back a bit and you can find him anywhere on the pitch and he’s able to play in many different positions. These are prime qualities in any players and also his finishing is technically fantastic. When he was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> he was plagued by injury and all these injuries set him back. But even at the time, around the 2014 World Cup he had always been in my thoughts.

I felt that the world or the Earth is a little bit stubborn and resisting against the people. People always think that somehow they know everything, can do everything. The speed, which we humans have set in the last years, could not be increased. Power, greed, profit, even better results and records were in the foreground. Environmental disasters or the forest fires in Australia only touched us in passing. Diseases, Ebola from Africa got stuck somewhere.

He’s never played this role. Games and training are necessary for this. Why his dynamism, his feeling for the ball and his understanding of the game, he would be an option. He is a player with a combination of a lot of dynamism, very good technique and good positional ability. From the central position he exudes - and this is what sets him apart - a goal scoring threat because he keeps pushing forward. He knows how to score with his right and left foot, as well as his head. That’s why I think we’ll see him in a more attacking central role in the coming years. He’s very critical and is aware of trends and what’s going on around him. He’s very good to talk to for young players. He’s someone who thinks outside the box and it’s interesting to talk to him. He’s also got a very acute sense of justice</p>
