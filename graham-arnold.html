  <p><b>[Graham Arnold to take charge of Olyroos, former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> assistant joins coaching staff]</b> We have some excellent talent emerging in Australia and also many young Australian’s who are playing overseas. Adding the U23’s team to our structure will also mean our younger players are exposed to the same systems and processes from the early stages of their international football development, making the transition into senior international football smoother for them.</p>

  <p><b>[AFC Asian Cup holders Australia name a fresh-looking squad under new coach Graham Arnold]</b> It is exciting that 15 of the 23 players in the squad will be attending their first AFC Asian Cup, and I am expecting that Australian fans will see some great performances from our kids throughout the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Mooy missing for Australia as injury ends Asian Cup hopes]</b> It is disappointing to lose Aaron for the tournament. However, it was important that we left no stone unturned in exploring every option to get Aaron on the pitch for Australia in the UAE.<br /><br />We will remain in close contact with Aaron and <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> during his rehabilitation and trust that he will make a successful return to action. In making the assessment on the injury we agreed Aaron would need at least another month to return to fitness. In a best-case scenario, this would mean he would not be ready to play until after the quarter-final stage <b>[January 24-25, 2019]</b>.<br /><br />With so many games in such a short period we felt it would be best to bring in a player that is fully fit and ready to go from the outset<br /><br /><b>[Mooy’s misfortune means opportunity knocks for Austria Vienna’s Jeggo]</b> James has been performing really well in Austria and is a fantastic character, so we are very happy to have him join the squad. Initially James was very unlucky to miss out, but sometimes these things happen in football and we are glad we can provide him with this opportunity. James has thrived at club level playing in a defensive midfield role and with three attacking central midfielders already in the squad, we felt we needed someone with James’ attributes to provide some depth in that area</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Arnold expects his Socceroos squad to lift their level considerably over the coming weeks, conceding they are currently functioning at just 45 percent of their full potential]</b> We’re functioning only at the moment at about 45 percent and there’s a lot more to go, so it’s up to me to get the best out of those players and raise the level even more. They’re all fighting and fit and they’ve done a great job in those last three camps but I do know that they’ve got so much more in them. I expect a lot of players will stand up at this tournament and show their worth<br /><br /><b>[An ideal warm-up for the Socceroos, Arnold revealed he’s set to give as many players some game time as possible]</b> There will be wholesale changes for the game in both halves. It’s about getting minutes on the pitch. Everyone is fighting for places. It’s the players’ jobs on Sunday against Oman to give me a lot of headaches</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold reveals Socceroos want to play like Liverpool]</b> I’ve been studying <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> a lot - that’s the system and the style we want to play. We expect every time we go on the pitch that we’re on the front foot. We’ve got not only four goalscorers up front, but saw Jackson Irvine score from six, Massimo Luongo can score from six. It’s more the patterns we’re playing and they’ll get much better. Tonight was okay. There’s a lot of improvement left in the side and a lot of work to do this week.</p>

  <p><b>[Australia welcome winger Mathew Leckie and defender Josh Risdon back from injury for their clash with Uzbekistan at the Asian Cup]</b> The wonderful thing is Mathew Leckie is back and he will be on the bench. It’s like signing a new player halfway through a tournament. We planned when he got injured at Hertha Berlin that we needed to look at how the injury would come along. We were patient with that and our medical staff have done a great job getting him ready. And that, with his positive attitude and how he is in camp and in around the boys, has given the boys a lift already.<br /><br />Josh Risdon is back again, so he will be back, and Trent Sainsbury is back from suspension. Andrew Nabbout is the only one out at this stage so we’re getting stronger and stronger as the tournament goes.<br /><br />We’re into the last 16, so it’s a step up in the competition and a step up in the tournament and I expect our team to step up another level as well. But we’ve analysed them and we expect to expose their weaknesses. They’ve had a three-day turnaround and we’ve had five so we’re mentally fresh and feel great and are ready to go for this game.</p>

We have just started a great four-year journey with the Socceroos and the Australian under-23 national team. I saw a lot of growth in our team and many individuals at the AFC Asian Cup and while we were disappointed not to go further in the competition I am extremely proud of our players and staff.</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold names six debutants in experimental Socceroos squad]</b> The upcoming camp and friendly international in Korea Republic provides us the opportunity to expose more players to international football, which is vital as we prepare for a long qualification campaign<br /><br />We have seen how arduous the previous World Cup path was for our squad and it is imperative that we spend this valuable time together to have a close look and some of our next generation.<br /><br />We have eleven players in this squad who have all had excellent seasons in the domestic competition and my message to those playing in the Hyundai A-League is that if you are playing regularly and consistently for your club, you will come into consideration for the next phase of World Cup qualifiers</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold makes bold call about his Australia side]</b> Every time I’ve coached and every time I have played, my mindset is always going on the field expecting to win the game, and nothing changes<br /><br />Things can happen in games but you send the players out in a great mindset and going out and expecting to win the game. I don’t send players out trying not to lose. There’s a big difference between the two. We have a great environment, the team morale is great. It’s a new journey for a lot of players. For the more experienced players it’s a journey they have been on and that will help those younger players. It’s an exciting squad, a mixture of experience and youth but it’s all about giving people the opportunity to take the Socceroos to another level. In my mindset, I believe that at the end of this we’ll be the greatest Socceroos team ever<br /><br />Whether we play with three nines, very narrow, or two wingers high and wide, and two eights, or with two sixes, it’s all about the quality in the final third. We’ve shown in the past since I’ve been in charge we’ve dominated and created every game. I got an independent review of our performances that I will show the players this week that will show we’ve dictated every game in terms of possession, shots, final third entries and it’s just about being ruthless and using that individual quality.<br /><br />We have players that can make a difference and that’s a big thing. When you are playing against packed defences and you don’t have that individual quality of a one-v-one action that can go past players, it makes it tough. But we have that now and I have a lot of belief in these boys and the front third of the pitch is something we’ll work hard on this camp.<br /><br />We’ve worked hard in the previous camps on our defensive structure, how to press and how to build up, but this camp we will work a lot on our combination play and attacking play and I look forward to that</p>

  <p><b>[Milligan withdrawn from Socceroos squad]</b> We didn’t want to take any risks with Mark so we arranged for him to travel back to his club for ongoing care. Thomas was with us in October and November last year, and in June in Busan. He has now arrived in Kuwait and will provide a great defensive option for our squad</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold questions introducing more A-League foreigners]</b> Inside a salary cap do you think it’s good? Do you think the fourth and fifth foreigner in every club now is good? Is it high quality? So what’s the sixth one going to be like. I’m not going to say that the youngsters in the Olyroos should play week in, week out, in the A-League if they don’t deserve to, if they’re not good enough. But give them somewhere to play like a reserve-grade competition or something</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold praises ‘fantastic’ mentality after Socceroos thrash Kuwait]</b> I thought the first half was excellent. We came out with all intention to be on the front foot. We pressed them very well, we worked them really well, we didn’t let them really have any chances, and obviously second half it was a bit less.<br /><br />The mentality of the boys was fantastic, but in these conditions you could see the fatigue kick in and I thought the three subs that came on made a big difference.<br /><br />The energy that the young boys have brought into camp has been great. We had a number of inexperienced players out there that are gaining great experience here in the Middle East and it is a great start to the campaign</p>

Trent is managing a minor injury but remains on stand-by for the squad should we need to call him in. Bailey is a big part of our plans and a great player and person to have in the squad, so we are pleased that he will be with us this month</p>

  <p><b>[Man City starlet Daniel Arzani sounded Celtic loan warning ahead of January transfer window]</b> <a href="rene-meulensteen.html">Rene Meulensteen</a>, my assistant, went up to Celtic and sat with <a href="neil-lennon.html">Neil Lennon</a> and they rate him highly. They love him. They think that he is a special player but at the end of the day it’s all about getting those opportunities on the pitch and getting game time and I think that will come to the forefront over the next six months. It’s an important six months for Daniel before potentially the January transfer window that he gets game time. Celtic obviously are a strong club and have got a lot of depth. Daniel is under no illusions that he has to work extremely hard to get in that side<br /><br />Daniel Arzani is one of those players who has been incredibly exciting and particularly leading up to the World Cup in 2018. He had a phenomenal breakthrough season in the A-League. He didn’t play enough games over 90 minutes, which is something he needs to build on. The Celtic move is one which I am not sure is the best move for him just yet. But it is about playing games and continuing to develop. His injury came at the very worst time as he just arrived and got his first opportunity to play from the start. It was not only unfortunate for his career at Celtic but also for Australia. I just hope that he can get back to the level he was at before his injury</p>
