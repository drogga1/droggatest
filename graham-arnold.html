  <p><b>[Sydney FC are still keen on securing Rhys Williams from Perth Glory]</b> It seems that Rhys is unhappy. It’s clear he’s not playing over there and for me Rhys is a national team player. I haven’t had any personal contact with him. I can only see from afar but when he’s playing youth team for Perth I can imagine he’s not happy. Would we like to have him? Yeah if they don’t want him we’d love to have him but it’s out of our hands.<br /><br />We’ve got some fantastic Under 20 kids. Patrick Flottman and George Timotheou are international players. They have been waiting for their chance for a long time and have worked extremely hard at training. They are part of the youth team that won six trophies last year. They are very good at what they do. Aaron Calver <b>[who turned 21 on Thursday]</b> is back and got a lot of experience in the A-League for a young kid. We have plenty of options and I’m very happy with them</p>

He is a free-kick specialist and like our other four foreign players we expect him to improve our squad enormously. He was unfortunate that his last club in Romania went bankrupt last month, but it means he comes to us fit and ready to play. He has a good reputation and comes highly recommended from our Dutch network of contacts.</b></p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC and their coach Graham Arnold were at rock bottom at the end of the 2015-16 A-League regular season]</b> My belief is so high and has been for the past few years, the players run off my belief and they believe in themselves. If you speak to my players, I don’t tell them what to say anymore at press conferences and interviews. I used to tell them don’t say ‘hope’ or ‘want’, but instead say ‘will’ and other positive words. Now I don’t even talk to them about it, they just do it.<br /><br />We started seeing miracles happen. The penalty shootout last year, I knew it was going to happen. I know it sounds weird but you can get to a stage where you can expect things and predict things. That’s down to the self belief that has been built.<br /><br /><b>[While they have a similar amount of points and goals difference now compared with the same stage last season]</b> I can’t see a trophy in the cabinet for 2017-18. Where is it? It’s all about getting greater and greater. You have done nothing yet. You haven’t achieved anything this season. I say that to my players today. You are in a great position but we’ve achieved nothing. It’s all about what we do from here going forward. Don’t rest on your laurels and the past. It’s all about being greater as individuals and as a team.</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold recognises his team’s performance needs to improve]</b> We need a much better performance than we had tonight. The hard work isn’t over yet. We’ve had a lot of football of late but we have got to recover and get ready for Tuesday <b>[Asian Champions League match against Shanghai Shenhua]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Arnold lauded his team’s achievement]</b> Everyone said at the start of the year we won’t have a season like we did last year. Okay, we ended up two points less but we ended up scoring more goals in the season. We’ve had a fantastic season but now it’s about refocusing and getting on with the job Tuesday night<br /><br />Those two weeks weren’t anything other than players just switched off a little bit. Media can buckle the players. They read newspapers, they read social media. It was about just talking to them about what reality is. We want to finish this off in a great way and we will do that. It’s a matter of getting greater and greater every time we play</p>

  <p><b>[The Tottenham rejection behind Socceroos goalkeeper Mat Ryan’s rise to the top]</b> He was always panicking and we had many conversations. He felt that he wasn’t tall enough to play in the English Premier League. He went to Tottenham for a trial and the feedback was he’s only <b>[184cm]</b> and in the UK <b>[they]</b> want goalkeepers that are 195cm. I think he felt that was something that could have stood in his way.<br /><br />I think he felt the Valencia move was a failure. It wasn’t a failure, it was a lesson in life. If you look at those things that certain way, then it can bring you down. So I talk to him quite a bit now and I’ve got a guy that works with him as well that helps him mentally. Gives him the belief, the confidence and a mentor to talk to. What he’s dong at Brighton…he’s doing the whole country proud</p>

In making the assessment on the injury we agreed Aaron would need at least another month to return to fitness. In a best-case scenario, this would mean he would not be ready to play until after the quarter-final stage <b>[January 24-25, 2019]</b>.<br /><br />With so many games in such a short period we felt it would be best to bring in a player that is fully fit and ready to go from the outset<br /><br /><b>[<a href="aaron-mooy.html">Mooy</a>’s misfortune means opportunity knocks for Austria Vienna’s Jeggo]</b> James has been performing really well in Austria and is a fantastic character, so we are very happy to have him join the squad. Initially James was very unlucky to miss out, but sometimes these things happen in football and we are glad we can provide him with this opportunity. James has thrived at club level playing in a defensive midfield role and with three attacking central midfielders already in the squad, we felt we needed someone with James’ attributes to provide some depth in that area</p>

They’re all fighting and fit and they’ve done a great job in those last three camps but I do know that they’ve got so much more in them. I expect a lot of players will stand up at this tournament and show their worth<br /><br /><b>[An ideal warm-up for the Socceroos, Arnold revealed he’s set to give as many players some game time as possible]</b> There will be wholesale changes for the game in both halves. It’s about getting minutes on the pitch. Everyone is fighting for places. It’s the players’ jobs on Sunday against Oman to give me a lot of headaches</p>

We expect every time we go on the pitch that we’re on the front foot. We’ve got not only four goalscorers up front, but saw Jackson Irvine score from six, Massimo Luongo can score from six. It’s more the patterns we’re playing and they’ll get much better. Tonight was okay. There’s a lot of improvement left in the side and a lot of work to do this week.</p>

  <p><b>[Australia welcome winger Mathew Leckie and defender Josh Risdon back from injury for their clash with Uzbekistan at the Asian Cup]</b> The wonderful thing is Mathew Leckie is back and he will be on the bench. It’s like signing a new player halfway through a tournament. We planned when he got injured at <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a> that we needed to look at how the injury would come along. We were patient with that and our medical staff have done a great job getting him ready. And that, with his positive attitude and how he is in camp and in around the boys, has given the boys a lift already.<br /><br />Josh Risdon is back again, so he will be back, and Trent Sainsbury is back from suspension. Andrew Nabbout is the only one out at this stage so we’re getting stronger and stronger as the tournament goes.<br /><br />We’re into the last 16, so it’s a step up in the competition and a step up in the tournament and I expect our team to step up another level as well. But we’ve analysed them and we expect to expose their weaknesses. They’ve had a three-day turnaround and we’ve had five so we’re mentally fresh and feel great and are ready to go for this game.</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold makes bold call about his Australia side]</b> Every time I’ve coached and every time I have played, my mindset is always going on the field expecting to win the game, and nothing changes<br /><br />Things can happen in games but you send the players out in a great mindset and going out and expecting to win the game. I don’t send players out trying not to lose. There’s a big difference between the two. We have a great environment, the team morale is great. It’s a new journey for a lot of players. For the more experienced players it’s a journey they have been on and that will help those younger players. It’s an exciting squad, a mixture of experience and youth but it’s all about giving people the opportunity to take the Socceroos to another level. In my mindset, I believe that at the end of this we’ll be the greatest Socceroos team ever<br /><br />Whether we play with three nines, very narrow, or two wingers high and wide, and two eights, or with two sixes, it’s all about the quality in the final third. We’ve shown in the past since I’ve been in charge we’ve dominated and created every game. I got an independent review of our performances that I will show the players this week that will show we’ve dictated every game in terms of possession, shots, final third entries and it’s just about being ruthless and using that individual quality.<br /><br />We have players that can make a difference and that’s a big thing. When you are playing against packed defences and you don’t have that individual quality of a one-v-one action that can go past players, it makes it tough. But we have that now and I have a lot of belief in these boys and the front third of the pitch is something we’ll work hard on this camp.<br /><br />We’ve worked hard in the previous camps on our defensive structure, how to press and how to build up, but this camp we will work a lot on our combination play and attacking play and I look forward to that</p>

I’m not going to say that the youngsters in the Olyroos should play week in, week out, in the A-League if they don’t deserve to, if they’re not good enough.

We had a number of inexperienced players out there that are gaining great experience here in the Middle East and it is a great start to the campaign</p>
