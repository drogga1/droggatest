  <p><b>[Sydney FC are still keen on securing Rhys Williams from Perth Glory]</b> It seems that Rhys is unhappy. It’s clear he’s not playing over there and for me Rhys is a national team player. I haven’t had any personal contact with him. I can only see from afar but when he’s playing youth team for Perth I can imagine he’s not happy. Would we like to have him? Yeah if they don’t want him we’d love to have him but it’s out of our hands.<br /><br />We’ve got some fantastic Under 20 kids. Patrick Flottman and George Timotheou are international players. They have been waiting for their chance for a long time and have worked extremely hard at training. They are part of the youth team that won six trophies last year. They are very good at what they do. Aaron Calver <b>[who turned 21 on Thursday]</b> is back and got a lot of experience in the A-League for a young kid. We have plenty of options and I’m very happy with them</p>

He comes with a very strong pedigree of over 200 games in the top-flight Eredivisie in Holland. He is a free-kick specialist and like our other four foreign players we expect him to improve our squad enormously. He was unfortunate that his last club in Romania went bankrupt last month, but it means he comes to us fit and ready to play. He has a good reputation and comes highly recommended from our Dutch network of contacts.</b></p>

Don’t think it was a penalty.<br /><br />Happy with the display but not with the result. A good derby, a passionate derby, a lot of fight. Two teams that played well and West Sydney Wanderers performed well. You’ve got to give them credit, they made it hard for us at times. They performed to their best tonight, but our execution let us down tonight. But I couldn’t be prouder of the way we worked and played. We were very good tonight and we’ll get better</p>

Calver has played at right back for us on occasion, Jordy Buijs’ clearance has come through, Josh Brillante played for 6-8 months in Serie B in Italy at right-back so we’ve got plenty of options. The Dutchman <b>[Buijs]</b> will be in the squad. Whether he starts or comes off the bench is another thing<br /><br />We know that Melbourne are going to come out fighting, we’re ready for that fight, we’ve got the players that are prepared for the fight. You’ve got to win the battle, you’ve got to win the fight for the second ball, you’ve got to be prepared for the physical battle<br /><br />We’re not even thinking about the Premier’s Plate. It’s one game at a time and we know that Melbourne are going to come out fighting and we’ve got the players who are prepared for the fight</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold refused to discuss the premiership]</b> We have 30 points to go. And it’s good to hear the boys say they felt they didn’t play anywhere near their best. And to still come down here and win 2-1 is a great sign. But we have a lot to work on. For me, it’s about getting better each week and we want to be peaking at the right time. I just said to the chairman <b>[of Sydney FC]</b>, we’re finding different ways to win. We found a way to win. I’m driving the players to be the best in A-League history. In a ten-team competition the most <b>[points]</b> returned has been 57 and we want to beat that. So we don’t talk about coming first or the Premier’s Plate, it’s all about getting more than 57 points.<br /><br /><b>[Sydney have 43 points with 10 games to go]</b> We’re finding different ways to win. Tonight was a dogfight. We found a way to win. It was pretty even, the dogfight. It was a hard pitch to play on. The pitch was quick, the ball bounced and grass was very short so it became a game of second balls. And we had to make sure we were up for the fight with Melbourne tonight. We matched the fight with them<br /><br /><b>[Dutch defender Jordy Buijs made his A-League debut]</b> I think you saw 25 per cent of Jordy tonight. We worked hard this week at training to get Jordy used to playing in the team and the tactics next to <b>[Alex]</b> Wilkinson and <b>[Aaron]</b> Calver</p>

On another night we could have had five or six, but that’s where we’re aiming to be. I keep saying we’re only 50, 60, 70 per cent of where we’ll end up as a team.</p>

I’ve been saying it for the last six or seven weeks that we’re only functioning on 60 or 70 per cent, but the way the boys have trained this week I can see a big step up tomorrow night. The boys will step up to 80 per cent tomorrow night or even more. The enthusiasm and intensity in the training sessions, the quality, have been nearly the highest I’ve ever seen coaching in the A-League and that’s all down to the belief of the players.<br /><br />It’s one against seven and we’re 26 points in front and that’s the reality<br /><br />I analysed the Wanderers over the last four or five weeks and our last game against them and they did well against us last time but that’s history. I thought it was just a stalemate. We both cancelled each other out, but I just think we’ve improved enormously since then</p>

Ninko’s in a good headspace at the moment. He’s such a fantastic person, he’s enjoying life here in Sydney, he loves the club and he can see what we do for him to be able to perform at the level he’s at. We’ve had discussions and they are he wants to wait until the end of the season. He wants to have one thing on his mind and that’s winning. That’s all we’re doing at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Asked where Ninkovic sits in terms of the best players to have graced the A-League]</b> Top five, definitely. He’s exceptional. He’s a player, like <b>[Diego]</b> Castro from Perth, you pay your money to go and watch because he does things on a football field that is top European quality<br /><br />The only thing we’re looking at is winning the game on Friday night. It <b>[the premiership]</b> hasn’t been discussed and to be honest it hasn’t been thought about. We set our goals at the start of the year and 58 points is what we’re looking at and the rest will take care of itself. Muscat’s doing a good job and they are a good side but we feel we’re in great shape mentally, tactically, physically and we expect to win</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold has called on called on full-back Rhyan Grant to find a new level to his play]</b> Once you get to international level it’s about the four pillars - technical, tactical, physical and mental. And a lot of it is about athleticism and he <b>[Grant]</b> has that. He can run all day, he’s quick, he’s aggressive and he’s improving out of sight with his decision-making and last ball.<br /><br />He could probably have had double figures as goals as a right full-back, which shows how far he is getting forward down the pitch. Ange has always shown he likes full-backs that can get forward. He <b>[Grant]</b> fits the model but now it’s about the concentration side for 90 minutes and stepping up to a new level<br /><br />As I said to him yesterday,’if I had said that to you six months ago you wouldn’t have believed it and now you have that opportunity’. What he has done well for us is what he has to do well at international level. Ange has picked him on his capabilities and what he’s good at and nothing changes. They <b>[Grant and Vukovic]</b> have the opportunity to be part of a World Cup and be part of a Confeds Cup and it’s about how bad they want it</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC focus is Perth not Premiership trophy]</b> I still believe we’ve got improvement left in us - a lot of improvement. We know we’ve got six weeks to go, six weeks that we’re pushing to win all six games. There’s a huge amount of belief in the squad. The players believe enormously in each other which is crucial, so I expect our form to pick up over the next six weeks to finish this off.<br /><br />Until we get the three points on Sunday and perform to the best of our ability, there’s no trophies being handed out yet. I don’t want to think about those things until we actually achieve it. It’s about preparation for the Perth game. We enjoy the trip to Perth; we’ve had a lot of good success over there in the past. We expect to do that again on Sunday<br /><br />I have absolute 100 percent faith in anyone I put out on the field. Obviously Andrew Redmayne will come in for Danny Vukovic. Redmayne has trained exceptionally well - he’s back working with <b>[goalkeeping coach]</b> John Crawley who’s pretty much developed his career for him. I expect all the players I put on the pitch to perform at 100 percent of their ability</p>

We’ve got three games to go. Brisbane Roar in an 11-team competition got 65, so we’ll chase that.<br /><br />It’s obviously a wonderful achievement by the players and the staff and the club to win the premiership with four rounds to go and for me it was about attitude today, it was about standards. We’ve set ourselves high standards all year and it was about maintaining those standards at all costs. So for me, the standards were very good. I thought our performance was excellent and we totally dominated<br /><br />I had to get them out of their seat when <b>[Roar defeated Victory and]</b> they were eating dinner to congratulate each other because they only wanted to win today.

In a best-case scenario, this would mean he would not be ready to play until after the quarter-final stage <b>[January 24-25, 2019]</b>.<br /><br />With so many games in such a short period we felt it would be best to bring in a player that is fully fit and ready to go from the outset<br /><br /><b>[<a href="aaron-mooy.html">Mooy</a>’s misfortune means opportunity knocks for Austria Vienna’s Jeggo]</b> James has been performing really well in Austria and is a fantastic character, so we are very happy to have him join the squad. Initially James was very unlucky to miss out, but sometimes these things happen in football and we are glad we can provide him with this opportunity. James has thrived at club level playing in a defensive midfield role and with three attacking central midfielders already in the squad, we felt we needed someone with James’ attributes to provide some depth in that area</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Arnold expects his Socceroos squad to lift their level considerably over the coming weeks, conceding they are currently functioning at just 45 percent of their full potential]</b> We’re functioning only at the moment at about 45 percent and there’s a lot more to go, so it’s up to me to get the best out of those players and raise the level even more. They’re all fighting and fit and they’ve done a great job in those last three camps but I do know that they’ve got so much more in them. I expect a lot of players will stand up at this tournament and show their worth<br /><br /><b>[An ideal warm-up for the Socceroos, Arnold revealed he’s set to give as many players some game time as possible]</b> There will be wholesale changes for the game in both halves. It’s about getting minutes on the pitch. Everyone is fighting for places. It’s the players’ jobs on Sunday against Oman to give me a lot of headaches</p>

We expect every time we go on the pitch that we’re on the front foot. We’ve got not only four goalscorers up front, but saw Jackson Irvine score from six, Massimo Luongo can score from six. It’s more the patterns we’re playing and they’ll get much better. Tonight was okay. There’s a lot of improvement left in the side and a lot of work to do this week.</p>

  <p><b>[Australia welcome winger Mathew Leckie and defender Josh Risdon back from injury for their clash with Uzbekistan at the Asian Cup]</b> The wonderful thing is Mathew Leckie is back and he will be on the bench. It’s like signing a new player halfway through a tournament. We planned when he got injured at <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a> that we needed to look at how the injury would come along. We were patient with that and our medical staff have done a great job getting him ready. And that, with his positive attitude and how he is in camp and in around the boys, has given the boys a lift already.<br /><br />Josh Risdon is back again, so he will be back, and Trent Sainsbury is back from suspension. Andrew Nabbout is the only one out at this stage so we’re getting stronger and stronger as the tournament goes.<br /><br />We’re into the last 16, so it’s a step up in the competition and a step up in the tournament and I expect our team to step up another level as well. But we’ve analysed them and we expect to expose their weaknesses. They’ve had a three-day turnaround and we’ve had five so we’re mentally fresh and feel great and are ready to go for this game.</p>

We crave these opportunities as players and coaches. The experience we will gain from playing in this tournament will be incredible and I know by speaking to our players, they are equally excited about being part of one of the World’s most prestigious football tournaments. Our planning for the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup Qatar has already started.

  <p><b>[Arnold makes bold call about his Australia side]</b> Every time I’ve coached and every time I have played, my mindset is always going on the field expecting to win the game, and nothing changes<br /><br />Things can happen in games but you send the players out in a great mindset and going out and expecting to win the game. I don’t send players out trying not to lose. There’s a big difference between the two. We have a great environment, the team morale is great. It’s a new journey for a lot of players. For the more experienced players it’s a journey they have been on and that will help those younger players. It’s an exciting squad, a mixture of experience and youth but it’s all about giving people the opportunity to take the Socceroos to another level. In my mindset, I believe that at the end of this we’ll be the greatest Socceroos team ever<br /><br />Whether we play with three nines, very narrow, or two wingers high and wide, and two eights, or with two sixes, it’s all about the quality in the final third. We’ve shown in the past since I’ve been in charge we’ve dominated and created every game. I got an independent review of our performances that I will show the players this week that will show we’ve dictated every game in terms of possession, shots, final third entries and it’s just about being ruthless and using that individual quality.<br /><br />We have players that can make a difference and that’s a big thing. When you are playing against packed defences and you don’t have that individual quality of a one-v-one action that can go past players, it makes it tough. But we have that now and I have a lot of belief in these boys and the front third of the pitch is something we’ll work hard on this camp.<br /><br />We’ve worked hard in the previous camps on our defensive structure, how to press and how to build up, but this camp we will work a lot on our combination play and attacking play and I look forward to that</p>

Is it high quality? So what’s the sixth one going to be like. I’m not going to say that the youngsters in the Olyroos should play week in, week out, in the A-League if they don’t deserve to, if they’re not good enough. But give them somewhere to play like a reserve-grade competition or something</p>

  <p><b>[Arnold praises ‘fantastic’ mentality after Socceroos thrash Kuwait]</b> I thought the first half was excellent. We came out with all intention to be on the front foot. We pressed them very well, we worked them really well, we didn’t let them really have any chances, and obviously second half it was a bit less.<br /><br />The mentality of the boys was fantastic, but in these conditions you could see the fatigue kick in and I thought the three subs that came on made a big difference.<br /><br />The energy that the young boys have brought into camp has been great. We had a number of inexperienced players out there that are gaining great experience here in the Middle East and it is a great start to the campaign</p>

Trent is managing a minor injury but remains on stand-by for the squad should we need to call him in.

The <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> move is one which I am not sure is the best move for him just yet. But it is about playing games and continuing to develop.
