From winning the Championship to our two seasons in the Premier League, fans, staff and players have all been United. I wanted to stay, but I didn’t just want to sign an extended contract, I wanted to be part of a project. Unfortunately, it became increasingly clear to me that those at the top of the Club did not share the same vision.

  <p><b>[Rafa Benitez has been officially appointed as the new coach of Dalian Yifang after leaving Premier League club Newcastle]</b> I’m sad because Newcastle has been my home. If Liverpool is where my family live, then Newcastle will always be my other home. You can sell a house, but you can never sell a home. To have that connection with a city and fans, it’s strange and difficult to lose that. I feel like an honorary Geordie now.<br /><br />In your career, you come to understand that football is a business, so you have to be professional, but sometimes it’s about the relationship with fans. I was lucky to have that in Valencia and Tenerife, in Napoli and Liverpool, and Newcastle was the same. In our bad runs, it meant I could stay calm and do my job. They were behind us. It is difficult to say goodbye, to say goodbye to that feeling. <br /><br />I have just a . . . not regret, but a little bit of disappointment that I couldn’t go higher. I’m really pleased with what we did with the resources we had, with all the things around - everybody knows it’s not easy - but I’m just disappointed we couldn’t achieve more, that we couldn’t compete and reach the real potential of this fantastic club.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Newcastle United coach Rafa Benitez has stressed his decision to join Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang wasn’t for the money]</b> I have had offers of greater financial significance during my career, but they weren’t the project I was looking for. What I have found at Dalian is an incredible project that has arrived at the perfect time and this has been a major factor in my decision. We’ve accepted the challenge of leading a superb project with the full backing and confidence of the club’s leadership team. Over the last years many players and coaches I know have arrived in China, so I have been able to follow the Super League as much as possible.<br /><br />It’s a competition with its unique qualities so we will have to know how to adapt, but our path forward is clear. Dalian Yifang is an historic club in one of the most football passionate cities in the country, so this is an added attraction. Everyone says how loyal the Dalian fans are and we’ve witnessed this passion for the club from the very first moment. Without doubt coming to a club with such great supporters was another key in making this commitment<br /><br /><b>[That’s an issue the 59-year-old clearly doesn’t think he’ll have with Dalian, who boast star players Yannick Carrasco and Marek Hamsik]</b> This club has all the components that we were looking for to start a new chapter with the maximum motivation. Among the directors of the club I have found people who value my track record, such as the chairman of the Wanda Group, Mr. Wang, who is keen to grow this club as much as possible, develop a tremendous project and support this growth with all the necessary resources. We share the same ambition of developing a great project here and leave a legacy in Dalian</p>

I can only offer them my gratitude. I showed my commitment from day one and they supported me all the time - even when things on the pitch were not going well. They supported the team and me. I sincerely hope they can achieve their potential. They deserve the best they can get.</p>

As we all know from experience, in football, just as in everyday life, when people show you respect and affection and do everything they can to make things easier for you, life is much happier, even when you face difficult moments. I must say that I have had more meetings with the chairman, the president and the general manager this week than I had in three years at Newcastle. They haven’t just been work meetings, rather signs of respect in which we have been able to appreciate the differences and similarities in our cultures<br /><br /><b>[Benitez got his reign off to a positive start on the field with a 3-1 win over Henan Jianye on Sunday]</b> We’ve hardly been in China for a week and I have seen and experienced so much for the first time, it could easily have already been a month. My coaching team and I have visited so many countries in the past and we’ve worked for years in Spain, Italy and England. But this experience is like no other. Before leading a training session or managing a match I have found some challenges that I haven’t experienced in the other countries where I have worked or visited. Most of the players and the people around you don’t understand anything you say and vice versa, so you need a translator by your side at all times, even to transmit the smallest correction in training</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael Benitez has lifted the lid on his acrimonious departure from Newcastle United]</b> ple in Newcastle have been talking about my decision to move to China without knowing what happened behind the scenes during my three years at St James’ Park. I haven’t wanted to say too much about that - I’ve encouraged supporters to get behind Steve Bruce and his new team - but I’ve been made aware of what Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director, claimed in the club’s match programme last weekend and I think it’s important I address that. Hopefully, it will be the last time I have to do so. In the future I want to write about football and nothing but football.<br /><br />When I joined Newcastle in 2016, I did it with all my heart. I could feel the history and see the potential of the club and I wanted to be part of a project and to stay close to my family on Merseyside. I tried to do my best every day, even staying when we went down to the Championship and saying no to other offers - bigger offers than the one I recently accepted with Dalian Yifang, by the way. If I was only interested in moving ‘for money’, as Charnley stated, I could have done it much earlier. Over my long career, and especially in my time at Newcastle, I’ve always shown commitment to my club, its city and its community and I’ve done it with professionalism and honesty. I want to remember the good moments I spent in the north east - and there were many of them - and not have to keep denying things about my time there or about my departure.<br /><br />Newcastle’s board had a year to sort out my contract but, when we met after the end of last season, they didn’t make me an offer I could accept. They told me they didn’t want to invest in the academy or the training ground - if they like, I can explain the reason why Mike Ashley refused to do that. Their idea of a project was a policy of signing players under 24 and, in my opinion, the budget available was not enough to compete for the top 10. After that meeting, I knew they would not come back with a serious offer and, when it arrived, 19 days later, it was for the same salary as three years earlier and with less control over signings. Charnley’s comments in the programme about having a deal agreed for Joelinton in February explains a lot that I couldn’t understand at that time. After three years of unfulfilled promises, I didn’t trust them.<br /><br />When we finished 10th in the Premier League in our first season back, all players and staff were paid a bonus - aside from my coaching team. That felt like a punishment for me not signing an extension. So, by the end, I knew there would not be a proper offer and they knew I was not signing. I couldn’t explain that in public because I was not allowed to talk to the press without their permission, so I was waiting until late June, like every fan, hoping there would be good news about Newcastle’s prospective takeover. The time was passing and we were losing job opportunities in Europe. I couldn’t wait forever. I’m a family man and I have a responsibility to them, my staff, Paco Francisco de Míguel Moreno, Antonio Gomez and Mikel Antia, and their families, too. I don’t like to gamble with the future of my people. In front of us we had three options: nothing serious from Newcastle, the hope of a possible takeover or a different project. Yes, it was a big offer in China - I have never denied that - but it was also another continent and another league, from a club giving us a lot of recognition and respect. That decision wasn’t easy, but it was clear</p>

Why I decided to stay in <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> after relegation is because we beat <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> 5-1 in the last game with 10 players and the atmosphere was amazing. You could hear the fans, the staff, the players and the togetherness between everyone. That is what I was looking for. If in the future, people were talking about our first game here when we had 30,000 people. After two or three games we then had 55,000 people so I like to see the fans enjoying the game, the passion and the commitment of the players.

I’m really pleased (with my current job), they trust me, they have a lot of staff working on a big, big project. The league is different, it is another level.

  <p><b>[Benitez backs ‘consistent’ <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win long-awaited <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title]</b> I think so. I think that they are doing so well. They are very consistent. It is very difficult for them to lose games, especially to lose games in a row for sure. They have been signing the right players over the past year, spending money obviously, but (on) very good players in the right positions and the ones the manager was looking for<br /><br /><b>[When asked what was the secret to their success Benitez, who managed the Reds between 2004 and 2010]</b> They have a very good balance. So it’s not just that they have good defenders or people are just talking about the goalkeeper. The full-backs go forward, the strikers have pace and ability, and the midfielders press all the time. As soon as they attack you, if they give the ball away they are pressing you so it is very difficult to counter-attack and create something. If you are a team that has plenty of possession they are so aggressive, it is not easy. If you are a team that wants to play counter-attack they are so quick. We tried that with <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but we couldn’t go in behind them because they were faster than our players</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael Benitez says he would be open to taking the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> job in the future despite being a former manager of Merseyside rivals Liverpool]</b> Obviously I have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> connections, that is very clear. But at the same time we are involved in the city, we have a lot of friends in the city, Evertonians and Liverpudlians. So I don’t have any problem with the fans, with the people there.

What I wanted to say was a small team, because in this game I remember they had one chance and nearly they won and they were (defending) too deep. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans were happy and the Evertonians were upset. But I didn’t want to say they were a small club, I wanted to say they were a small team.

At no time did I tell him how he had to take them. The only conversation I had with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> about free-kicks was in Australia, during pre-season. I told him we had analysed, together with my goalkeeper coach, the free-kicks he took when he was at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and the trajectory of the ball in relation to the position of the wall. Our idea then, as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> coaches, was to try to counter their <b>[United’s]</b> free-kicks. But that’s it. At no time, as coach of Madrid, did I tell <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a> how free-kicks should be taken<br /><br />I only told him that, of course, when you have a simple pass, you have to hit it with the inside <b>[of your foot]</b> because then it’s easier for your team-mate.

However, it’s very easy to release lies and make them appear true<br /><br />I went a long time without talking about the club. In one moment, it occurred to me to say something… and it seemed as though I couldn’t say what I thought. Therefore, what I do is not talk about Madrid. I focus on the future, which is Dalian.

  <p><b>[Benitez reveals strange elevator superstition ahead of Champions League glory]</b> I still think about standing in the team hotel before the game, waiting for one of the elevators to take us down to the lobby. I was saying, ‘If this lift comes, we will win 1-0. If it’s that one, we’ll draw, if it’s that one over there, we’ll lose. And if it’s this one, we’ll win on penalties’. There are no prizes for guessing which one finally arrived. It was a night of ups and downs, so a story about lifts feels appropriate</p>

  <p><b>[Benitez reveals what he told <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players at half-time of 2005 Champions League final]</b> When you concede a second goal, you have to think about changing something. And if you concede a third? Well, then you definitely have to change and that was very clear. I said to Pako Ayestaran, my assistant, ‘I will give the half-time team talk and we will talk about three at the back to have an extra player in the middle. You go and do the warm-up with Hamann’. The message we gave to the players was about confidence - try to score early, get back in the game. That was the main thing. In other circumstances or with smaller teams, perhaps you might be looking at damage limitation because you don’t want to concede four or five goals but this was a final. You have to go for it. And then, depending on what happens in the first few minutes, you make decisions. Again, we did it</p>
