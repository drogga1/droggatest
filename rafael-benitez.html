  <dd><a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and the owners fall out over the Spaniard’s transfer targets for January 2008. Gillett and Hicks reportedly tell <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> to ‘concentrate on training and coaching the players he already has’. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> responds with a frosty press conference in which he repeats that phrase in answer to every question. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s form, impressive in the early weeks of the season, begins to deteriorate.</dd>
  <dt>2008 01 14</dt>
  <dd>Hicks admits the club had made an approach to former Germany manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Juergen Klinsmann</a>, with a view to <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> replacing <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> as manager.

Hicks says, however, that such a move was ‘an insurance policy, to have him become manager if Rafa left for Real Madrid’.</dd>

  <dd>It emerges that Gillett and Hicks are barely on speaking terms, throwing the club into turmoil. <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>, it transpires, was present when Gillett and Hicks met with <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> the previous November, further souring his relationship with <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>. Days later, Hicks rounds on <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a>, accusing the chief executive of failing in his commercial and professional duties, and advising the termination of his contract. <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a> would leave his role at the end of the following season.</dd>

Amazing effort. They are dangerous, but the teamwork we showed to fight for every ball was amazing. I am pleased for the players and the fans. Because we won here at home. We had games in past when we conceded late. We got lucky with some shots, but we showed the character, the commitment and the desire today<br /><br /><b>[On Jonjo Shelvey]</b> Jonjo showed quality on the ball.

If the owner can be on the pitch and score a couple of goals it would be better!<br /><br />We are missing this kind of situation when we have a couple of chances, we have to do a little better. If you score, then the game changes totally<br /><br /><b>[The afternoon was marred when Palace right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka was struck by a bottle thrown from the Newcastle section of the crowd]</b> We had 3,000 fans and they were fantastic, maybe one made a mistake</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez is unaware of any prospective takeover led by former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon]</b> I have not spoken to Mike Ashley today, but if he is around it is positive. We have to concentrate on things on the pitch. I don’t know anything about a takeover, I just concentrate on the pitch.<br /><br />Obviously I am disappointed, we conceded two goals from set-pieces and didn’t take our chances. The second goal killed us mentally. Leicester were well organised and worked hard and they have some good players. When you concede it is always difficult for you. When things are not going in your favour you concede penalties like that. We have to manage the squad, we tried to be more offensive but we didn’t take our chances and we were exposed in the second half. The team is working hard, you cannot complain about that</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle will look outside of England for transfer options this January]</b> As far as the transfer window, with the budget and all these things, the first thing is to find the right players because you cannot bring players from the Premier League on loan as we have two players already. We have to see abroad and see where we can maybe buy players from. Instead of doing that, you have to look for the players that you want - and then analyse who we can, or cannot, sign. At the moment it is too early, but we are working on names and players. Still though we do not have ‘this one’ that we are going for him because it is a little too early.<br /><br />We try to see everywhere if we can. Apart from England - although we are also watching England - we are looking for options everywhere. We have to see everywhere because we have to consider who we can buy or loan or whatever. It’s just to bring the players that, in your opinion, will be better for your squad and give you something different. Martin was an example from the Czech league, but we are watching every league; not just in Europe, either, we are watching America and all over. We are watching everything. America, South America, Asia - everything. We have a player from Japan, another from South Korea, so we know we can find players from everywhere. The teams at the top of the table in different leagues, it is very rare that the player will come here. It has to be someone that maybe you know, or know their agent, or you have some connection in some way. But it’s quite difficult, so you have to see every league around the world, see the options, and then the first thing is: ‘OK, this is the player. Can we buy them? Can it be a loan?’ All these questions, but first we must find the players</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Benitez claims his Newcastle side need a miracle to avoid being dragged into a Premier League relegation battle]</b> We have to be realistic and understand that we will be in the bottom half during the whole season. For me, it is almost clear and if we can be better than three teams, it will be another miracle. It was a miracle last year. People were thinking, ‘Oh, you finished 10th…’, but with a couple fewer wins, we could have been in the bottom five, so it was a miracle. If we do the same this year with teams spending even more money than last year, it will be a miracle.<br /><br />I know what is coming now and I know where we are. You can see the team - the team is trying a lot of things, but still it’s not enough sometimes to get the points, and it will be like that. If we are under pressure and we feel this pressure, we will not be better, we can make more mistakes. I’m trying to tell everyone, realise where we are, realise what we have to do and if we do well, fine, we can finish 10th or whatever. But if we think we have to beat these teams which have spent £100 million, every one of them, during the summer, if we think we can beat them easily every game, no chance.

Football is about consistency and quality and, at the moment, he has everything.<br /><br />When I was there we had to sell to buy. Now, I think they have a better squad because when you spend money you bring in better players.

  <p><b>[Benitez has finally broken his silence following his exit, insisting that creative differences between himself and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> board led to his final decision]</b> Thank you to everyone at the Club who has helped the team and of course to the fine players who grew and fought with us and to the staff (one of the best I have ever shared time with). From winning the Championship to our two seasons in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, fans, staff and players have all been United. I wanted to stay, but I didn’t just want to sign an extended contract, I wanted to be part of a project. Unfortunately, it became increasingly clear to me that those at the top of the Club did not share the same vision. I’m very sad about that, but I do not regret for one moment my decision to come to Tyneside and I’m very proud of what we achieved together. I will always have you in my heart. Best of luck for the future. C’mon Toons!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a> Benitez has lifted the lid on his acrimonious departure from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>]</b> ple in <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> have been talking about my decision to move to China without knowing what happened behind the scenes during my three years at <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a>. I haven’t wanted to say too much about that - I’ve encouraged supporters to get behind <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a> and his new team - but I’ve been made aware of what Lee Charnley, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s managing director, claimed in the club’s match programme last weekend and I think it’s important I address that. Hopefully, it will be the last time I have to do so. In the future I want to write about football and nothing but football.<br /><br />When I joined <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> in 2016, I did it with all my heart. I could feel the history and see the potential of the club and I wanted to be part of a project and to stay close to my family on Merseyside. I tried to do my best every day, even staying when we went down to the Championship and saying no to other offers - bigger offers than the one I recently accepted with <a href="dalian-yifang.html">Dalian Yifang</a>, by the way. If I was only interested in moving ‘for money’, as Charnley stated, I could have done it much earlier. Over my long career, and especially in my time at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, I’ve always shown commitment to my club, its city and its community and I’ve done it with professionalism and honesty. I want to remember the good moments I spent in the north east - and there were many of them - and not have to keep denying things about my time there or about my departure.<br /><br /><a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s board had a year to sort out my contract but, when we met after the end of last season, they didn’t make me an offer I could accept. They told me they didn’t want to invest in the academy or the training ground - if they like, I can explain the reason why <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> refused to do that. Their idea of a project was a policy of signing players under 24 and, in my opinion, the budget available was not enough to compete for the top 10. After that meeting, I knew they would not come back with a serious offer and, when it arrived, 19 days later, it was for the same salary as three years earlier and with less control over signings. Charnley’s comments in the programme about having a deal agreed for Joelinton in February explains a lot that I couldn’t understand at that time. After three years of unfulfilled promises, I didn’t trust them.<br /><br />When we finished 10th in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in our first season back, all players and staff were paid a bonus - aside from my coaching team. That felt like a punishment for me not signing an extension. So, by the end, I knew there would not be a proper offer and they knew I was not signing. I couldn’t explain that in public because I was not allowed to talk to the press without their permission, so I was waiting until late June, like every fan, hoping there would be good news about <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s prospective takeover. The time was passing and we were losing job opportunities in Europe. I couldn’t wait forever. I’m a family man and I have a responsibility to them, my staff, Paco Francisco de Míguel Moreno, Antonio Gomez and Mikel Antia, and their families, too. I don’t like to gamble with the future of my people. In front of us we had three options: nothing serious from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, the hope of a possible takeover or a different project. Yes, it was a big offer in China - I have never denied that - but it was also another continent and another league, from a club giving us a lot of recognition and respect. That decision wasn’t easy, but it was clear</p>

As soon as they attack you, if they give the ball away they are pressing you so it is very difficult to counter-attack and create something.

I said to Pako Ayestaran, my assistant, ‘I will give the half-time team talk and we will talk about three at the back to have an extra player in the middle. You go and do the warm-up with Hamann’. The message we gave to the players was about confidence - try to score early, get back in the game. That was the main thing. In other circumstances or with smaller teams, perhaps you might be looking at damage limitation because you don’t want to concede four or five goals but this was a final. You have to go for it. And then, depending on what happens in the first few minutes, you make decisions. Again, we did it</p>

  <p><b>[Benitez: Dalian Pro have discussed Carrasco-Lozano swap deal with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> We stayed in touch and when we talk to each other we feel mutual respect. At the time, as is inevitable, there were differences, but nothing sensational or disrespectful. We had the opportunity to chat in January, it seems to me, because an exchange could be made involving <a href="hirving-lozano.html">Lozano</a> and Carrasco</p>
