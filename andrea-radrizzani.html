  <p><b>[Leeds United have confirmed the appointment of former Argentina and Marseille boss Marcelo Bielsa as their new manager on a two-year contract]</b> I am thrilled to welcome Marcelo and his staff to Leeds United. He is a coach that I have admired for many years and when the opportunity arose to bring him to Elland Road, we made it our top priority for the summer. Marcelo has a wealth of experience and he will use that to create a new culture and a winning mentality at our football club. I would like to thank Victor Orta and Angus Kinnear for all of the hard work that has gone into this appointment and I look forward to progressing together.</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani has revealed that he wanted to appoint Antonio Conte as the club’s new manager before settling on Marcelo Bielsa]</b> Conte <b>[was on the list]</b> and with him, we would have been certain of promotion to the Premier League. I would even have offered him €20m. Then I interviewed Ranieri who was attracted by our interest, but declined as he was waiting for a call from a top-flight club. I even spoke to Martinez, but Belgium were an obstacle. At the end of May, I spoke with our director of football <b>[Victor]</b> Orta and he said Bielsa would be ideal, but that it would be impossible <b>[to get him]</b>. Those words just motivated me even more and we negotiated for a few days then reached an agreement at £3m, which he shares with his staff, and a one year plus one year option as duration. We finished negotiations after ten hours of conversation in Buenos Aires. He’d studied 20 of our games and already knew all the players, including the youngsters. It seemed impossible to get him here, but he’s our top player. We are a Premier League club, and even more so with him.</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani has called on Championship clubs to reconsider the idea of Premier League 2]</b> I think we should consider that a club like Leeds is watched by 500,000 or 600,000 people live on Sky and still getting only from the league only £2.5m <b>[per year in broadcast revenue]</b>. Being on TV more than 20 times means that we should reconsider the entire system because we lose money creating a show that is of high interest to everyone. I think the other chairman would love to open a discussion, I think the time is getting close to consider how to move forward. To not have a crisis every two years with clubs going bankrupt or changing ownership every other year. We have not had the meeting yet. It is my idea but you should ask the other clubs. I am sure many chairman would agree<br /><br /><b>[On Marcelo Bielsa]</b> I think everything <b>[has improved]</b> The club has progressed in terms of management and facilities. This year also the sports side is doing better, the whole combination gives me the impression that the club is catching up to be a modern club, to be soon ready. If not this year then the next one, to be ready to go into the right direction for promotion. That’s what I wanted after last year I really wanted a manager with a strong leader and be a catalyst for the entire club. Not only to change the players, I thought we needed to change the entire culture of the club and quickly he has already achieved that objective, so I am happy about that. Let’s keep going and see where we are in a few months. Of course <b>[we can get into the Premier League]</b>, if not he would never have come to Leeds. We will see<br /><br />As far as we know, I am ready to have a friendly and open conversation about this point,” He concluded. “To consider penalising us <b>[is wrong]</b> because there are already betting showing these games live. Why, when we legitimately paid for the rights, can we not show it? Also there are many other illegal sites and pirates that we should fight against. I am open to talk to find a friendly solution but we will carry on. Uefa haven’t contacted us to tell us to stop. We have the support of La Liga to do this. To do it with Serie A, we will have to discuss it with them. Also I would like to see why if this is competing with ticket sales in UK stadiums, why they are not worried about Tour de France and other sports when they are shown <b>[at the same time]</b> on live TV? I am not against the blackout, particularly for domestic events but I don’t think that people will fly to Italy or Spain and damage the ticket sales in the UK</p>

  <p><b>[How <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> owner, Andrea Radrizzani, described the indefinite postponement of the season]</b> A disaster unfortunately. To be competitive, a club like ours loses £8 million ($10m) to £10m ($12.5m) every year and nobody wants to keep a business that loses money every year. This situation aggravates the budget. Not having five home games, we will lose about £2.5m, which are the only source of revenues since such figures do not come from TV rights. This epidemic aggravates this situation, which is already normally complicated.<br /><br />I think the model of the Championship should be reconsidered because the turnover of owners keeps changing all the time every one, two, three years. It is not really a healthy system for the fans, for the clubs - this is because it is really not sustainable to stay in the Championship. There is a huge gap with the clubs coming down relegated from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, they have parachute <b>[payments]</b>, they have a bigger TV budget. This model and also the small money they <b>[the EFL]</b> generate from TV rights, split between 72 clubs, maybe they need to reconsider and consider another way to create a ‘Premier League 2’ or something else, that can be sustainable, even for those who are not promoted</p>

  <p><b>[The club’s owner Andrea Radrizzani said of the decision to rename the south stand]</b> Naming the south stand after Norman is the very least we could do to recognise the lifetime of hard work and dedication he gave to our football club. Norman was respected and loved by everyone connected to the club and as we battle through uncertain times it is unlikely that he will be able to be given the send-off he deserves and therefore we expect the South Stand to be bouncing when fans are finally allowed to return to <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a> and pay their respects to a giant of the game.</p>
