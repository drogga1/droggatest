We are delighted to be able to share a unique, behind-the-scenes perspective on the ups and downs, the emotion and the intimate moments that make this club so special</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> owner Andrea Radrizzani has admitted that he would be open to accepting investment from the Qatari owners of <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> These are rumours that have been ongoing for more than a year now. What is true is that we have a great relationship on a personal level, there’s a desire to do something together maybe even in football but there’s nothing concrete at this time.<br /><br />In the last few weeks everything took a back seat. My desire to have a great <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> that is a protagonist in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and to do so we will need partners on top of the San Francisco 49ers, we’ll evaluate this when we are in that league<br /><br />I have been approached by more than 20 parties and I have selected these three.

  <p><b>[How <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> owner, Andrea Radrizzani, described the indefinite postponement of the season]</b> A disaster unfortunately. To be competitive, a club like ours loses £8 million ($10m) to £10m ($12.5m) every year and nobody wants to keep a business that loses money every year. This situation aggravates the budget. Not having five home games, we will lose about £2.5m, which are the only source of revenues since such figures do not come from TV rights. This epidemic aggravates this situation, which is already normally complicated.<br /><br />I think the model of the Championship should be reconsidered because the turnover of owners keeps changing all the time every one, two, three years. It is not really a healthy system for the fans, for the clubs - this is because it is really not sustainable to stay in the Championship. There is a huge gap with the clubs coming down relegated from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, they have parachute <b>[payments]</b>, they have a bigger TV budget. This model and also the small money they <b>[the EFL]</b> generate from TV rights, split between 72 clubs, maybe they need to reconsider and consider another way to create a ‘Premier League 2’ or something else, that can be sustainable, even for those who are not promoted</p>

  <p><b>[The club’s owner Andrea Radrizzani said of the decision to rename the south stand]</b> Naming the south stand after Norman is the very least we could do to recognise the lifetime of hard work and dedication he gave to our football club. Norman was respected and loved by everyone connected to the club and as we battle through uncertain times it is unlikely that he will be able to be given the send-off he deserves and therefore we expect the South Stand to be bouncing when fans are finally allowed to return to <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a> and pay their respects to a giant of the game.</p>
