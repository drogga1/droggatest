  <p><b>[Spain assistant Robert Moreno said he has remained in constant communication with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> and insisted the absent head coach is still in charge of the team]</b> I have been in contact with Luis all week as we prepared for this game. I spoke to him before the game about the line-up for today and we discussed tactics for the threat of the Faroe Islands. We maintained contact throughout the game, and we have a courier delivering messages to him at full-time. I am here for as long as I am needed, but Luis remains manager of the team.<br /><br /><b>[Moreno revealed the support for <a href="santi-cazorla.html">Santi Cazorla</a> is so widespread in the team that even the head coach sent a message of support for the midfielder]</b> We are very happy with the return of Santi. Even Luis has sent us a message congratulating him. We know of his quality, what he has done today is of incredible merit</p>

But Kepa had an incredible end of the season - champion of the Europa League with great performances. In this concrete moment, we thought that Kepa could help us in a better way. The competition is now on. When you have something easy, you get relaxed, and that’s not good. The competitiveness is also good in goal.<br /><br />It’s not just about one single thing. We already watched Kepa play quite well in the Europa League, so you could already guess he was in good shape. But we had to check it in the team. I talked to <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> on Friday, right before the game, and we chatted about it. And after the game, we decided to keep him in the lineup. It’s not one concrete moment when we decided it, but we started commenting the lineup a long time ago, and then when you have all the info on your hands, that’s what gives you the last push to take the decision</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Moreno is hopeful Monday’s 3-0 win over Sweden is the last game he will be required to fill in for the absent Spain coach <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>]</b> What I want most is for this to be the last time I have to be on the touchline.<br /><br />We do not see a lot of foreign football in Spain. If you see the season finale, he had options to start. We also have Pau Lopez, three goalkeepers who give us what we want. <b>[Kepa is in a]</b> sweet moment. In life you need a good time and Kepa comes from that, from being a Europa League champion. Of course, we are in search of a fixed group, but it would not be good to have one <b>[starting]</b> team. You need more than 11 players. There are injuries that can happen, generating competition enriches the group.<br /><br />In the end you have to make decisions, but we always do everything with the best in mind for the team and for Spain. I do not know when the change of Kepa was decided. I spoke with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> about this on Friday, and it was decided to keep the goalkeeper. A couple of weeks ago we started thinking about it, then we saw the training, and with all the data we made the decision to keep Kepa.</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Moreno says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> superstar <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> makes football look like the Matrix]</b> Leo is the greatest of all time. I didn’t see <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> or <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> play live, but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is incredible just in the training sessions. The perfect professional. Some believe it’s just a natural gift but he’s one of the first to arrive at training, who looks after what he eats. Being the greatest for so long and with so many titles, he deserves even more credit. In terms of interpreting his style of play, with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> we made a comparison and that was comparing him to the Matrix. It’s like the scene stops, everything is in slow motion, and he passes the ball. Leo sees things that way on the pitch. He analyses and looks at what is happening. He searches for space to receive the ball and get involved. With every passing year, he gets even better because he understands the game so well.<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> boss <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> has suggested that an all-time great is not a team player. Moreno is not buying that, adding on the assessment of an outspoken Dutchman]</b> It’s tough because I admire Van Gaal for what he’s done but I also admire <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> a lot. Van Gaal focuses on the collective idea but if you try to force pieces to put your system it’s a mistake. You need to look at what’s available to you and create a collective system. We, with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>, thought that the rest of the players should adapt to what disruption Leo generates out on the pitch. He could move into areas where no one else could but the team must be prepared to defend should he lose possession. With one person it’s easy to coordinate things. With five, less so, which is what Van Gaal was referring to</p>

  <p><b>[Spain coach Robert Moreno is hoping for great things from Pablo Sarabia, who swapped <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> for <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in July]</b> I think that Sarabia is a player that, having seen him in the position where he performed at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, can add many things because he is a forward with the spirit of a midfielder. He can create between the lines and make assists. He also scores goals. When you don’t have a forward that scores 80 goals you need five that score 15 goals each. That is what we look for from our forwards, not only to add to the game but to score goals. That is the ideal scenario. Pablo did great in <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> last year. He is also performing well in <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. He has the profile that we like for the style of game that we will try to impose.

I will not say if one is my preferred goalkeeper or not<br /><br />We must be honest and say that every team deserves respect. Thinking of scoring six goals is not football.

Without guys like him and Raul and Sergio it’s hard to win tournament semi-finals and finals. The contribution of people like Santi, Sergio and Raul - the generation who have already won tournaments - is incalculable. They have such quality and it’s hard to win tournaments without their kind of experience. They’ve accumulated things that they not only contribute in performance but transmit to others<br /><br />The gap between ‘big’ international sides and so-called lesser nations is closing - it’s very equal now across the board. We worked really hard on opening things up, on finishing, because we knew we wouldn’t have it easy. Playing well like this and scoring lots of goals is always very welcome. The easiest thing in the world would have been for my players to accept three or four-nil and drop their level. But we hit seven and could easily have scored 10 - that says very good things about their mentality. I note that the players are remembering what I told them the last time we were together and the time before that. We are apart for weeks or months but the momentum is growing so that they put into practice what I asked of them previously. That’s good. We think it’s pretty historic that both Pau Torres and <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> both came on and scored with their first touch.

Romania are not playing for anything as they have secured a place in the play-offs, so that will make them a more dangerous opponent. I would like Cosmin Contra to continue coaching Romania. He is doing a good job. I think he is a good coach. If he wants to keep coaching Romania I think it will be good for the country</p>

  <p><b>[No easy way for Spain to move on from Robert Moreno and re-appoint <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>]</b> They’ve thrown me away, they’ve thrown me away <b>[…]</b> I consider Luis a friend and friendship comes before anything else in life because without it, I think you lose what it means to be a person. So if the time comes when he decides that he wants to come back and be coach, whenever that might be, and he wants to be involved with us, then I would be the first and most delighted to step aside and go back to working with him<br /><br />I don’t need to sit down with <a href="luis-rubiales.html">Rubiales</a> or <a href="jorge-molina.html">Molina</a>.

  <p><b>[Robert Moreno insists he has a clear conscience after his stint as Spain head coach ended with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>’s return to the role]</b> I have a clear conscience. It is impossible to please everyone, but I sincerely tell you that I respect all and all opinions. I have always maintained that I am a man of my word and would not be an obstacle in the event that <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> decided to return. I have done so even though it has meant my departure. I wish him well because his joys will be ours<br /><br /><b>[Referring to the extreme situation in <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>’s personal life that led to him taking charge, Moreno said he wished he had never been required to become coach]</b> My experience as an absolute coach began and ended in the same way, with a bittersweet feeling. I have to look forward and face new challenges as a coach in my passion, football. I am prepared to face the challenge of leading new projects</p>

  <p><b>[Former Spain coach Robert Moreno has insisted <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>’s ugly claims that he was disloyal and ambitious are unfair]</b> I don’t want to go into reproaches, but I have been personally attacked and labelled with something that I am not. In this puzzle, my pieces are missing. Nine years ago, I started working with <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a>. We have always followed him, being faithful, until he reached the national team<br /><br />Nobody knew for how long he would be out, but what we all did know was, if there was a possibility for him to return to the national team, our staff would have to stay. So, I stepped up and took charge of the team. If I had not done so, now <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> would not be coach of the national team. It would be another coach<br /><br /><b>[Moreno said he was left in a state of shock for a week after learning <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> did not intend to make him assistant again]</b> To this date, I honestly don’t know why <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> doesn’t want me to be with him. I don’t know as he was not clear in his news conference. He labelled me with two adjectives <b>[disloyal and ambitious]</b> that are very ugly and that I don’t deserve. I have proved over the whole time I worked with him that I am not like that. The years will pass and I will still not know. He could not explain it - or I could not understand it according to what my people have told me, as I did not watch the news conference myself<br /><br /><b>[Preferring to look forward, Moreno reiterated his desire to continue a career as a head coach]</b> I have just started. I am really excited to be back on the pitch, to handle training sessions, to manage a team, to make decisions, to attend news conferences. I’m really looking forward to it. It has always been my passion to become a head coach. I am someone who started from the very bottom but was able to reach the top level</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> boss Robert Moreno keen to move on from <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> spat]</b> I spent nine wonderful years at his side. I only have thanks. What happened a few weeks ago is already in the past. I have been a coach for 28 years. Since I was 14, I have been training and now the important thing is this presentation. The past is there, but you have to leave it behind<br /><br /><b>[Moreno has never previously managed a professional club but insists he is aware of what it requires to be successful]</b> I have always been involved in the whole training process. I used to do all that before, so my processes will not change. I will give the talks, analyse the opposition, talk to my players. I am used to this. We all want to win and to achieve the best for the club. Our main objective here must be to improve every day. If we do that we will be able to reach our main aims<br /><br /><b>[<a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> have been tipped to bolster their squad ahead in the January transfer window]</b> I will not make it public - that would be disrespectful to my players. <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> have a large squad but we have to be attentive to the market to find good players.

He is not fit for training. As I said on Monday, as long as the transfer window is open, there is the possibility for each player to leave. We have to be prepared for that.</p>
