> [Lobi Stars coach, Solomon Ogbeide has explained that the Nigerian Coaches Association will continue to defend embattled Salisu Yusuf] What I have to say about it is that it has not been confirmed that Salisu Yusuf erred. We can’t try him in the media and from the available information at our disposal, I don’t think he has done anything wrong. We are behind him until there is a proper investigation that will confirm our doubts. He was not the one that asked for the cash that was given him and we heard from the footage of the video clip where he said players are selected on merit. We will not leave him at this point in time until it is proven that he committed the wrongdoing.
