<blockquote>
  <p>[Philippe Coutinho made the right decision in leaving Liverpool for Barcelona] Yes, he came from a very big club like Liverpool and went to probably the best club in the world right now. Not everyone has that opportunity. If we talk about performance, we have to be clear that he is a player that can always be selected. In the end, if they demand more, it is because they know that he can give it. They have a lot of quality and he can do better despite being a very important player. He is the first one that wants to play, one hundred per cent.<br /><br />It’s hard to say, but if Barcelona are able to apply their game then they they will get it right. A 2-0, or maybe a 3-1 would be a good result but I do not see many goals in the first leg. I do not think they’re going to go crazy. We’ll see a quicker game in Liverpool, and at Anfield I do expect more goals. There may be a draw there with more goals and finally Barcelona will go through<br /><br />All the coaches have tried it. He’s an incredible individual but I think it’s a mistake to look only at him. Barcelona has the ability to move the ball very quickly and find the free man. It will not always be Messi, but he has the ability to make things happen around him. Everyone will have to pay attention to their defensive duties, but I have no doubt that Liverpool will look to close off the space down the middle. I think the key will be the pace of the game. If Liverpool are not comfortable, Barcelona will have a lot of chances to win</p>
