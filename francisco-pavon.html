  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo should renew his contract every year]</b> Ronaldo should renew his contract every year if we look at his performances. There’s no doubt at all. A different matter is whether the plans of the club and player fit together. Is it fair Cristiano and Messi have the same number of Ballons d’Or? The one who wins the Ballon d’Or gets it because he deserves it.<br /><br />Luka Modric and Andres Iniesta are Ballon d’Or winners without the trophy. It’s not fair a player like Modric hasn’t won the Ballon d’Or, but the incredible amount of goals of the other two football monsters hides his football<br /><br />At the beginning of the season, Real Madrid didn’t score goals. They weren’t bad at all, but there weren’t the goals. Now they have improved the defensive line as well. They are going through a great period ahead the Clasico. And so are Barcelona. At the beginning, they won many games playing just so-so, but taking the points. That’s the main difference in the table right now<br /><br />This is the best squad since the 90s. Not only for the five titles, but especially for the two consecutive Champions League wins. Who is better out of this team and the Galacticos after winning five titles in 2017? They are different. Even the games are different. In the game nowadays there is much more possession, whereas before individual performances were more important. Those players were incredibly talented. Surely Cristiano and Messi are at that same level. But it’s difficult to compare both teams and both stages as football now is much more about the collective</p>

  <p><b>[How are Real Madrid fourth?! How La Liga kings became Christmas turkeys]</b> At the beginning of the season, Real Madrid couldn’t score goals. They weren’t bad at all, but there weren’t goals. Now they have improved the defensive line too. They are living a great moment ahead of the Clasico. And Barcelona too; in the beginning, they won many games playing only so so but taking the points. That’s the main difference in the table right now.<br /><br />This is the best squad since the 90s. Not only for the five titles, but especially for the two consecutive Champions Leagues. Which is the better team, the Galacticos or this one after winning five titles in 2017? It’s different. Even the games are different. In the games nowadays there’s much more possession. In those days the individual performances were more important. Those players were incredibly talented. Surely Cristiano and Messi are at that same level. But it’s different to compare both teams and both stages as football now is much more collective</p>

  <p><b>[On Marceloa]</b> He arrived with his grandpa and he was such a nice kid. I spent a year-and-a-half with him. His family gave him a great education from when he was very young and he was so shy at the beginning. It wasn’t easy for him because he arrived at Real Madrid in order to become the heir to Roberto Carlos and he wanted to play all games. Marcelo didn’t get a lot of playing time but look what he has become. I am so happy for him because he deserves it.<br /><br /><b>[On Roberto Carlos and Marcelo]</b> I played with both. Both are very different even if both are offensive left-backs, but each has his own skills. In their own way, I think they have been the best left-backs ever to play for Real Madrid<br /><br />Both <b>[Marcelo and Carvajal]</b> are fundamental, especially in attack. Both bring superiority when attacking because they go forward often and create two-versus-one situations. A lot of goals this season have come after long runs from one of them ended with a Cristiano or a <b>[Karim]</b> Benzema shot</p>
