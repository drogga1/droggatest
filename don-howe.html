  <p><b>[former <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> coach Don Howe on being England manager]</b> I have heard the England manager’s job described as the toughest job in football and, while that maybe true, I can say with some assurance that it is worth the strain because it is also the best job in the business. Yes it is true that the pressure is intense because the weight of a nation’s expectations is on your shoulders during tournaments and that is quite a burden. But you have got to remember that this is the chance to work with the 23 best players that your country has to offer and when you look at it that way you see that the pros easily outweigh the cons</p>

  <p><b>[on Ron <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> and <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a>]</b> I had the privilege of working as the assistant to the late Ron <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> and the late <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a> as well as <a href="terry-venables.html">Terry Venables</a> when they were in charge of the national side. It was a joy to serve my country alongside them and with that experience in mind I can say with confidence that <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> is the ideal man to be the next England manager. That has got nothing to do with the fact that I am an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man and I just want to see <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> knocked off course, it is because I feel he has the experience and the know-how to make a good fist of the job at Euro 2012. That’s because like Ron, Bobby and Terry, he is an extremely likeable chap and he is the sort of person that the players will listen to and respect when they are together. Plus, the way that he has got <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> playing - with that pass-and-move/give-and-go system - is so easy to understand and any England player will buy into that. But, like Ron, Bobby and Terry, Harry has been around the block a few times and he will feel comfortable in dealing with the biggest stars of the English game and making tough decisions - like dropping or leaving out players who have never been dropped in their lives. That is a vital part of the role. It is easier said than done but I don’t think he will shirk from that side of things. It requires strength of character and conviction to do that. It requires strong leadership.</p>

  <p><b>[on Media attention]</b> Media attention has grown massively since I became part of the England coaching set-up but that is understandable because the pubic are fascinated by the national team. I have seen that you have to be able to handle yourself well with the media and Harry ticks all the boxes in that respect. After what he has gone through in court it will be a walk in the park. The media side of things can be a distraction if you are not careful and you have to be ready to take the rough with the smooth because reaction can be over the top at times when things do not go well. It can get personal. I have seen happen before and it will happen again. Bobby was slaughtered by some journalists but he retained his dignity and almost got us to a World Cup final.</p>

  <p><b>[on job as English manager]</b> It is a strange job in certain ways because weeks and weeks of relative inactivity suddenly give way to an intense period of activity. You go from watching matches on a regular basis, scouting and scrutinising opponents and keeping in touch with clubs and coaches and managers to suddenly being thrust onto centre-stage and you have to be ready for action. It also helps if you are a diplomat to make sure that the all-powerful clubs are on your side as well and players are not pulled out. There is not a minute to be wasted when you are working with your players. You don’t get them for very long so everything has to be in place to make the most of your time together. They all have different ways of doing things at their clubs and it is the manager’s job to get them to do things his way on the practice ground, at the team hotel and out on the pitch when the games start. The manager has to delegate to his coaches but also be ready to step in at the right time to remind everyone who is the boss. He has to say the right thing at the right time.</p>

  <p><b>[on all English Captain]</b> There is a need for discipline and that needs to be spelled out but the England manager needs to be approachable as well so there is time for the one-on-ones as well as team meetings. Terry was exceptional when it came to motivating players. You just have to look at what he did with <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> ahead of Euro 96. Alan was going through a lean spell with England but Terry never lost faith and I will always remember him strolling around the pitch with him while practice games were going on. Somehow I couldn’t imagine <a href="fabio-capello.html">Fabio Capello</a> doing that but that is the sort of motivational device that could be vital to making sure the players are in the right frame of mind. Besides that all you need is a bit of luck and people might stop calling it the toughest job in football</p>
