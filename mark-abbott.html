  <p><b>[Regulations laid down by <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> mean that teams are not allowed to charter flights for any more than four legs of journeys over the season. This means that there are effectively two matches they can travel privately for, as the inbound and outbound flights each count as one leg - a paltry number given the travelling commitments for teams over a season that will stretch to at least 34 matches]</b> Look at what we have done with our schedule so that when people travel across the country we try and have them play more than one game so that the travel is minimised as a result of that. You now play more games against your regional rivals or clubs in your conference which also minimises travel.<br /><br /><b>[From the League’s perspective, though, there is a trade-off between the expense of flights and wages it can afford to pay its players]</b> The question is what’s the right balance between investment in player compensation and investment in charter travel?</p>
