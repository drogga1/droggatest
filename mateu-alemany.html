  <p><b>[Mateu Alemany made clear at the end of May that Denis Suarez was among his club’s transfer targets]</b> Our obligation is to be in the market, that list can be very long and Denis Suarez would be one of them</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia general director Mateu Alemany has revealed <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s offer for Rodrigo is no longer on the table ahead of the new La Liga campaign]</b> There was the possibility that Rodrigo could be transferred, (but) right now, there is no offer on the table. Those who were offering are now no longer offering, and what seemed like an agreement could not be executed. He is available to train and, at his request, play on Saturday against Real Sociedad<br /><br /><b>[Both Everton and Napoli were credited with an interest in the player this summer, but Atleti appeared to have won the race for his signature before Alemany’s revelation]</b> There was a principle of agreement. Subsequently, due to circumstances that have nothing to do with Valencia, it did not go ahead. The situation, which at that time had to be specified, was between Atleti and Rodrigo. They had spoken and the decision, I think, was not yet taken by Rodrigo. I have seen him today and he’s very happy. Between clubs, there was a principle agreement, and right now that offer is no longer on the table<br /><br /><b>[When asked why the player had not trained alongside his teammates earlier this week]</b> When a soccer player understands that his departure is near, it is usual for everything to stop. The situation is normal. Everything that was said has not materialised in a concrete offer. Rodrigo spoke with (Valencia head coach) Marcelino and me yesterday afternoon, and wanted to join the team</p>
