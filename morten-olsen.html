<blockquote>
  <p>[Morten Olsen has announced his resignation as the head coach of Denmark following 15 years in charge of the national team] I have informed the DBU and the players that I will stop now. It makes no sense for me to continue, it must be a new coach. I am especially disappointed for the players that they do not get the experience of getting to the finals, so it does of course hurt me personally. But I think we have an exciting squad. We have many young players, but also older and more experienced ones.</p>

  <p>[Christian Eriksen is ready for a move to either Barcelona or Real Madrid] I think that he was in a very good school, at Ajax. But, the most important thing for the players is to play matches. And I think he chose very well by signing for Tottenham. They are always a club which plays good football. He is growing, and he is also better in the national team because every Sunday he is used to playing against the best and top players. When you learn from mistakes you’re growing. And he is a fantastic human being, very ambitious. He is already a top player, and he is ready for a team like Barcelona or Real Madrid. And, for the Danish national team, he is very important.<br /><br />[On Andreas Christiansen] He will be surely a top player. He is in a situation where he can play a lot of big games, in the Premier League and Champions League. And these are good tests and he can only get better</p>
