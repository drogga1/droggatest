  <p><b>[Quote on Ruud Gullit]</b> <b>[. . .]</b> <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Gullit</a> was a legend. He was more powerful than Van Basten, so it was almost impossible to get the ball from him. But he had a different style, and was Van Basten’s perfect partner: every coach’s dream is to have a technical player partnered with a physical one</p>

  <p><b>[Gheorghe Hagi says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have changed football forever]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has always had an amazing team behind him. I think that was his luck, to be in a team with 20 extraordinary players. They changed football forever. There were so pragmatic, so simple, going from simple to complicated with a lot of technique. Because what matters is the mind, the talent and the skills of the player, because you have to choose players with talent<br /><br />I learned a lot of him. When he called me at the <b>[1994]</b> World Cup, <b>[to tell me]</b> that he wanted me in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it was a happy day for me. I knew if I went there I would learn a lot from <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> too with the concept. So it was an honour for me to be coached, to learn, to see the hero of my childhood, to be near him, to see how he thinks, to see how he acts if you do something wrong - and that happened two or three times because I made mistakes. I learned a lot from him. All his thoughts about football, how he thought, how he created, how he trained, that was fundamental. I say that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> changed my mind.</p>

  <p><b>[Gheorghe Hagi speaks about winning the Romanian league as manager of Viitorul Constanta and his passion for youth development for club and country]</b> I took a lot of risks but I did it because of the immense passion I have for football. If my academy has become an example for others then that’s a very good thing. I had a great career as a player and I’m very happy with what I achieved but this is the second part. My mission now is to help others achieve their dreams, in football and in life</p>

  <p><b>[Future Ballon d’Or contender? Ianis Hagi making a name for himself at Under-21 Euros]</b> I am sure that Ianis will have a great career. He’s an ideal No.10. I hope that he can become better than I was.<br /><br /><b>[Ianis, though, barely got a chance to show what he could do, afforded just two Serie A appearances in 18 months at the Stadio Artemio Franchi]</b> The sporting director <b>[Pantaleo Corvino]</b> does everything. It’s worse than in Romania than during the dictatorship of the general <b>[Nicolae Ceausescu, between 1967 and 1989]</b>. I have produced as many players as he boasts about. Fiorentina has a budget of €100 million and they’re in 11th place with <b>[former coach]</b> Stefano Poli. In Florence, everyone was curious to see Ianis play. He did great things with the Primavera but they didn’t let him grow. Fiorentina has lost a great player that one day will be able to compete for the Ballon d’Or.</p>

  <p><b>[Gheorghe Hagi says Real Madrid would be among the favourites for this season’s Champions League if they signed Neymar]</b> They can win easier. Without a doubt. If they sign Neymar and with the Eden Hazard signing, they can win the Champions League again. <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane will then have to find a place for each one, but it’s the best thing that can happen to a coach. You just have to motivate them<br /><br /><b>[Neymar has struggled to hit the heights of his time at Barca following his move to France]</b> There are times that he is good and sometimes he is not. The value of the player is the same. He is a player who would do well for all the teams in the world<br /><br /><b>[Hagi was also drawn on the age-old debate of whether he prefers Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I would love to be his coach, but I confess that I choose Messi because I have a small weakness for him being left-footed. I was a left-footed footballer myself. I can’t choose another one, it’s my style</p>
