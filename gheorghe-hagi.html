  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a>]</b> <b>[. . .]</b> <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Gullit</a> was a legend. He was more powerful than Van Basten, so it was almost impossible to get the ball from him. But he had a different style, and was Van Basten’s perfect partner: every coach’s dream is to have a technical player partnered with a physical one</p>

  <p><b>[Gheorghe <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Hagi</a> says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have changed football forever]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has always had an amazing team behind him. I think that was his luck, to be in a team with 20 extraordinary players. They changed football forever. There were so pragmatic, so simple, going from simple to complicated with a lot of technique. Because what matters is the mind, the talent and the skills of the player, because you have to choose players with talent<br /><br />I learned a lot of him. When he called me at the <b>[1994]</b> World Cup, <b>[to tell me]</b> that he wanted me in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it was a happy day for me. I knew if I went there I would learn a lot from <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> too with the concept. So it was an honour for me to be coached, to learn, to see the hero of my childhood, to be near him, to see how he thinks, to see how he acts if you do something wrong - and that happened two or three times because I made mistakes. I learned a lot from him. All his thoughts about football, how he thought, how he created, how he trained, that was fundamental. I say that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> changed my mind.</p>
