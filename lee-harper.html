  <p>[Unai Emery’s decision to take Mesut Ozil out of the Arsenal starting line-up means that nobody can afford to rest on their laurels] I think Emery’s been fantastic. He’s given everyone a breath of fresh air, changing a few things around tactically and bringing in new ideas. The fact he reportedly left out Mesut Ozil because he wasn’t happy with his work-rate tells you that no one is safe. Everyone knows that they’ve got to go out and perform and give 100 per cent.<br /><br />I think it’s going to be tough on Sunday, as tough as the game against Liverpool. Tottenham are buoyed from a really big win against Chelsea and they have some very good players. I think it’s a bigger game for Arsenal. Tottenham would be more satisfied to come away from the Emirates with a point whereas Arsenal could do with all three to keep themselves right in there at the top. If they lost to Spurs there would be a six-point gap between them and you don’t really want that at this stage of the season. They need to keep on their tails so hopefully they’ll get the win. They’ve passed every test they’ve faced so far on this 18-month unbeaten run and that’s a fantastic achievement, but they’ve also drawn four or five games recently and now they’re 10 points down on Manchester City. They need to pick up some wins as well and there’d be nothing better than picking up a win on Sunday</p>

  <p>[Ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Lee Harper is another who feels that <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, a man cut from the same cloth as <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, could be a success in a demanding post such as <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>] He was a really, really nice guy so, given his experience in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you can’t see why it wouldn’t work if he went to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and gave it a go. He’s had plenty of managerial experience too which should set him up somewhere like that. I don’t see why [he shouldn’t do it]. He’s done some groundwork in management and it would be a good fit. It would be a good challenge. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> are a big club with a great fan base, something Patrick would thrive on. First and foremost, he’s a nice guy and you want to see nice guys do well.<br /><br />He is a winner and he will demand that whoever plays for his team has that mentality and strength. He will be driving people on. I do believe he will be more of a <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> type [of manager] because he is quiet off the pitch. He will have plenty of technical aspects to his training sessions. He is a quiet guy but that doesn’t mean he won’t tell people who need to be told - because of his winning mentality</p>
