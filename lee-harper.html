<blockquote>
  <p>[Ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Lee Harper is another who feels that <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, a man cut from the same cloth as <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, could be a success in a demanding post such as <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>] He was a really, really nice guy so, given his experience in the Premier League, you can’t see why it wouldn’t work if he went to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and gave it a go. He’s had plenty of managerial experience too which should set him up somewhere like that. I don’t see why [he shouldn’t do it]. He’s done some groundwork in management and it would be a good fit. It would be a good challenge. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> are a big club with a great fan base, something Patrick would thrive on. First and foremost, he’s a nice guy and you want to see nice guys do well.<br /><br />He is a winner and he will demand that whoever plays for his team has that mentality and strength. He will be driving people on. I do believe he will be more of a <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> type [of manager] because he is quiet off the pitch. He will have plenty of technical aspects to his training sessions. He is a quiet guy but that doesn’t mean he won’t tell people who need to be told - because of his winning mentality</p>
