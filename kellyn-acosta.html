<blockquote>
  <p>[Kellyn Acosta didn’t have much down time in the winter between FC Dallas’ playoff exit in mid-November and a call-up to the U.S. national team in January] In the offseason, I sat back and reflected on last season, where I had a lot of chances but I didn’t capitalize. The coaches stressed on me to hit the frame. Good things happen when you hit the frame. Both my shots were on target and I was able to capitalize. So, hopefully teammates keep finding me in good spots, and hopefully I can keep capitalizing.<br /><br />Playing against these teams, just like an international they’re from the CONCACAF region. We’re going to be playing against some of these guys that play in Panama or wherever. I think it’s a good test for myself to see where I stand against those guys. I thought I did pretty well and held my own. It’s a different style of play rather than playing in MLS, but I thought collectively we did a great job<br /><br />That’s the next step for me. I feel like I’m finding myself in good spots, but sometimes I am more passive, I look for that pass. I think that’s where I need to be more selfish in that aspect but overall I thought it was a good result by us and I was happy to get two goals</p>

  <p>[Colorado Rapids forward Jonathan Lewis has been added to the U.S. national team’s training camp roster ahead of a June 5 friendly against Jamaica] He’s an important piece for us. He has added a dimension we didn’t have before. You can see his qualities come out, and he’s playing with a ton of confidence</p>
