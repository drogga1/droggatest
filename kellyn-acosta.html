  <p><b>[Kellyn Acosta didn’t have much down time in the winter between FC Dallas’ playoff exit in mid-November and a call-up to the U.S. national team in January]</b> In the offseason, I sat back and reflected on last season, where I had a lot of chances but I didn’t capitalize. The coaches stressed on me to hit the frame. Good things happen when you hit the frame. Both my shots were on target and I was able to capitalize. So, hopefully teammates keep finding me in good spots, and hopefully I can keep capitalizing.<br /><br />Playing against these teams, just like an international they’re from the CONCACAF region. We’re going to be playing against some of these guys that play in Panama or wherever. I think it’s a good test for myself to see where I stand against those guys. I thought I did pretty well and held my own. It’s a different style of play rather than playing in MLS, but I thought collectively we did a great job<br /><br />That’s the next step for me. I feel like I’m finding myself in good spots, but sometimes I am more passive, I look for that pass. I think that’s where I need to be more selfish in that aspect but overall I thought it was a good result by us and I was happy to get two goals</p>

  <p><b>[Kellyn Acosta exemplifies FC Dallas’ fight in CCL win over Pachuca]</b> He said he wanted it. I was like, ‘Nah.’ I went and got it, I was the first one to grab the ball, I was like, ‘No, this is mine,’ and I’m glad I could finish it off.<br /><br />Yeah, that was a technique thing, that wasn’t really a play or anything like that. I was just hitting them poorly. I think once the game went on I kind of hit them a little bit better. I had maybe a couple of dangerous ones. It was pretty poor by me. I need to put time in on the practice field and hope I can get better</p>

  <p><b>[Pareja also has a confident Kellyn Acosta, who has scored three goals in the CCL knockout stage thus far and is eager to add another]</b> We’re going out there, we’re going to look for them from the start. We’re going to take the game to them. We’re not going to sit back. We’re going to go out there and score some goals. That’s our overall focus. We’re going to try to win the game. We’re not going out here to look for a tie. We’re going out there to win.</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas puts aside CONCACAF Champions League dream - for now]</b> It was a great result for the team. We can’t really dwell too much on the game against Pachuca. We really wanted to bounce back in front of our fans in our home and continue on the path</p>

  <p><b>[On Carlos Gruezo]</b> Today especially I think we were well connected. I was trying to be close to him because they put a lot of bodies in the middle. It was definitely imperative for me to kind of be connected to him so we can limit their space on the ball. I think we did a tremendous job. Hopefully we can continue that.</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas hopes Mauro Diaz’s return sparks languid attack]</b> We’re just lacking that final touch, that thought in the final third and it’s been ineffectiveness. We aren’t as dangerous as we usually are. We need to reevaluate ourselves and each of us needs to take one gear up and step up. I know it’s just a phase right now. We’re going to bounce back, the goals are going to come, the wins are going to come but we need to be patient and just keep moving forward.<br /><br />I think it’s a collective thing. We can’t rely on Mauro to do everything. Everyone needs to step up their game and play. He’s not the only one. We have 11 guys out there to make a difference. I think if everyone steps up we’ll be in good shape</p>

  <p><b>[USA’s win against Ghana]</b> It was definitely tough getting thrown out there with guys you aren’t familiar with, but I thought overall we did a great job. I think defensively we were very sound. Ghana’s a very athletic team and i thought we were all connected. We’re finding each other in spaces and we knew when to cover. I thought the partnership was great. It’s a great start to what’s going to be a great month. Definitely room to grow. I think we’re just trying to build chemistry and that happens with games and consistency. As it goes on, the partnership will get stronger. Overall the first game together I thought we did a pretty good job</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas All-Stars improvise to face ‘world’s best’ Real Madrid]</b> When I saw Greg go down and Beas went in, I just looked across the bench and I was like, ‘Man, either they play three in the back or I’m going to have to go left back’. But I figured I was going to have to go. I mean, ideally, that’s not a place I want to play, but I just wanted to compete and be on the field<br /><br />I felt like I was just playing by myself over there, playing 2 v. 1, 1 v. 1 with one of the best players in the world. But it was definitely cool and I was glad I was a part of it, no matter what position I was in<br /><br />I knew even if it was a young kid in front of me, they’re obviously there for a reason. They’re talented players. I just knew whoever was in front of me was going to be a tough matchup. I knew I needed to be mentally focused and be ready to whoever came out, I just had to be prepared or they were going to really expose me. But overall it was a fun experience</p>

He has added a dimension we didn’t have before. You can see his qualities come out, and he’s playing with a ton of confidence</p>
