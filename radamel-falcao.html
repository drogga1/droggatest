  <p><b>[Monaco striker Radamel Falcao has revealed that he rejected no less than three offers to move to the Chinese Super League]</b> It’s not easy to refuse such an offer. I’ve already said no three times about going over there. And I believe that it’s also not easy for the club, who have turned down a lot of money. But I feel something in my body, it’s important for my career and for the team to be here. I want to win with Monaco. I want to show that I’m at 100 per cent.<br /><br />No, the coach calls up players who play in China. But I dream of winning something with Monaco</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; Chelsea flop Radamel Falcao is back to his brilliant best]</b> It was the worst moment of my career. I had difficult times after my surgery when I thought about giving up. But I managed to start again and keep hope in my future.<br /><br />I’ve had a chance to play and I’ve proven to everyone that I’m still at a high level. hat I was missing was the chance to play and to accumulate matches. In England, I had two complicated years. There were a number of reasons for that … The context was not easy there. And it was even more difficult because I was not playing. Jardim was important for my decision to come back. I spoke to him and he knew I was 100 per cent. And now we can work towards the future.</p>

I hope we can continue to live here. <b>[A new contract]</b> depends on <b>[vice-president]</b> Vadim Vasilyev and the owner. I feel very good, happy and the results are good.

I often talk about it with my wife. I think when I finish my football career, I’ll start one as a professional baseball player. Like Michael Jordan, even if he was a basketball player and did not get to play in the big leagues, at the highest level. I want to be the first to succeed!</p>
