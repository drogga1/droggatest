  <p><b>[Colombia goal machine Radamel Falcao’s World Cup dream is finally here]</b> Everything in life is a lesson and one can take advantage of this if they can find something in every situation. These types of adverse experiences teach you and I tried to learn; to assimilate as much as possible, and to put into practice as much as possible. For me, it was like this: I didn’t let that moment pass without gaining something for my life.</p>

  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao tells about his love of another sport]</b> I love baseball. When I was little, in Venezuela, where I grew up, it was the sport I played, at a very good level. I often talk about it with my wife. I think when I finish my football career, I’ll start one as a professional baseball player. Like Michael Jordan, even if he was a basketball player and did not get to play in the big leagues, at the highest level. I want to be the first to succeed!</p>

If <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> scores a goal, people ask for two. If he scores a free-kick, they’ll say the wall wasn’t set up properly. If Argentina lose, it will be talked about like it was his fault. That’s the price you pay for being the best player in the world.<br /><br />We can’t think that we are favourites after beating <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s Argentina. A lot is missing.
