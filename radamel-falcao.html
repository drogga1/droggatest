  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao tries valiantly to convince everyone that he believes in the project at Monaco. Nobody believes him]</b> I’m very happy at Monaco and I believe in the project. I feel good at the club. I believe in the Monaco project and I’m going to stay here</p>

  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao tells about his love of another sport]</b> I love baseball. When I was little, in Venezuela, where I grew up, it was the sport I played, at a very good level. I often talk about it with my wife. I think when I finish my football career, I’ll start one as a professional baseball player. Like Michael Jordan, even if he was a basketball player and did not get to play in the big leagues, at the highest level. I want to be the first to succeed!</p>

  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao insisted the injury that forced him off the field at half-time of Colombia’s 3-0 friendly victory over Panama was nothing to worry about]</b> I’m fine, it was just part of the game. But there’s nothing to worry about. It was just a knock</p>

  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao has defended Lionel Messi after Agentina loss to Columbia]</b> Messi was close to scoring against us, but he is sure to convert in the next couple of matches. If Messi scores a goal, people ask for two. If he scores a free-kick, they’ll say the wall wasn’t set up properly. If Argentina lose, it will be talked about like it was his fault. That’s the price you pay for being the best player in the world.<br /><br />We can’t think that we are favourites after beating Messi’s Argentina. A lot is missing. We are just starting and anything can happen. If you fall asleep here, you will lose</p>

  <p><b>[Falcao ‘studying’ offers to move away from Monaco this summer]</b> The truth is that I still have a year of contract and the club did not offer me an extension.

I have to think about my family.<br /><br /><b>[Among the clubs linked with the forward are <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> and <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, and though Monaco have maintained that only an extraordinary offer would be good enough to sign him, Falcao says he believes the club understand his position on wanting to move on]</b> I still have only one year of contract and it’s complicated for a player of my age.
