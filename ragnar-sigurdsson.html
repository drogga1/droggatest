  <p>[Tottenham &amp; Liverpool target Sessegnon tipped for Premier League move] One hundred per cent [he can play in the Premier League], he’s a great talent, he just turned 17 and he played more than half of the games this season, he scored a lot of goals. He has a very bright future. I’m just surprised he didn’t get any offers during the season. I think he was that good. There’s no surprise there [in reported interest].<br /><br />I’m always looking forward. What’s done is done. Of course, we were all disappointed for maybe one or two weeks after the game but now I’m on a new mission so all my hope is on the national team now. I haven’t really spoken to the guys much since we parted. I just came straight home and started training with the national team but I’m very sure the ambition of the players and the club is to be a Premier League team because we showed we can play magnificent football, so I definitely think that’s the ambition</p>

  <p>[Ragnar Sigurdsson insists that Iceland believe they can win every game they play] You wouldn’t believe the belief people have in us, it’s amazing. Even if we’re playing against Croatia, at home or away, everyone thinks we’re going to win the game. Even if we met England again, people would think we have a good chance of winning, that’s helped us, the belief we have in ourselves. The belief Icelandic people have in us is really such a motivation for us.<br /><br />I think qualifying for the World Cup would top qualifying for the Euros but only qualifying for the World Cup would not pass our achievements in the Euros. If we go to the World Cup we have to do something there to top our performance in the Euros. We really try hard not to get ahead of ourselves because we are a nation of 330,000 people so the goal now is just to qualify. That’d be an amazing achievement on its own and if we do that then we start setting the ambition of what we want to do next<br /><br />Yeah, we can do it. If we play a good game and we are concentrated then we can hold anybody down but you can never say beforehand what’s going to happen. We believe we can beat them and keep their key players down</p>
