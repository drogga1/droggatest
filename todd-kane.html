  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea youngster Todd <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> reflects on missed Blues opportunity]</b> That was the moment where I was close to making it. I had Michael Emenalo and <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> come to watch me ahead of taking over, against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. They also watched me against Vitesse Arnhem. After that second game, they told me I was going to be involved in the first-team. Then, three or four months down the line I did my anterior cruciate ligament. I knew from that moment that it wasn’t going to happen for me at Chelsea<br /><br />I had <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> on the table last January. I was supposed to be moving to <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> but the deal didn’t get done for whatever reason. Then, in the summer, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> wanted me at Derby before he moved to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It would have been an easy decision to go and work with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> at Derby. I felt like it would have been a great move for my career, then that was out of the window. Then QPR stepped forward. Over the summer, there were other clubs interested which is normal. I felt I had to wait just a little bit and get my options on the table. I went to chat to all the managers and see what the best for my next step is. Knowing QPR as a London club as well and knowing <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a> and the gaffer <a href="mark-warburton.html">Mark Warburton</a>, I thought it would be a great club to play for. The manager called me up for a chat and after I walked out of the room very positive. I said: ‘Let’s get the deal done’, and it was done within 24 hours. Now, I am here full time. I have a permanent deal so they have backed me. It is nice to be at a club knowing I am not going on loan anywhere. Now I want to progress for them as well as for myself.<br /><br /><b>[Despite that he bears no grudges and is happy to see the likes of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> now making an impact]</b> I have had to have thick skin and get on after my setbacks. I feel like I have been unlucky. When I was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when I was younger, I couldn’t get that opportunity and now it is different. I got in the Champions League final squad in 2012 and I am surprised I never got to make an appearance. The manager turnover made it difficult but I had great memories. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has given the opportunity and that’s what it is about. I had that in my head years ago that I would leave but I have had to just do the right thing to get back playing while on loan, get my injury out of the way and get back stronger. I am grateful that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> looked after me like that<br /><br />Often, because of my own high standards, when I walk away from a game and look at my performance, I have found it tough because I know I can play better. What really matters is being at QPR and making these memories for myself in a senior team. There’s no telling what happens. I want to experience playing in these big occasions and I’ll do it by doing well for QPR. I have walked off the pitch feeling disappointed at QPR because I haven’t had that rhythm or flow that I know I am capable of. The number one aim has always been to get in the play-offs. That has been the mentality from the start of the season. We want to get in there then anything can happen in the play-offs. That’s our goal. To perform in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is something any player wants to experience. I am just turning 26 and I had 18 months out of the game so I do feel like I have the hunger of a 24-year-old. I am very fit and I am coming into my prime. By 29, I really want to get into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to really test myself. After my career, when I look back, I want to say I have experienced <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after being so close.</p>
