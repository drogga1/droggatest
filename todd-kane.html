  <p><b>[Todd Kane had agreed to return to Chelsea to fight for a place in Antonio Conte’s starting line up after starring for NEC Nijmegen during the 2015-16 campaign]</b> My development at NEC Nijmegen was good, I was going to be in the Chelsea first team. I was told I was going to be in the squad and that I would go back for pre-season but obviously, in my last game of NEC’s season, I injured my knee. That was very disappointing to me, very frustrating. It is what it is and coming here is a new chapter to kick back on and get myself back in the shop window and performing. Emotionally, having never really had an injury before, I was thrown in the deep end.<br /><br />I didn’t know how to cope with it really, knowing I was inches away from my dream and having it taken away from me by an injury - I was gutted. I had treatment and operations. I started to train but it was hard being around the training ground with Chelsea’s games going on. Other people were playing ahead of me and it was very tough. I got through it and that’s the only way, but I admit that it was very difficult. It was good to see them winning as a fan of the club but inside I knew I should have been part of it. It really got to me some days but I was happy for the team.<br /><br />Inside it was hard, after working towards that for years. My family were there for me. I had people close to me getting me through it and the physiotherapists at Chelsea worked with me on a daily basis. Every day, I was down at Cobham with them and I was either pissed off that I was hurt or happy that I had made some progress. They went on the journey with me. It was hard for me and the people who were close to me<br /><br />Bigger clubs came in for me but I felt that this was the right one to develop at. I had unfinished business in this league. It opens so many doors around Europe and not just in England. I am always open to playing abroad. I felt it was the right decision.<br /><br />I had opportunities to move on loan in January last year. I could have gone to Groningen or other clubs but I spoke to them and I felt I wasn’t ready. I didn’t want to push it, it was such a big injuries and I wanted to make sure I was right and ready for this season.<br /><br />I class myself as a technical right-back. I get up and down, like to put in crosses and like a tackle - a modern-day full-back really. My idol is Philip Lahm and to open doors abroad, the football here in the Netherlands is perfect to the way I play.<br /><br />In England, when I played in the Championship, I was always held back and not selected. I was too attacking minded, I was too small. I heard all these excuses from managers. I don’t believe in that my size is an issue. Abroad, if you can play football and have a good brain then you are good enough to play.<br /><br />I have had a hard 13-14 months on the sidelines but I have recharged my batteries, I have done a pre-season but the manager is looking after me really. He doesn’t want to throw me straight in at the deep end. He knows how I am, I know my body also, I am just waiting for the right time to start a game.<br /><br />I did 10 minutes on the opening day, got the buzz back from that. Maybe I will be ready to start against Ajax. The manager says I will be a massive part this season, he just wants to make sure that I am right. I feel right, I am ready to go and I am raring to go<br /><br />Yeah, Terry is a massive influence on me. JT was at the club at the time of my injury and I have always had a great relationship with him. The first day I was back in England, I had a call from him. He was sympathising with my situation and telling me to keep my head up and he said he would be there for me if I needed anything. I was seeing him around the training ground during my recovery, he was always there to help when I needed something. It was great to have someone there who I was close to and who is a role model for me and the rest of the people at the club. It was nice to have someone to talk to who understands the football life, the highs and the lows<br /><br />Being in the Champions League final squad when I was 18-years-old was huge. As a Chelsea fan as well, I couldn’t believe it when I got told I was travelling and I would be involved<br /><br />I trained on the pitch on the night before the game, the press was bigger than I had seen. Arriving at the hotel, staying in Munich, it felt like I was in a movie. It was surreal. On the day of the game, I was told I was going to be on the bench. I could see my family from the balcony outside my room and I called them to tell them I’d be on the bench. From that moment in time, I felt to myself that my number one goal is to play in the Champions League final. I obviously hope it is with Chelsea but if it was with anyone else, it would still be a fantastic opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea youngster Todd <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> reflects on missed Blues opportunity]</b> That was the moment where I was close to making it. I had Michael Emenalo and <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> come to watch me ahead of taking over, against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. They also watched me against Vitesse Arnhem. After that second game, they told me I was going to be involved in the first-team. Then, three or four months down the line I did my anterior cruciate ligament. I knew from that moment that it wasn’t going to happen for me at Chelsea<br /><br />I had <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> on the table last January. I was supposed to be moving to <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> but the deal didn’t get done for whatever reason. Then, in the summer, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> wanted me at Derby before he moved to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It would have been an easy decision to go and work with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> at Derby. I felt like it would have been a great move for my career, then that was out of the window. Then QPR stepped forward. Over the summer, there were other clubs interested which is normal. I felt I had to wait just a little bit and get my options on the table. I went to chat to all the managers and see what the best for my next step is. Knowing QPR as a London club as well and knowing <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a> and the gaffer <a href="mark-warburton.html">Mark Warburton</a>, I thought it would be a great club to play for. The manager called me up for a chat and after I walked out of the room very positive. I said: ‘Let’s get the deal done’, and it was done within 24 hours. Now, I am here full time. I have a permanent deal so they have backed me. It is nice to be at a club knowing I am not going on loan anywhere. Now I want to progress for them as well as for myself.<br /><br /><b>[Despite that he bears no grudges and is happy to see the likes of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> now making an impact]</b> I have had to have thick skin and get on after my setbacks. I feel like I have been unlucky. When I was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when I was younger, I couldn’t get that opportunity and now it is different. I got in the Champions League final squad in 2012 and I am surprised I never got to make an appearance. The manager turnover made it difficult but I had great memories. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has given the opportunity and that’s what it is about. I had that in my head years ago that I would leave but I have had to just do the right thing to get back playing while on loan, get my injury out of the way and get back stronger. I am grateful that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> looked after me like that<br /><br />Often, because of my own high standards, when I walk away from a game and look at my performance, I have found it tough because I know I can play better. What really matters is being at QPR and making these memories for myself in a senior team. There’s no telling what happens. I want to experience playing in these big occasions and I’ll do it by doing well for QPR. I have walked off the pitch feeling disappointed at QPR because I haven’t had that rhythm or flow that I know I am capable of. The number one aim has always been to get in the play-offs. That has been the mentality from the start of the season. We want to get in there then anything can happen in the play-offs. That’s our goal. To perform in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is something any player wants to experience. I am just turning 26 and I had 18 months out of the game so I do feel like I have the hunger of a 24-year-old. I am very fit and I am coming into my prime. By 29, I really want to get into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to really test myself. After my career, when I look back, I want to say I have experienced <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after being so close.</p>
