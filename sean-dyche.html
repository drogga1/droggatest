Apparently it’s really sunny out there compared to here. It was a nice flight and he didn’t get sick. The food wasn’t great on the flight but he came back with one of those hats <b>[sombrero]</b> and those donkeys <b>[pinata]</b> which my folks brought back in the 70s and told everyone they were fantastic. He bought me them which I thought was a nice gesture</p>

I was pretty sure he was still a top-class keeper. There can be different reasons why you play well at some places and not others. Sometimes you just fit naturally. You can sense it.<br /><br />For keepers, sometimes what is in front of you helps. He wants a defensive unit he has faith with. I think there is a nice connection here. Possibly at other clubs he didn’t find that connection. But a lot of credit goes to him for finding his way again<br /><br /><b>[It places even more weight behind Heaton’s public admission he may need to look elsewhere after recovering from his own injury troubles to find himself playing second choice to Hart]</b> I thought Tom spoke very well. He knows he has a future here. It is how he feels about that. Whatever needs to be worked out, will be worked out</p>

We have been linked with him over the past couple of years and things sometimes hold deals up, or get in the way, but the time was right, I think. Even from a business point of view, it’s a pretty good deal overall for a very good player. He’s proved that over the past couple of years and shown he still has goals in him. But he’s also got that competitive instinct to play in a team that wants to compete.</p>

No. So let’s crack on. Have you ever thought they might not want you to have any idea? This thing about ‘the next gay footballer’. Imagine the noise around that. They might not want it.

Listen, I’m not anti-tattoo, I just don’t understand it. It is not the tattoos. It’s that you can start believing in these things more than the job.

  <p><b>[Burnley boss Sean Dyche has drawn a line under an incident involving Danny Drinkwater in which the midfielder was reportedly attacked outside a nightclub]</b> The big picture is he is a 29-year-old footballer and nobody wants to get into this situation. He knows that. On the other side, he is a human being and we have all been involved in not-so-good times.<br /><br />Forget about the footballer. Sometimes people get into scrapes. But he is wise enough and old enough to know not to. You can’t just talk about development when it’s good news, though. You have to talk: more so if things aren’t going well. When you take a player in he becomes a part of us. So we will work with Danny and try to help him and, importantly, he has to get himself fit<br /><br />We spoke, but only stuff about what he needs to do here. That was more the case. It’s just common sense. He’s 29, he understands these situations happen, but he knows it’s not good, and equally he’s old enough to know how to conduct himself. It’s just the way it goes sometimes. Life happens</p>

The game will be a farce. We didn’t use to accept it, but I seem to be the only one who is bothered about it. The big key moment in our mentality was the penalty, I can’t abide it, as everyone knows, I don’t know why it’s in the game. I said at the beginning of the season, we were told by <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the worst you can get is a yellow card, so everyone has a chance to cheat once and not get sent off.

I’m not backward in coming forward. I’ve been told by other prominent managers to stop going on about it because it will affect my career. I said, ‘Sorry, not my bag’. You have to be true to yourself and able to look at yourself in the mirror. A couple of managers said it could affect me. I’m the bad guy, don’t forget. But at the end of the day, it was a passing comment over a chat, and I said it wasn’t my thing<br /><br />Bear in mind I’ve been in football all my life, I’ve watched it all my life, at every age group, from seven, which my lad Max played in, through every age group … and people are going down with nothing wrong with them, and all that. And somehow I end up coming out of it the bad guy. I can’t fathom it at all. I keep meeting people - unless I only happen to meet the only people who don’t like diving - fans who’ve caned us, but then saying, ‘By the way, you were right though about diving’.<br /><br />I don’t know how it happens, people factually diving, feigning injury - which is even worse than diving - and I mention it, and people say I’m making excuses. Eh? I’ve been making excuses for five years? How’s that then, we’re still in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, what excuses am I making? They all see it with their own eyes, yet it, ‘No, I don’t think so, he touched his earlobe with his breath’. That makes it all right then.

Anyway, it was just a life moment, that I thought was quite interesting. <br /><br />I spoke to him more than I have before, ever. We had a good 10 minutes, and he was very polite, very kind to my family. It was an interesting moment in a city of eight-odd million people. I was on my way to Poundstretchers by the way - he was on his way to Harrods!<br /><br />His face was actually more shocked than mine, because he was plodding along and I saw him with his hat on, and he shot his head up and said a bad word, and then said, ‘Sorry, your wife and children are there!’. But he was very pleasant - as he would be after smashing us the day before. But we had six or seven minutes chatting about how he’s settling, life in general, that sort of stuff.

  <p><b>[Burnley boss Dyche admits sale of Dwight McNeil could happen]</b> There’s a reality when players come in, particularly when we’ve developed them as lower-league players for less money or the likes of Dwight McNeil. At some point those players, not all of them, but some of them get to a point where the club will sell them. Just by the natural economics they’re going to go ‘well, OK, what did we bring that player in for and what’s the offer?’. The difference is that offer is now stretched because we don’t actually need the money. In the past, we always had to do certain things. Now we don’t have to do them because we’re in a very strong financial position. Keano went and it was a case of we can’t refuse that money. Now we can. That’s the difference, although the basic principle is still there. If a player does so, so well and enough big interest comes from the top of the market, the chances are at some point that situation breaks and that player goes<br /><br />It’s part of the reality of the club, we’re not giants in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We can’t pay the wages that other clubs pay and some of the numbers that these players get are astronomical. They’re miles above what we can pay. When that moment comes, I have to factor that in a little bit as well and say ‘look, this is a chance for them to go and get whatever that may be and we can’t compete with that’. The business comes first, of course, but there’s also a bit of moral fibre there and we can’t stop a player from having that opportunity. But I can assure you it will only happen if the numbers are correct. The numbers now in our world are high and we’re in a position to say no, we don’t need to sell anyone. So if anyone wants to come for any of our players, they had better have a war chest</p>

  <p><b>[Sean Dyche exclusive: Inside life in the transfer market at Burnley]</b> Trust me, if you ring a League Two club for a player, you think they’ll say: ‘Ah, we want about £100k for him.’ They don’t. They say: ‘We want £17m!’ There’s no rhyme or reason in the market now, you either pay it, or you don’t<br /><br />If you want to really, really jump, you’ve got to be looking at the £25m mark. I don’t think this club will do that. So, therefore, we are always in this lower bracket anyway<br /><br />As a club that doesn’t want to put money out there and hope, we have to try and make the signings that are edging towards ‘these are going to work,’ rather than a ‘right let’s just wait and see if he works, we’ll just take them anyway,’ which some clubs do. They go on a 50/50 risk with signings, whereas we’ve got to try and make it 70/30 in our favour. So that’s where it gets tricky and difficult<br /><br />I think it’s an enjoyable challenge because it’s something I believe in, and always have done. When I first went into coaching with the <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> Under-18s, my main aim was to give them more than I had received in my career. I thought if I could give them more, and they develop, that is the key. And I strongly believe that as a manager now. Of course you’ve got to get results, but if you can do that in a way that the players are benefiting, growing, maturing, you’re raising your chances of winning again anyway.<br /><br />I always believe that if you affect the person, you affect their performance. Regardless of their background, wherever they are from, old or young, that’s still the key: ‘Can I affect the person in a manner that improves their performance?’. It’s good that I believe in it because we’ve had to do it! It’s rare that we go out and spend big money, so it has become part of what we do. But it does become more difficult, because you can’t get these players. Even the ones we have developed, how quickly can you get them to be effective? Because a lot of them actually haven’t played <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football<br /><br />That’s with the chairman at the moment. I’ve offered what we think is appropriate, and so has Mike Rigg and the powers that be in the club, and eventually it does come down to the chairman at some point, because he has to give it the sign-off for getting it done. There are situations, but we’ll wait and see<br /><br />I think the early signs of this lockdown are that the big superpowers are still going to be spending a lot of money. It suggests there’s money out there to be spent. Whether or not is softens slightly, we’ll see. In our world, our markets are not the main market. We don’t always sign other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players, or big players from Europe, with financial reasons being the first one. There may possibly be a softening in the Championship and below. We’re going to have to wait and see, but we often have to wait and see anyway! It’s very rare that we say: ‘Here’s a big fat cheque, we want your player!’ so it’s often the waiting game.<br /><br />It will certainly be up there as an achievement, because the last time we finished seventh we didn’t have all of these challenges. We had a fully fit squad, and we were going well.<br /><br />The daily issue is getting players fit, and the weekly one is the same! Getting players fit and out there. I wait for the physio to come in, with that look, and you give him that look back, almost like a horror film where you have your head behind the cushion, and you think: ‘I hope he’s going to give me good news!</p>

With such a short period now for the games, it is unlikely them two are going to make up the games. With Corky and Ben I am not envisaging at this moment that it rolls into next season, I think they will be fit and well.<br /><br />It is one of them unfortunate things, let’s face it it could have come at a time when we weren’t in the shape we are in. You can quickly forget we are at 46 points, our second-highest total we have ever had in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We have achieved that so far with these challenges. If these challenges would have come before we had a good run of seven without defeat then things could have been different. These injuries and different challenges have come at a time when we have got good points on the table so there is a balance to the situation. Forty-six points at this stage is no mean feat for clubs like ourselves.</p>

Different people are trying to use it in different ways, but I think the intention was just to get some drinks down people and then get on with it<br /><br />You can get the message onto the pitch much easier with no one in the stadium anyway.

I just think if we had the full complement of players where we could make the changes, and more of them when needed, even if during a game. Then I’d like to think we could challenge for our highest total level. I’m not saying we can’t. I just think it’s slightly more tricky.</p>

We just about hung in there with the goalkeeper making a few saves. At half-time, I said even top sides find it hard to maintain that level for an entire game. I thought we were a threat from set-pieces all day and we took our chance<br /><br />I thought Popey was excellent apart from he had his shoes on the wrong feet because of his kicking. His job is to keep the ball out of the net and he does that very well. I thought the substitutes helped us grow into the game. Jay Rod is a great pro and he chips in with a number of important goals<br /><br />He’s been performing well all season. One of his biggest strengths is when he makes a mistake, he just gets on with it. He’s unorthodox in the sense that he makes saves you wouldn’t expect him to make. He’s well protected by his defenders and he’s respectful of those in front of him too. We’ve built a mentality and a resilience over some time</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> was left frustrated after coming up against an inspired Nick Pope during the 1-1 draw with <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> at Anfield]</b> I’m very pleased, considering we hardly got into the game in the first half. We just about hung in there with the goalkeeper making a few saves. At half-time, I said even top sides find it hard to maintain that level for an entire game. I thought we were a threat from set-pieces all day and we took our chance.<br /><br />The technical detail of football has advanced, but you still need a heartbeat and a group of people who care. I still think that’s so important in elite sport, and we’ve got it in abundance. I thought as the game went on, into the last 10 minutes, we looked really physically strong. There was a clear attempt to go and win the game and we were unfortunate at the end<br /><br />I know the game could’ve been out of sight early on, but we dug in and created better chances in the second half. If there’s ever an advert for a team giving everything it has been us during this run of games and results. The players worked very hard to get something from the game and they deserve everything they got<br /><br />I thought Popey was excellent apart from he had his shoes on the wrong feet because of his kicking.

  <p><b>[Sean Dyche says Nick Pope, James Tarkowski and Dwight McNeil worthy of England call]</b> I’ve always said I’ve never got in the way of Gareth’s choosing of the side, I get on well with Gareth when I speak to him. Would I offer the obvious that <b>[Pope]</b> is playing very well? Yes. I think James Tarkowski as well is playing very well, amongst others, Dwight <b>[McNeil]</b>. Dwight’s getting towards a full season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at 20 years old. After playing half a season last season he’s hardly missed a minute, to be fair to the lad. So there are three I’d certainly offer are playing well enough to be considered. Obviously Pope’s got some accolades and rightly so. Some by just doing the basics very well, which he did against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, and then some making really big saves like he did on Saturday<br /><br />I like what they do, I like their side. I think they’ve got a good mixture in the squad that they’ve got. Nothing but positives from me for what they try to achieve and how they go about it</p>

  <p><b>[Dyche: We’ll always be punching above our weight]</b> Well I don’t think it changes radically, we’ll always be punching somewhat above our weight. There’s a clutch of clubs similar-ish in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> who are not going out there spending vast amounts of money, but we think we develop well<br /><br />I think they are two different animals, quite obviously. So I don’t think I’m going to get involved in who’s got what, we just manage what we have got rather than worrying too much about what we haven’t got and try and create a team and a way of working that is effective enough to take points and win games.<br /><br />That’s what it is, as simple as that. The ruling is nothing to do with me, I don’t know the ins and outs of it, all I know is that there is one less place available</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Wood’s 96th-minute penalty secured a 1-1 draw for <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> to dent Wolves’ Champions League hopes]</b> Another interesting twist went our way and we produced another good finish to a game which had its problems with the injuries. To come out with a point against a really good side from the challenges we’re having is really pleasing. Woody showed a great mentality and he grew into the game. When he missed the chance, it goes to show you what a strong character he’s got to step up and score the penalty. I was a long way from the incident, but I’ve looked back at it and it does look a clear case of handball</p>

  <p><b>[Dyche says it is another example of a rule change helping the elite and hindering smaller clubs like Burnley]</b> I think it quite obviously favours the big clubs because they can keep more players happy and more players involved by making more changes. A lot of football often does. We all had to change the size of our home pitches to make sure they aligned with the big clubs who were in Europe. We all had to cut the grass the same length. So most things are pushed forward by the big clubs in the division. But equally the big clubs are part of what sells the division to the world. They are fantastic clubs in their own right, they have got amazing histories and a lot of prowess in football. It could be a slightly calmer situation for managers <b>[of bigger clubs]</b> with players who get slightly disgruntled than if they’re out of the team and out of the squad. We will look to deliver first, and if you can deliver a performance you often get the outcome you want. Having been through that <b>[relegation]</b> I still think there will be a pride and passion from them towards the game. We’ve got to safeguard against that by being ready to deliver another performance. So I think we go there open-minded, as we have done with all these games after lockdown. We’ve got to remind the players that is going to be needed. We don’t take anyone in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> lightly, nor should we, because it is so tough going around winning games. We’ve had that unfortunate experience like <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>. We went down the first time we came up and I think we finished win, draw, win. I know it sounds crazy but the pressure release is off. It’s done now and weirdly that opens people up a little bit</p>
