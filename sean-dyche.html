The food wasn’t great on the flight but he came back with one of those hats <b>[sombrero]</b> and those donkeys <b>[pinata]</b> which my folks brought back in the 70s and told everyone they were fantastic.

He just wants to get on with it. I was pretty sure he was still a top-class keeper. There can be different reasons why you play well at some places and not others. Sometimes you just fit naturally. You can sense it.<br /><br />For keepers, sometimes what is in front of you helps. He wants a defensive unit he has faith with. I think there is a nice connection here. Possibly at other clubs he didn’t find that connection. But a lot of credit goes to him for finding his way again<br /><br /><b>[It places even more weight behind Heaton’s public admission he may need to look elsewhere after recovering from his own injury troubles to find himself playing second choice to Hart]</b> I thought Tom spoke very well.

  <p><b>[Burnley vs Chelsea]</b> We’ve shown in the past and on numerous occasions that we can earn wins off these teams. It’s just that statistically it’s more difficult, but there is a badge of honour when you take points off these teams. The main thing is reminding the players about the level of our performance and how important that is. Performances over a season will pay you back and we’ve been a bit up and down with that - even during games - so consistency is what we are looking for and we’re getting back towards that</p>

But bags of some kind, that’s all.<br /><br /><b>[David Luiz labeling their style as anti-football]</b> They can have whatever opinion they want. Everyone is allowed an opinion. If we could afford the players they have, I’d love - all managers - to play 600 pass football and win all the time. But it’s simply not that easy. You have to do what you do to win and be successful. Look at the amount of players we’ve developed, the diligence of the group, where the players have come from to play in the Premier League… You have to enjoy the moment, and we certainly enjoyed the moment<br /><br />You have to play some football to get that many points. We’re in a super strong position, but you work on facts.

One hundred and fifty games of Premier League football gives you the ability to have the calmness and the clarity to see what you need to do.<br /><br />I’ve got nothing to do with the title race. I’ve got no motives other than to try and win the game. We want to play hard against everyone. We want points on the board</p>

  <p><b>[Dyche quietens Premier League ‘noise’ to keep Burnley part of the establishment]</b> You’ve got to know. Are you that far away from where you need to be? And I didn’t think we were. It seems crazy, but I genuinely didn’t think we were miles away from where we should be. I think there was a real acceptance. There were no excuses, no sweeping anything under the carpet. It’s the old Muhammad Ali quote, skill without will is useless<br /><br />It’s probably my best season if you just went pure management. Finishing seventh last season is a pretty amazing thing but the best task I’ve fulfilled is making sure we are still in the Premier League this season. I take more value in this season, turning it around, than I did last year because you are talking about real management. When things are going well for you it’s not as big a challenge as when it’s going wrong and you’ve got to correct it. That’s the hardest challenge in management. I stayed pretty strong to what I believe is right for these players because guess who knows them the best? Me<br /><br />Branding in football is such a big conversation now. But whatever your branding is, you’ve got to win. In my time here, think how many managers have come and gone who used that phrase: ‘We’re going to play the right way’. Think how many managers are out of work. One style is not going to win the day every game. If we all had the best players in the world, we’d all play the most beautiful format we could play as long as that can then win games, because in my job guess what I’m paid to do? Win games. If we played glorious football and went down, what do you honestly think the fans would be doing? We haven’t got amazing groups of individuals, four or five individuals who can turn everything. We have to play like a team. I want productive mixed play. How many ways can you affect a game? We try to offer the players many different ways of working. But you do get put in a box sometimes. It’s certainly not something I lose sleep over. Six-and-a-half years, the change in this football club is enormous. You can’t just put that on ‘Oh, they put the ball forward’ because you’ve got to see the whole thing<br /><br />Take Man City. Are they allowed to have 600 passes and bring in players for £50 million? Every player is £50m so you’re talking about fairness, then that’s a different ball game. We deliberately did not try to take them on at their game because there’s only one winner. Now other teams, we feel we can take them on at our game and not worry too much about theirs and I think we’ve done that<br /><br />Imagine my players’ lives from six-and-a-half years ago, the ones that have been with us all the time. Look at their lives now compared to where they were. Trudging along with a mid-table Championship side, now they’ve been recognised for England, they’ve been recognised through the kudos of the promotions, staying in the Premier League. Contractually, they’ll certainly be recognised. I think there’ll be meat on the table at a weekend as my dad used to say. They’ll be alright. So there’s more to it than: ‘Oh why aren’t they playing this way?’. I know how to play. But I equally know you’ve got to make that work. And you’ve got to get success. And success in our world is quite simply winning<br /><br />Underneath some of the great play at Man City, their teamwork is the thing that’s actually seeing them right. They had it at Barcelona as well. They do the basics, make no mistake. They press, they play, they get back in shape, they work the backline, they work the pitch, they shorten the pitch, they do all the teamwork things really well. For all the beauty of Man City, trust me, they do all the hard yards. They do all the ugly bits of the game. Pep Guardiola is no mug, he knows you’ve got to do that to be truly successful. It will never go out of fashion in the eyes of managers. That is the ability to work for everything you get<br /><br />It’s not like the maximum of Burnley’s ambition is to be seventh. It’s just a reality. Where can you go? Where can you take it? For us building is about internal development, external recruitment, continued-building on what we’ve done as a club and continuing to find a way. The chequebook isn’t going to solve it. It’s very healthy from a manager’s point of view, but it can be frustrating as well. Because we keep building on something and then every time you get to a point of: ‘Come on then!’ it’s like the club has to be what it is<br /><br />You don’t have to look very far this season for clubs that have spent heavily in Europe and gone down. There’s a bit of a myth that you pre-suppose every European player is better than every English player. It’s dying a little bit now because there’s a resurgence in the national side, the under-19s, the under-20s and stuff like that. It’s not just skill level. In the Premier League you need more than just skill. In Europe there may be some more technical players but can they adapt to the challenge of Premier League football? It’s faster, it’s stronger, the desire of it, the willingness of every team. Then when you add in a layer of our chairman and our club don’t want to take a gamble. So they don’t want to sign a £15m French player who’s never played in the Premier League, who’s 21, and then that ends up being a £4m French player going back the other way. If you look through the Premier League there’s a lot of those stories<br /><br />It’s moulding their mindset into what they need to do. Players come in whether it’s a big fee or not and go: ‘Yeah, I’ll be alright’. Then all of a sudden: ‘Wow this is a bit tricky’. All of a sudden: ‘Wow my confidence is low’. Then all of a sudden: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing, I can’t find my way’. <b>[It’s about]</b> trying to speed them up through that process and come out the other end positively and ready to go and used to what we do. <b>[Defour]</b> is a top player for Burnley but it still took six months of in and out, in and out to get used to it and really do well. Slowly but surely the brain and the body adapt. The Premier League is a different thing. Most of the European managers I know and the ones I speak to, that’s been the thing that shocks them. It’s faster, harder, no one gives an inch, no one bows down. We can’t spend £30m on two European players that then take eight months to get involved in what we do. The big clubs can. They carry those players for an amount of time which gives them time to come through it. When they’ve got it they thrive and become top players. Finding time to get the adjustment period and win enough games to be in the Premier League, that’s the tricky bit. Add in language barrier, cultural shift, fitness levels, we can do one, maybe two, possibly three, but we couldn’t do seven at a time. They wouldn’t all get it at the same rate.<br /><br />It’s alright having a list but your first, second, third, fourth, fifth choice are suddenly gone then your sixth, seventh and eighth, well they’re gone as well because we are not market leaders financially. There are certain players you know immediately, the wages and fees are too high. But then you narrow down which ones you can get. Even them we lose out on because someone will pay them more money. People go: ‘We’ve put x amount of pounds on this player and that’s what we want, end of story’. That’s made it more challenging. Players that have played one year in the Championship, £15m. It makes it tough. This club has to be balanced. It has to have a balanced view of what it’s doing. No debt, record profits, £10m net spend in four windows, low wage bill. If you add all that in, and then still got to play the beautiful game apparently, it’s not that easy. And win of course!</p>

Strangely, after a bad day for us, a bad result that’s for sure, the next day, with eight-odd million people in London, I bump into <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>! That was a strange moment for him and me. But we were both correct because he said they were very good, which they were, and I said we weren’t, so we were both right. Anyway, it was just a life moment, that I thought was quite interesting.<br /><br />I spoke to him more than I have before, ever. We had a good 10 minutes, and he was very polite, very kind to my family. It was an interesting moment in a city of eight-odd million people. I was on my way to Poundstretchers by the way - he was on his way to Harrods!<br /><br />His face was actually more shocked than mine, because he was plodding along and I saw him with his hat on, and he shot his head up and said a bad word, and then said, ‘Sorry, your wife and children are there!’. But he was very pleasant - as he would be after smashing us the day before. But we had six or seven minutes chatting about how he’s settling, life in general, that sort of stuff. But he was very pleasant.</p>

I have a big respect for him and I like him as a player. He just hasn’t had the pitch time. He has been a credit to himself with his professionalism, apart from the incident. He has looked after himself and tried to be part of the group. He has just not had the game time that he needs. There was an incident that was unfortunate and cost a lot more time than we thought. My respect for him as high as a person and a player. It does heighten the need <b>[for a replacement]</b> but you have to have the players available, finance and all the things that align. It is even tougher in a window that is <b>[already]</b> tough. There are only so many targets that fit our model. There is nothing that is looking open to us</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> boss Dyche admits sale of Dwight McNeil could happen]</b> There’s a reality when players come in, particularly when we’ve developed them as lower-league players for less money or the likes of Dwight McNeil. At some point those players, not all of them, but some of them get to a point where the club will sell them. Just by the natural economics they’re going to go ‘well, OK, what did we bring that player in for and what’s the offer?’. The difference is that offer is now stretched because we don’t actually need the money. In the past, we always had to do certain things. Now we don’t have to do them because we’re in a very strong financial position. Keano went and it was a case of we can’t refuse that money. Now we can. That’s the difference, although the basic principle is still there. If a player does so, so well and enough big interest comes from the top of the market, the chances are at some point that situation breaks and that player goes<br /><br />It’s part of the reality of the club, we’re not giants in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We can’t pay the wages that other clubs pay and some of the numbers that these players get are astronomical. They’re miles above what we can pay. When that moment comes, I have to factor that in a little bit as well and say ‘look, this is a chance for them to go and get whatever that may be and we can’t compete with that’. The business comes first, of course, but there’s also a bit of moral fibre there and we can’t stop a player from having that opportunity. But I can assure you it will only happen if the numbers are correct. The numbers now in our world are high and we’re in a position to say no, we don’t need to sell anyone. So if anyone wants to come for any of our players, they had better have a war chest</p>

  <p><b>[Sean Dyche exclusive: Inside life in the transfer market at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>]</b> Trust me, if you ring a League Two club for a player, you think they’ll say: ‘Ah, we want about £100k for him.’ They don’t. They say: ‘We want £17m!’ There’s no rhyme or reason in the market now, you either pay it, or you don’t<br /><br />If you want to really, really jump, you’ve got to be looking at the £25m mark. I don’t think this club will do that. So, therefore, we are always in this lower bracket anyway<br /><br />As a club that doesn’t want to put money out there and hope, we have to try and make the signings that are edging towards ‘these are going to work,’ rather than a ‘right let’s just wait and see if he works, we’ll just take them anyway,’ which some clubs do. They go on a 50/50 risk with signings, whereas we’ve got to try and make it 70/30 in our favour. So that’s where it gets tricky and difficult<br /><br />I think it’s an enjoyable challenge because it’s something I believe in, and always have done. When I first went into coaching with the <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> Under-18s, my main aim was to give them more than I had received in my career. I thought if I could give them more, and they develop, that is the key. And I strongly believe that as a manager now. Of course you’ve got to get results, but if you can do that in a way that the players are benefiting, growing, maturing, you’re raising your chances of winning again anyway.<br /><br />I always believe that if you affect the person, you affect their performance. Regardless of their background, wherever they are from, old or young, that’s still the key: ‘Can I affect the person in a manner that improves their performance?’. It’s good that I believe in it because we’ve had to do it! It’s rare that we go out and spend big money, so it has become part of what we do. But it does become more difficult, because you can’t get these players. Even the ones we have developed, how quickly can you get them to be effective? Because a lot of them actually haven’t played <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football<br /><br />That’s with the chairman at the moment. I’ve offered what we think is appropriate, and so has Mike Rigg and the powers that be in the club, and eventually it does come down to the chairman at some point, because he has to give it the sign-off for getting it done. There are situations, but we’ll wait and see<br /><br />I think the early signs of this lockdown are that the big superpowers are still going to be spending a lot of money. It suggests there’s money out there to be spent. Whether or not is softens slightly, we’ll see. In our world, our markets are not the main market. We don’t always sign other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players, or big players from Europe, with financial reasons being the first one. There may possibly be a softening in the Championship and below. We’re going to have to wait and see, but we often have to wait and see anyway! It’s very rare that we say: ‘Here’s a big fat cheque, we want your player!’ so it’s often the waiting game.<br /><br />It will certainly be up there as an achievement, because the last time we finished seventh we didn’t have all of these challenges. We had a fully fit squad, and we were going well.<br /><br />The daily issue is getting players fit, and the weekly one is the same! Getting players fit and out there. I wait for the physio to come in, with that look, and you give him that look back, almost like a horror film where you have your head behind the cushion, and you think: ‘I hope he’s going to give me good news!</p>

  <p><b>[Dyche admitted he is having to juggle the demands of getting through the remainder of the season while nursing injuries]</b> I think Jack is going to need minor surgery it looks like - I will find out more today - and Ben Mee we’ve got it scanned, we know what it is, it’s just now settling it down and getting it going again. With such a short period now for the games, it is unlikely them two are going to make up the games. With Corky and Ben I am not envisaging at this moment that it rolls into next season, I think they will be fit and well.<br /><br />It is one of them unfortunate things, let’s face it it could have come at a time when we weren’t in the shape we are in. You can quickly forget we are at 46 points, our second-highest total we have ever had in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We have achieved that so far with these challenges. If these challenges would have come before we had a good run of seven without defeat then things could have been different. These injuries and different challenges have come at a time when we have got good points on the table so there is a balance to the situation. Forty-six points at this stage is no mean feat for clubs like ourselves.</p>

If it was a randomly, bizarrely hot day then that’s fair obviously<br /><br />We don’t want any trouble and hydration is a massive thing in sport of all kinds. It’s a bit over-egged for me. Trust me, I’m looking out of the window in my office and it’s about 13 degrees and shelling it down. I don’t really think you will be needing a drinks break to be honest but c’est la vie<br /><br />Well the idea was for the drinks break, it is actually a drinks break but we have seen that it’s like a tactical break all of a sudden. I think everyone is just trying to get on with it. Like I say, I’m not too fussed with it all. Different people are trying to use it in different ways, but I think the intention was just to get some drinks down people and then get on with it<br /><br />You can get the message onto the pitch much easier with no one in the stadium anyway. I don’t necessarily think that’s relevant to just use a line that the drinks break is like that, because you can easily get information on now without the fans in the stadium</p>

There is a demand on that. So I think I’m slightly more open-minded about that and where we can take it from now on in.

So, that’s very pleasing with games left to go, so it is that balance though. I just think if we had the full complement of players where we could make the changes, and more of them when needed, even if during a game. Then I’d like to think we could challenge for our highest total level. I’m not saying we can’t. I just think it’s slightly more tricky.</p>

  <p><b>[Dyche says it is another example of a rule change helping the elite and hindering smaller clubs like <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>]</b> I think it quite obviously favours the big clubs because they can keep more players happy and more players involved by making more changes. A lot of football often does. We all had to change the size of our home pitches to make sure they aligned with the big clubs who were in Europe. We all had to cut the grass the same length. So most things are pushed forward by the big clubs in the division. But equally the big clubs are part of what sells the division to the world. They are fantastic clubs in their own right, they have got amazing histories and a lot of prowess in football. It could be a slightly calmer situation for managers <b>[of bigger clubs]</b> with players who get slightly disgruntled than if they’re out of the team and out of the squad. We will look to deliver first, and if you can deliver a performance you often get the outcome you want. Having been through that <b>[relegation]</b> I still think there will be a pride and passion from them towards the game. We’ve got to safeguard against that by being ready to deliver another performance. So I think we go there open-minded, as we have done with all these games after lockdown. We’ve got to remind the players that is going to be needed. We don’t take anyone in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> lightly, nor should we, because it is so tough going around winning games. We’ve had that unfortunate experience like <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>. We went down the first time we came up and I think we finished win, draw, win. I know it sounds crazy but the pressure release is off. It’s done now and weirdly that opens people up a little bit</p>
