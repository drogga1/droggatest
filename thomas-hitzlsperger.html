  <p><b>[Thomas Hitzlsperger on his homosexuality]</b> I am speaking up about my homosexuality because I want to get the discussion about homosexuality among athletes going. It was a long and difficult process to realise that I am homosexual. Only in the past few years did I reach the conclusion that I prefer living with another man. Homosexuality is not a serious issue in England, Germany and Italy – at least not in the dressing room. I have never felt ashamed that I am homosexual</p>

  <p><b>[Hitzlsperger says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs time and money]</b> Now you see, that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is very close together. I think they have the chance to qualify for the Champions League. They are no contender for the title this season, maybe next year. They are ready to invest a lot of money. If they trust their manager, which they do, they will give him a lot of money to spend and the title is possible.<br /><br /><b>[Hitzlsperger said he was unsurprised by how <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> had been received after his appointment was confirmed]</b> It’s crazy what is happening there since his arrival, because the Englishmen loved the way <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> played under him. When I still played in England, they often asked me about him and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I recognised that his enthusiasm and his charisma are things people love. He is definitely a charismatic character</p>

  <p><b>[Stuttgart appoint Thomas Hitzlsperger as sporting director]</b> Following the end of my playing career, I’ve spent the past two-and-a-half-years gaining management experience and making valuable contacts. Now, in my new role as sporting director, I will be putting all my efforts into keeping VfB <b>[Stuttgart]</b> in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and ensuring this talented team has a successful future. I thank our president and the supervisory board for the faith they’ve placed in me and I’m very much looking forward to this great challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Ozan Kabak - Bundesliga’s Rookie of the Year who idolises Van Dijk]</b> It’s incredible how worldly-wise he is for his age. It’s astonishing. I see him every day and am amazed at how mature he is. He wants to know everything; he wants to learn German right away and understand everything. That’s the kind of attitude we need. He’s already a role model, despite his age.</p>
