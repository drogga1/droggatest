  <p><b>[Leeds United have taken the unusual step of announcing that they will take in a post-season tour of war-torn Myanmar]</b> Myanmar is one of the fastest growing nations in South East Asia and is passionate about English football. They have ambitious goals for grassroots and elite football development that we are delighted to be able to support. This tour gives us an opportunity to meet new fans of football who will hopefully support our journey back to the Premier League in the coming years.</p>

This match will be a fantastic part of our centenary season and we expect between 4000 to 5000 of our passionate supporters from all over the world to travel to Sydney and we look forward to seeing them all there.</p>

  <p><b>[Angus Kinnear reveals how they brought <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> to <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a>]</b> It was really the brainchild of our director of football, Victor Orta. He was asked by our owner, Andrea Radrizzani: ‘If you could appoint anybody in the world, who would you appoint?’. When he said the name, I have to say I smiled to myself - but our owner is nothing if not lacking ambition. When we went to Buenos Aires to speak to <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>, I thought we were going to have to do a really big sell in terms of the potential, the project and what <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> could become and the part he could play. But, in fact, he’d done his research and he was already committed to the cause. We actually spent the 24 hours in Buenos Aires just talking about the players and the systems and how he wanted to play. I left knowing he was going to be the manager of <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> but not actually having the contract that I went over with to get signed</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> chief predicts ‘national embarrassment’ if English season is abandoned due to coronavirus]</b> England had some of the finest sports scientists and football administrators in the game and the time has come for us as a sport to stop repeatedly framing the challenges and start delivering on the solution. It would be a national embarrassment if the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> or <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> were to be able to complete safely and the first and fifth-biggest leagues in the world were not able to follow suit if the context remained comparable<br /><br />However, our intention has always been to do all we can to complete this season where we started it - on the pitch<br /><br />Across the leagues hundreds of players will have to make the same decision and whilst individual choices and circumstance need to be respected they cannot be allowed to derail the personal judgements of the majority and the health of our national games as a whole</p>

  <p><b>[Angus Kinnear says <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> targeting Champions League after <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return]</b> Whilst we’re celebrating, whilst we’re all very excited, we’ve got back to where we belong. This really is base camp for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> shouldn’t be a Championship side, they should be a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side, so really the challenge starts now and it’s about competing in <a href="epl.html">the EPL</a>. Now it’s going to be really about building on that and making sure that over the next few years we start to compete at the level <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> should be competing in, which ultimately is the top six, and that’s always been our aim. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> should have a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team. Candidly, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> should have a Champions League team and that’s the vision<br /><br /><b>[Kinnear admits that the shortened window is a bigger challenge for promoted sides]</b> We know we need to strengthen. Targets have been identified. We’re working on them already, we’re working on them now - today it’s started in earnest. And (we know) that recruitment is going to be the biggest challenge because the window is so short. If you look at our business model, the size of our fanbase means that we can generate commercial revenues in the top third of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> teams. With the TV money being fairly evenly spread other than the performance related element, it means we immediately have a competitive advantage if we can harness that fanbase and use those resources to compete in the transfer market. I think next year the team will go out every week and play swashbuckling, attacking football, will show absolutely no fear, will show no team any respect. We’re not going to be scared and I think we’ll give <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> supporters another year they can be proud of</p>
