  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">FC Celtic</a> vs FK Sarajevo. One man eager to return to action is Ryan Christie, who missed the end of last term due to a facial injury]</b> We were delighted with how it went out there. The tie’s definitely not over, so we need to be on top of our game to make sure we get ourselves over the line. It’s the first European game at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> Park this season and hopefully there’s many more if we can progress though the rounds</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about the Hoops’ title chase after the game]</b> Over the last couple of years, that’s what has helped us drive towards the finishing line - that mentality of one game at a time. We knew it was a big game <b>[against Hamilton]</b> and we were desperate to get the three points. But there are so many games to go that we need to keep churning out victories, hopefully, and see how far it takes us<br /><br />It felt amazing to get back out there. I’ve been itching to get back in about it. The boys have been doing so well up until now but it was nice to come on and help to get a victory. That’s my job, that’s what I’ve got to do. Especially in games like that one when it’s a bit stuffy at 1-1. You have to come off the bench and try to do something. To be fair, Jonny Hayes came off the bench and did very well as did Tom Rogic. That’s what we aim to do, that’s what the gaffer wants us to do. When we do it, we’re happy</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> star midfielder Ryan Christie reckons Ireland have pulled off a masterstroke by adding <a href="damien-duff.html">Damien Duff</a> to the backroom staff]</b> Duffers is a quality coach and his training is brilliant. He brings that energy with him every day.<br /><br />It’s no surprise to me that he has been added to the Republic of Ireland coaching staff. Just being around him and listening to his stories, you realise what a massive career he had at club and international level. We all know he played at an elite level and it’s been invaluable to have someone like him to learn from<br /><br />I remember watching Duffers play for Ireland. The game that stands out is the World Cup qualifier against France, when <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> handled the ball before scoring. I can also recall him playing in that successful <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team, even though I was a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan. Duffers played alongside some world-class players and his stories are brilliant. When he’s giving advice, everyone listens because he played at the very highest level.<br /><br />Duffers is also very clear in getting his point across and we all understand what he wants.<br /><br /><b>[Christie is trying to stay occupied during the football lockdown and admits he finds an Oasis of calm through his acoustic guitar]</b> I actually started learning when I was on loan at Aberdeen a couple of years ago</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> midfielder Ryan Christie believes the club’s pre-season trip to France will provide the perfect preparation for their attempt to make history with a tenth successive Scottish Premiership title]</b> These games are definitely going to be tough. But that’s the level we see ourselves as a club and a team so these games will be great for us. It’s good to test yourself against the best at every chance you get. The friendlies will be the first proper games for us and we’ll take a lot out of those games. We’re not going in against a lower league team or anything like that. The opposition we’ll be facing are of a very high level and that’ll definitely help get us back into match fitness quicker<br /><br /><b>[Christie insists motivation, as ever, will not be a problem for the champions]</b> We have a massive motivation within the squad. Since I’ve been here, that’s been constant and we rarely look at any other factors outside of what we can do ourselves. The only thing we can really influence is our performances and the results. As long as we take care of that, then everything else will be out of our control.</p>
