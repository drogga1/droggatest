  <p><b>[Alex Teixeira has admitted he would have preferred a move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after completing his €50million switch from Shakhtar Donetsk to Jiangsu Suning]</b> Everyone always knew that I wanted to stay in Europe and move to an <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> club. I wanted to make it to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> one day. But, unfortunately, all the proposals that came from them were somewhat unsubstantial and did not contain anything concrete. I received a serious offer from China, so of course I took it. I discussed it with my family and the people that are close to me. I consulted with my wife the most and she supported my decision. Despite the fact that it all took place at a lightning speed, I would not say that it was an easy decision. I just had to respond quickly. But leaving the people with whom I have worked for so many years and who helped me grow, with whom I made friends is, of course, difficult</p>
