  <p><b>[Alexander Isak has completed a €10 million (£8.9m/$11.3m) move from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> to <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>]</b> I am very happy to be here, it has been a very good year and finishing it by signing for Real is very good for me. I really want to start, I’ve heard a lot about the club, I know it’s a young team. I thank you for believing in me and I hope that together we can achieve the objectives. I am a player who likes to have the ball, with good technique and who works hard for the team. I think I can help by scoring goals and I hope we do well</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander Isak praises former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> team-mates as he forges own path at <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>]</b> We all played together for a while and they are good friends. Unfortunately, I didn’t play so much at the time, but those two are good players and they’re doing big things. Of course, I’m following them. We all went separate ways in the end, but I enjoy seeing them play week in and week out<br /><br /><b>[Given his large frame and his rise through the Allsvenskan, Isak earned comparisons to Ibrahimovic]</b> That comparison has been given a lot and it’s nothing I think about too much. I have my own style of play and I want to be my own player and not be compared too much. It doesn’t disturb me. Myself, I don’t compare myself to no one. I’m my own player<br /><br />As footballers, we have pressure every day. That’s the way it’s supposed to be when you play in big leagues. I don’t feel pressure from that kind of stuff, being compared to someone like that. I just want to be myself. I don’t feel that type of pressure. I’ve never spoken to <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>, but it would be nice to do it someday<br /><br /><b>[Isak is confident that a more consistent role will come as he looks to reach the levels of his former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> team-mates]</b> I felt like this was the best option for me and the club showed the most interest in buying me. That’s why I came here. You have a lot of young players. It’s one of the youngest average teams in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and that’s so important that the club plays us and allows us to develop. It’s important<br /><br />I’m here and that’s my biggest focus. I’ve been here for just a few months so there isn’t any point in looking at something else. I’m feeling very good here, so I’m excited for my future here right now</p>

  <p><b>[Isak says more needs to be done to fight racism following incident in Romania]</b> Honestly, I don’t know what the solution can be. I think there’s a responsibility to punish people who do stuff like that. I think there should be serious consequences for that stuff. Something has to happen. I’m not in charge, but it’s not for me to say, but I hope something happens. I think that <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> should be a lot harder with punishments, but also it’s not only about getting it away from stadiums. It shouldn’t be in this world. The problem is big, and it’s not easy to solve<br /><br />For me, it’s important to focus on what’s important to me. I do what I love. If someone tries to distract me from that, you just have to try and block it out. It’s not something that should happen, but I’m pretty strong and can handle it</p>

  <p><b>[Sweden striker Isak subjected to incredibly sad racist abuse in Romania]</b> Of course it is sad for the moment, but at the same time we were prepared for such things to happen, even if it does not help in that way. I think I could handle it well and the team’s support was incredible too. We did well and it is incredibly sad that such things happen, but what should we do?</p>
