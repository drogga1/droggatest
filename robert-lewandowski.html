  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski on how a four legged friend helped him to success]</b> I dribbled and played against him as a child. My dog was a boxer and was always trying to get the ball off me. It was fun. Even when he nicked it from me, he would give it back and keep playing. When I had to do training runs, I would do it with my dog. After an injury early in my career, I noticed that I got tired quickly doing these runs, but I managed to get back in shape after a while. Once the dog struggled to keep up with me, I knew I was back in form.</p>

They are legends, of course their departure is sad. But Bayern will also sign more and better replacements. I believe that the winger Bayern will sign in the future will be as good as Robben and Ribery.<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski insists they need to recruit to hold off Borussia Dortmund, who finished two points back in second place last term]</b> In order to have a good performance next season and to overcome Dortmund, I hope that Bayern can do something in the transfer market this summer<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski is unconcerned by their failures though]</b> The Bundesliga clubs’ bad performances in the Champions League this season is just an accidental phenomenon.

To play at that top level, you need certain qualities and a strong team to be competitive. We haven’t really done a big transfer in the past two years. We need new signings. Everyone knows it’s not optimal that we have so few players in the first team right now. We need more players for the competition in training. I hope something will happen in the next few days<br /><br /><b>[On recruits Lucas Hernandez and Pavard]</b> Players like Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard can only help us. They are versatile, both world champions and ready to play at the top level at Bayern and we can be successful with them<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski replied when asked about negotiations]</b> We are in talks. I don’t know how long it will take but we are on the right track. I feel really well, not only with the team but I also love the city. It doesn’t only depend on me, there’s other factors. We still have to finish our negotiations. It’s a little too early to say I want to end my career in 2023. If I get this extension, I would like to play longer of course. I still feel young.

It’s not enough for me; I find those games difficult<br /><br />Sometimes you have to be there waiting for the ball and if you get it once in the 90 minutes you have to be ready. But I say: ‘I want to be part of the team, of the game, I want to move and pass and not just wait for the ball’. That’s why I am always looking for space to get the ball and find my teammates. I can work on everything still. But one thing? Maybe to shoot from distance</p>

  <p><b>[Lewandowksi hails former coaches’ motivational techniques]</b> At <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> we bet that if I score 10 goals <b>[in training]</b> then <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> gives me €50. The first training sessions, I score three or four. Then after five, six, seven sessions I score seven, eight. Then after three months I score every training more like 10.<br /><br />After a few weeks Jurgen said: ‘No more, it’s too much for me. I don’t want to pay you any more.’ That was part of my mentality. That was very helpful for me. And good in another way. Before I had a lot of problems with my body language - being more a part of the game and training. My body language was the same. Sometimes you have to be more angry. For me that was never going to happen.<br /><br />I had to change. That was under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He told me sometimes he didn’t know if I was angry or happy. Nobody likes changing something in yourself. That was not easy. But I knew if I wanted to be a better player and move to the next step in my career I had to start. He is an amazing guy. It doesn’t matter what he says: you believe him. Everything is from the heart<br /><br />I learned a lot from <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. We spoke a lot about tactics and for me that was something new. I knew that if I could play for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> with his mind and his ideas - about tactics, about strikers - that it would be good for me. In modern football it’s very difficult to play without a striker. I’ve not seen that for a few years.<br /><br />They <b>[Guardiola and Klopp]</b> are different trainers but if you make a mix from both it would be perfection</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski weighed in on the reports linking <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> to Bayern Munich]</b> There is a lot of speculation. I can only say that he is a great player with great skills who can harmonise very well with his team-mates. Not just in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or the Champions League, we’ve already seen what he could do at Schalke. He could certainly help us find new solutions in our game.<br /><br /><b>[Flick has since earned the job on a permanent basis]</b> It is great news for us. In the past few months we have all seen how well it fits with him. With him, everyone is going in the same direction, cooperation and communication. We have a lot of trust in him. It is very important and I am happy about it. Hopefully we will win many titles together.<br /><br /><b>[As a fellow striker, Lewandowski is excited to get back to work with <a href="miroslav-klose.html">Klose</a> involved]</b> I know Miro. He was a great player and I know that he can help us with his experience and skills. You can learn something new from every coach to be a better player. I want that from him too</p>

  <p><b>[Lewandowski said, when quizzed on <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> who has netted 12 times in 11 appearances for Dortmund]</b> He has huge potential, but still has time. I don’t want to put any pressure on him with my statements. If he works hard, he can become a better player and eventually reach the top level.

  <p><b>[Bayern’s Lewandowski targets playing career well beyond 35 years old]</b> I was at the award ceremony last December. We’ll see. What I try to do is to always show the best of myself, win trophies and score more goals. But that’s something that comes with collective trophies. That’s the most important thing. I don’t even think about the Ballon d’Or, even if, in my life, I believe that anything is possible. I am not yet in the best period of my career. Soon (I’ll be). But all of these are just numbers. I am confident that the best moment of my career will come quickly. I know this is not my last contract. I want to play longer and stay in shape. I have all the time in front of me to think about the future, but I feel really good. I’m going to celebrate my 32th birthday next August, but that doesn’t mean that I feel this age. For me, it doesn’t matter in terms of everything I do, my involvement in and outside of football. What I want is not just staying on top for the next two or three years, I’m looking at the longer term<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski puts his spectacular form down to a careful regimen of diet and training to keep mentally and physically sharp]</b> I don’t eat meat on the day of a match. It’s too heavy for my body. I eat light - that’s what I need. The meal depends on several things: when is the game, what time is it <b>[…]</b> If you eat rice or pasta, it will bring you big benefits in terms of energy in the very short term. But, over time, you gain nothing. It’s not easy <b>[to score]</b> especially when you are tired. With 90 per cent of goals, it’s the head that does the work and it’s influenced by your level of concentration. If you’re tired, your thinking will automatically be slower. In the penalty area, we have only 0.1 seconds, maybe 0.2, to think, make our decision and interact with the ball. That’s why we come to training, because there is no other place to build automatic movements and shots. Whether it’s left foot, right foot, whatever, you have to be ready. You don’t even have to think about it - you have to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski wants to see even more from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in the Champions League after sealing another <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> title]</b> We are German champions. Of course it is a bit complicated without celebrating fans. That certain extra, this passion is missing. We are still very satisfied. It was not an easy season, we fought for the title for a long time. I hope that we can celebrate with the fans in the stadium soon. Werder played a little more defensively but well in the first half. In the second half we should have scored a goal, then it would have been a little easier. We showed that we are the best team in Germany and we want to play even better in the Champions League<br /><br />We had to fight hard, but that describes a bit the situation of the last few weeks. We stayed with it. The fighting spirit, regardless of the quality, is enormous. With this comeback that we started and the way we played in the second half of the season, I have rarely had so many emotional moments in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> matches, whether at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> <b>[a 1-0 win last month]</b> or today. When I look at the boys, we achieved this common goal and it is one that we achieved with pride.
s<br /><br />We will devote ourselves to the evening in compliance with the rules and let the emotions run wild for the time being. During the coronavirus period, everyone has to have a single table, but we will not necessarily give up. You can still lift a glass two metres away with a little distance</p>
