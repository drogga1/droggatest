  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski insists Poland earned their place at Euro 2016 after their decisive 2-1 victory against the Republic of Ireland]</b> We deserved to qualify. We were better than Ireland. There are small details which can improve our game. But this bodes well for the future. I believed in these guys. Our goal was always to progress to France in these qualifiers. We deserved an automatic place, not the play-offs. I’d like to thank all the fans who believed in us from the very beginning. We felt their support, whether we played in Warsaw or abroad.</p>

It was fun. Even when he nicked it from me, he would give it back and keep playing. When I had to do training runs, I would do it with my dog. After an injury early in my career, I noticed that I got tired quickly doing these runs, but I managed to get back in shape after a while. Once the dog struggled to keep up with me, I knew I was back in form.</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski believes a poor refereeing display during Bayern Munich’s Champions League meeting with Real Madrid on Tuesday made it impossible for the Bundesliga side to progress into the semi-final]</b> In the game today I think we could have won and played the next round but the referee made a lot of errors. I think it was impossible to play Real Madrid with 10 men<br /><br />It was not a red card, and for their goals it was offside for one, maybe two. Also, for my situation as well, when I was one-on-one, I was not offside either. It’s very difficult to play against Madrid at the Bernabeu if you have a situation like today.<br /><br />Yes <b>[it’s frustrating]</b> because when you know you are so close to playing in the next round, but it is not your decision that is happening on the pitch. After one one decision they scored a goal and one was offside. It’s very difficult because you can fight and play well but sometimes it’s impossible to win or play in the next round. Of course, after the 90 minutes we had won the game 2-1 and had a good chance but with 10 men for 30 minutes it’s very difficult to play Real Madrid and that’s why we are not in the next round<br /><br />He <b>[Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> is a fantastic player, of course. We know that. Maybe he’s not a striker like me</p>

If I was to think about this speculation as a Bayern player, it would not be good for me because I would not be focused on my job here. I’m a Bayern player and I want to give everything here first. It’s sometimes more difficult for a centre-forward because he often stands with his back to the goal, holding the ball, watching what can happen. Turning around with it’s easier, when you have everything in front of you<br /><br />It would not be a sensation if Bayern won the Champions League. But it might get harder in the future when you see what’s going on in the other leagues. The Bundesliga must be careful that it retains four qualifying positions. It would be good if next to Bayern and Dortmund, a third team would be constantly represented in the Champions League</p>

The power structures in football have changed massively in recent years. If a player really wants to change clubs he can usually push that through.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has explained that his goal against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday owes much to watching ice hockey players]</b> I know this trick from the scorers in ice hockey. I’ve done it three or four times, getting a slight deflection to score. You need good timing, a good attitude and a good position. It makes it much more difficult for the opponents and especially the goalkeeper, a slight touch came make the difference for a goal. Jonathan Tah was right behind me and if I hadn’t touched the ball, he would have cleared it. Javi said afterwards that it was good I deflected the ball slightly.</p>

I have a plan to play at the top level at least until I’m 35.<br /><br />You do it because you have to repeat everything time and time again. Then I add things. At the moment I am trying to improve my long-distance shooting with my left foot. I have to reach a point with that where my head doesn’t have to think - I just react - and that helps me to make quick decisions. It’s called the automatics. To do something because you just know how to do it. There is no wasting time on thinking. In football you don’t learn everything at the same time. You have to work on yourself all the time<br /><br />I want to have my own good memories. But to reaped what they did would be a dream come true and I want to rewrite history. It has cost me a lot to be where I am and I didn’t get anything for free. I didn’t do too much talking either, I prefer to act. Maybe, as a team, we can do something special in Russia</p>

I always stand behind my team-mates and the coach, and say nothing negative about my team-mates. We had a lot of injury problems before the World Cup and many of our players did not play regularly because of problems at their club. That is the reason for our elimination.

Neither of the club bosses defended me. I did not feel good in Munich at that moment. Being at Bayern did not fit for me at that time.<br /><br />I noticed that in Munich the fans support me.

I wanted to make a statement by saying: ‘If there are so many people who are not satisfied with me, I might as well leave’. Still I knew that Bayern’s answer would be: No, no and no. No matter what kind of offer was made<br /><br />I can’t say I am disappointed. I am still at one of the best clubs in the world. Maybe Bayern’s popularity worldwide is a little lower than with other top clubs, but if I was not happy here I’d have a problem. I will still fight for the biggest goals.

After every single training session I stayed on the pitch and practised with my left foot, my right foot and being systematic and repeating the movements was very important. It did not matter what I did with the team, I knew I had to stay after training to do things for myself. Sometimes I did it without a goalkeeper, who might have been tired or not have time for me, because I would stay on for two extra hours. I remember the first six months at Dortmund, the training was very hard under Jurgen Klopp. I was very young and wanted to show everyone I could give 110% in every training session. After two or three months, I was very tired and could not show all my skills. It was too much for me and I needed three months lighter training to get back to form. When I think about it now, I learned a lot. After the first few months my body was ready to work harder. Around November I scored a lot of goals and my team-mates said ‘Robert is back’, and I knew then I could show all my skills</p>

When we spoke about it and I heard this for the first time, it really meant a lot to me. I have to be thankful to him because of what we achieved together at Borussia Dortmund. We grew together, and it’s led me to where I am today<br /><br />In the Champions League at a stage where you only have two games, fear is always in the back of your mind. We will play very offensively but both teams have strong defences so it won’t be easy to create many chances.

Kingsley Coman is also great, he has huge potential and can become a great player, he is so fast with the ball. Tolisso is injured but he has always played well with us. Pavard, I have already played against him, he is a very good player. For him, it will be a new stage in his career, it is a good transfer for Bayern. Hernandez, I know him too. Before there were a lot of Spanish players, now I’m going to have to learn French<br /><br />I do everything to be the best number nine in the world, but I do not think of whether I am the number one striker or not. Every time I am on the field I have to prove myself. It’s great if I score and the team wins. I’m very happy with my career, I play in one of the best clubs in the world</p>

But I say: ‘I want to be part of the team, of the game, I want to move and pass and not just wait for the ball’. That’s why I am always looking for space to get the ball and find my teammates. I can work on everything still. But one thing? Maybe to shoot from distance</p>

  <p><b>[Lewandowksi hails former coaches’ motivational techniques]</b> At <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> we bet that if I score 10 goals <b>[in training]</b> then <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> gives me €50. The first training sessions, I score three or four. Then after five, six, seven sessions I score seven, eight. Then after three months I score every training more like 10.<br /><br />After a few weeks Jurgen said: ‘No more, it’s too much for me. I don’t want to pay you any more.’ That was part of my mentality. That was very helpful for me. And good in another way. Before I had a lot of problems with my body language - being more a part of the game and training. My body language was the same. Sometimes you have to be more angry. For me that was never going to happen.<br /><br />I had to change. That was under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He told me sometimes he didn’t know if I was angry or happy. Nobody likes changing something in yourself. That was not easy. But I knew if I wanted to be a better player and move to the next step in my career I had to start. He is an amazing guy. It doesn’t matter what he says: you believe him. Everything is from the heart<br /><br />I learned a lot from <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. We spoke a lot about tactics and for me that was something new. I knew that if I could play for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> with his mind and his ideas - about tactics, about strikers - that it would be good for me. In modern football it’s very difficult to play without a striker. I’ve not seen that for a few years.<br /><br />They <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> are different trainers but if you make a mix from both it would be perfection</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski weighed in on the reports linking <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> There is a lot of speculation. I can only say that he is a great player with great skills who can harmonise very well with his team-mates. Not just in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or the Champions League, we’ve already seen what he could do at Schalke. He could certainly help us find new solutions in our game.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> has since earned the job on a permanent basis]</b> It is great news for us. In the past few months we have all seen how well it fits with him. With him, everyone is going in the same direction, cooperation and communication. We have a lot of trust in him. It is very important and I am happy about it. Hopefully we will win many titles together.<br /><br /><b>[As a fellow striker, Lewandowski is excited to get back to work with <a href="miroslav-klose.html">Klose</a> involved]</b> I know Miro. He was a great player and I know that he can help us with his experience and skills. You can learn something new from every coach to be a better player. I want that from him too</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s Lewandowski targets playing career well beyond 35 years old]</b> I was at the award ceremony last December. We’ll see. What I try to do is to always show the best of myself, win trophies and score more goals. But that’s something that comes with collective trophies. That’s the most important thing. I don’t even think about the Ballon d’Or, even if, in my life, I believe that anything is possible. I am not yet in the best period of my career. Soon (I’ll be). But all of these are just numbers. I am confident that the best moment of my career will come quickly. I know this is not my last contract. I want to play longer and stay in shape. I have all the time in front of me to think about the future, but I feel really good. I’m going to celebrate my 32th birthday next August, but that doesn’t mean that I feel this age. For me, it doesn’t matter in terms of everything I do, my involvement in and outside of football. What I want is not just staying on top for the next two or three years, I’m looking at the longer term<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski puts his spectacular form down to a careful regimen of diet and training to keep mentally and physically sharp]</b> I don’t eat meat on the day of a match. It’s too heavy for my body. I eat light - that’s what I need. The meal depends on several things: when is the game, what time is it <b>[…]</b> If you eat rice or pasta, it will bring you big benefits in terms of energy in the very short term. But, over time, you gain nothing. It’s not easy <b>[to score]</b> especially when you are tired. With 90 per cent of goals, it’s the head that does the work and it’s influenced by your level of concentration. If you’re tired, your thinking will automatically be slower. In the penalty area, we have only 0.1 seconds, maybe 0.2, to think, make our decision and interact with the ball. That’s why we come to training, because there is no other place to build automatic movements and shots. Whether it’s left foot, right foot, whatever, you have to be ready. You don’t even have to think about it - you have to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski wants to see even more from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in the Champions League after sealing another <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> title]</b> We are German champions. Of course it is a bit complicated without celebrating fans. That certain extra, this passion is missing. We are still very satisfied. It was not an easy season, we fought for the title for a long time. I hope that we can celebrate with the fans in the stadium soon. Werder played a little more defensively but well in the first half. In the second half we should have scored a goal, then it would have been a little easier. We showed that we are the best team in Germany and we want to play even better in the Champions League<br /><br />We had to fight hard, but that describes a bit the situation of the last few weeks. We stayed with it. The fighting spirit, regardless of the quality, is enormous. With this comeback that we started and the way we played in the second half of the season, I have rarely had so many emotional moments in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> matches, whether at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> <b>[a 1-0 win last month]</b> or today. When I look at the boys, we achieved this common goal and it is one that we achieved with pride.
s<br /><br />We will devote ourselves to the evening in compliance with the rules and let the emotions run wild for the time being. During the coronavirus period, everyone has to have a single table, but we will not necessarily give up. You can still lift a glass two metres away with a little distance</p>
