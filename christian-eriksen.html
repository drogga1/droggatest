  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen says there are exciting times ahead for Tottenham]</b> You can see all the players believe in him <b>[Pochettino]</b> and believe in the club too ­because we are all signing new contracts. Everyone wants to be part of the future of Spurs because we feel there are exciting times ahead. We have a young squad, and that means we can all develop together.<br /><br />I think so, yes. I feel more confident this season in everything we do. We’ve had a few years now getting to the know system the manager wants us to play. He also knows us as players and has been getting his ideas and points across. We are on the right path<br /><br /><b>[On Capital rivals Chelsea]</b> Of course, they have shown they are a very good side so it was important to end their winning run. It showed other teams that Chelsea can be beaten and hopefully it has changed their mentality too. I think we’re in a very good position</p>

Christian just wants to be important for the team, it is the only thing that matters to him.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen believes that his side have dispelled any questions of being reliant on Harry Kane thanks to their 1-0 home win over relegation-threatened Bournemouth]</b> We have a strong enough team to score when Harry doesn’t score. If it is me or Dele Alli, or Son, or Kieran Trippier or Moussa Sissoko or anyone, anyone is good enough to finish. On this occasion the ball fell for me but it was a team performance. No one wants to be called a one-man team, if it is meant seriously. I don’t know if it was. It is a team performance and if you have respect you probably don’t say it. It maybe was a joke but I don’t know.<br /><br />We have shown it in the Premier League - take away some of the games in the Champions League last season where we were not good enough. We have definitely proved we merit being there. We can hopefully have a very nice and hard game at the Bernabeu and show how far we have come from the top-six to a top-three team in the Premier League. Quality and belief, I think, are important. I don’t think we should be scared of anything</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen hailed Tottenham’s character after their Turin comeback against Juventus]</b> Yeah, we don’t care where we are or what time it is, what stadium it is or what team we’re playing, we always try to get the ball forward as quickly as possible and try to create something. After it was 2-0 they dropped a bit, they did start very offensive and then they dropped a bit which gave us a bit more of the ball. It helped us, actually, in a good way.<br /><br />Being 2-0 down after nine minutes there’s only one way and that is trying to come back. First of all we need to go through before we can worry about anyone. But I think we’ve showed that the last few games, we’ve built on everything really and going to a stadium like this… I don’t know if it impressed us, the first nine minutes, but it shocked us. We showed character to come back. We won’t lie down for anyone</p>

Dreams are one thing, but they are only realistic when <b>[an offer]</b> is on the table. Right now, most people are very happy at Tottenham and I am also. All footballers would like to win the Premier League or the Champions League or FA Cup. I think most people just want to win some trophies. You can try to ask Kasper <b>[Schmeichel]</b> how he felt after winning the Premier League. I think it was a good feeling.<br /><br />We have been close to in the last couple of seasons, but in this season we have not been around. Nevertheless, we have still had an absolutely positive season so far. Yes, <b>[I can win trophies with Spurs]</b>. If you think where Tottenham was when I came to where we are now. Now people look at us as title candidates whereas previously we had to fight to get into the top four and even the top six.

We will play the international matches this week, and then we have time after the two international matches to negotiate the entire agreement.<br /><br />We could all be home in our clubs who pay our wages - at home by our wives and children.

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen says he feels fresh as he eases back to full fitness]</b> I feel very good, very fresh. I haven’t played that many games so I think for my body it’s been good with a bit of a build-up going into every game. My body needed it, it said take a rest. It’s never fun to be injured, it’s always boring being on the side, you want to go back to help the team and to be able to play. I’m happy to be back<br /><br />Any coach in football doesn’t like national team games because it’s out of your hands, you can’t really control what’s going to happen. It’s different, but he knows as a player it’s there - he did that as a player as well so he knows how it is. As a player you want to play for your national team, if you’re fit, you play, if you’re not fit, you don’t play. I think everyone is professional enough. Personally, as well, if I’m fit and feel good I will play, it won’t take anything out of that. It’s always a pleasure to be with your national team</p>

You must ask them.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed again on whether he feels under any pressure to put pen to paper]</b> I have not felt like they are going to throw me out yet. It is a business for the club, but that’s not something I’ve been thinking about.<br /><br />If I were to make the decision, I would play every game, whether I could feel something or not. As a football player you would like to play each match. I have felt in my head that I would like to play, but then you listen to your body and accept it might be better that you do not play every game immediately after an injury.

  <p><b>[Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale is one of the best in the world and very, very close to the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He’s a top, top player. Nobody in the world is the same as Messi or Ronaldo, but he’s in a group who are very, very close behind them. He has been playing at Real Madrid for a long time now and he has done very well there. Even to ask the question about how he compares to Messi or Ronaldo shows he is up there. Bale is someone who can always give them something extra. He does it in any team he plays for. He is very quick, very direct, and he is always guaranteed for a few goals. International football is all about getting goals, and he does that.<br /><br />I remember we were watching Wales against Ireland in the first game between them <b>[which Wales won 4-1]</b>, and they were very impressive. Going forward, they are very good. They have young, quick wingers and they are very good in attack. His <b>[Giggs’]</b> mentality is clear, and that has transferred to the team. Wales want to attack and play forward. We know it is like a final on Friday, and Wales have the possibility to win the group if they win the game. We know that, and it will be a fun game to play in front of a full stadium and in a good atmosphere. There will be an extra feeling which will make it different to a friendly game, so that is good. The last time we played Wales was off the back of them beating Ireland very easily. Then they had to come to Denmark, and I think they were tired. This time it will be a very different game</p>

We had a very good first half but everything changed in the second half. We threw it away really.<br /><br />They went to press a bit more, we dropped a bit, played more long balls than we did in the first half and never really got control of what was going on. That’s why we lost compared to the first half. We had a lot of chances and should have finished it off. You can create as many chances as you want but sometimes the opponents create one or two chances and they score. It’s a big blow because we were in control but what could go wrong went wrong in the second half. That leaves a bad feeling. It’s a long wait until the next game, some of us will have internationals but this week it will be tough to get over it. Again, we need to look ahead.

It was a good strike - I had a few before that! I was warmed up to shoot and very pleased it went in. We know these games are very close and very tough. Brighton are a difficult team to play against because they are waiting for us, everyone was in their box so it’s difficult to find any space to play any football and create any big chances. We keep going until the last minute. We had chances and that was the case in the other games as well, games where we should have scored before instead of making it so exciting and nerve-wracking! In the end it’s about taking the chances you get. This was a one-way game and it’s difficult to break through. It was possession from halfway in their half to the goal, they kept their positional plan and we tried to break through.

I hope there will be clarification during the summer. That’s the plan. In football you do not know when clarification will come. It can happen anytime. It would be best for everyone if it happens as soon as possible, but in football things take time.<br /><br />It depends on <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>. And another club has to come in. Or I have to sit down at the table and negotiate a new contract. You can’t set a date yourself. If I have to go, then hopefully it will be a step up. It’s <b>[a potential move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> a step up. But that requires <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to call <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and say they want me. And they have not done so yet, as far as I know. It is hard. It depends on the possibilities. If nothing pops up that is more exciting, why not stay at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>? If I am to sign a new contract it depends on the conditions</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen wishes he could decide just like in Football Manager what happens with his future as he hinted at being frustrated at not being able to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I wish I could decide just like in Football Manager, but unfortunately I can’t<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether his comments were a mistake, given that he now has to stay and fight for more minutes under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> No, it wasn’t. But it is football and you never know what happens in football. Many things always come into play. To me it is not difficult to clear my head. I don’t read much of what is written. And now I have been involved for many years, where there have been many rumours every year. But it’s clear that it’s been a little more fierce this year because my contract is about to expire. I know a lot of people are interested in where I want to play. That’s the way it is. This is how it is in a top club if you have done well. There will always be rumours</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen admits to ‘hardest time’ as exit talk rages and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> form is questioned]</b> It doesn’t matter at all. Everyone is professional and in all clubs there is talk of players going away. That side of the matter has no bearing on how we have performed so far this season. If I, as a football player, took all the rumours to me, I would float on a cloud. But I know that it can’t all be true. It does not affect me what is written<br /><br />It’s definitely my hardest time right now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. The first year when I came was probably a bit up and down, but since <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> came in 2014 it has been a success story. Expectations for us are at a completely different level now. We have to win every time and it’s the same feeling we have as players as well. We as players must try to keep all the negative things completely out. But the reason for our results is actually hard to answer. We can’t close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen is adamant that an expiring contract and ongoing talk of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has nothing to do with the limited game time he has been seeing at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I feel 100 per cent that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> has complete confidence in me. There is not that big a difference, except that I play a little less this year. I don’t feel there is a connection between my contract situation and the fact that I haven’t played as many matches<br /><br />I might take a little more chance than certain other positions on the pitch. Of course there are mistakes, and the decisions taken must also be carried out correctly. They may have been a little bit missing. I’ve been in the right situations. I just haven’t taken the right decisions. It’s a bit about the sharpness that is missing. This is something I have to work on myself<br /><br />The national team is something completely different to a club team. They are two very different things. So the drop I may have got in the club, which is not a big drop, should not matter. But at least I have enough confidence in the bank to be able to play some nice football. So that shouldn’t hamper me</p>

  <p><b>[Eriksen: I was a ‘black sheep’ at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and got the blame for being the ‘bad guy’]</b> I did get the blame for a lot of stuff, for being the bad guy. If you have a short contract, you will be the black sheep. Of course, I did the interview. I was very honest. I felt I had to be honest. I didn’t want to hide like a lot of players do. Everyone is different. I was honest. I wanted to say it out loud. I did get the blame for a lot of stuff, for being the bad guy. I read I was the bad person in the changing room, that ever since I said I wanted to leave, it was no good me being there. To be honest, over the last few years, if anything came up, any player would think about leaving but I was the guy who said it publicly<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was relieved to quiet all the background noise after sealing a switch to Inter]</b> Yes. England, for the last few years, was very hectic. After what I said in the summer, it was just about ‘when is he going to leave?’ Every game it was ‘Is he leaving? Is he not leaving?’ Of course, a lot of people were speaking about it. Even the fans you see on the street were like ‘Thank you, goodbye and good luck’. But I was still there. It was a bit weird.

  <p><b>[Inter midfielder Christian Eriksen has admitted that he held talks with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over a possible transfer]</b> For a few years but it was never really likely. We did speak to them, of course, and we did hear what was possible and what wasn’t possible. But, in the end, me personally, I wanted a new challenge. To stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would have been an easy solution.

In the history of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it was the first time. To be there was so nice and beautiful. But you lose and the next day it is the end of the world. That is how it goes. Afterwards it was difficult. People were still sad from the Champions League final when the season started. After you get a few bad results, then you go into a spiral you are not used to and it was difficult to come back up. But if you look at <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, there is only one team that is really flying. All the others are trying to find their place, not only <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Some seasons are like that. The history of the last five years is of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> being where they have not been before for a long time.

  <p><b>[Ex-Spurs star Eriksen revels in first Milan derby victory]</b> It was a great experience. The first half was sad, but winning like that with a comeback was very, very special. Now I can leave the stadium with a huge smile on my face. The fans had prepared this huge choreography that took up the entire end of the stadium. You don’t get that atmosphere in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, partly because they’re not allowed to. Here, you really feel the fans pushing you on from the moment you arrive in the team bus. They are slapping their hands on the side of the vehicle, you feel their passion and understand how important this match is<br /><br />At the start, I had thought of doing one of the free-kick routines we had studied, putting it into the crowd. But then I saw Milan were defending very deep and we wouldn’t have much of a chance. I looked at <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a>, who told me to go for it, so I did. I really hit it well, but not well enough, seeing as it didn’t go in. Considering the way the game ended, that crossbar is not a nightmare moment, but a satisfying one.

That fires me up, it motivates me, it pushes me in the right direction and helps me to settle in. So far, everything has gone really well</p>
