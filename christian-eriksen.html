Tottenham’s rumoured pursuit of Dani Ceballos has become trickier with the Real Madrid midfielder declaring he does not want to be sold. Ceballos, 22, has been mentioned as a potential makeweight in a deal that could send Christian Eriksen the other way</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen wishes he could decide just like in Football Manager what happens with his future as he hinted at being frustrated at not being able to leave Tottenham]</b> I wish I could decide just like in Football Manager, but unfortunately I can’t<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether his comments were a mistake, given that he now has to stay and fight for more minutes under Mauricio Pochettino]</b> No, it wasn’t. But it is football and you never know what happens in football. Many things always come into play. To me it is not difficult to clear my head. I don’t read much of what is written. And now I have been involved for many years, where there have been many rumours every year. But it’s clear that it’s been a little more fierce this year because my contract is about to expire. I know a lot of people are interested in where I want to play. That’s the way it is. This is how it is in a top club if you have done well. There will always be rumours</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen admits to ‘hardest time’ as exit talk rages and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> form is questioned]</b> It doesn’t matter at all. Everyone is professional and in all clubs there is talk of players going away. That side of the matter has no bearing on how we have performed so far this season. If I, as a football player, took all the rumours to me, I would float on a cloud. But I know that it can’t all be true. It does not affect me what is written<br /><br />It’s definitely my hardest time right now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. The first year when I came was probably a bit up and down, but since <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> came in 2014 it has been a success story. Expectations for us are at a completely different level now. We have to win every time and it’s the same feeling we have as players as well. We as players must try to keep all the negative things completely out. But the reason for our results is actually hard to answer. We can’t close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen is adamant that an expiring contract and ongoing talk of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has nothing to do with the limited game time he has been seeing at Tottenham]</b> I feel 100 per cent that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> has complete confidence in me. There is not that big a difference, except that I play a little less this year. I don’t feel there is a connection between my contract situation and the fact that I haven’t played as many matches<br /><br />I might take a little more chance than certain other positions on the pitch. Of course there are mistakes, and the decisions taken must also be carried out correctly. They may have been a little bit missing. I’ve been in the right situations. I just haven’t taken the right decisions. It’s a bit about the sharpness that is missing. This is something I have to work on myself<br /><br />The national team is something completely different to a club team. They are two very different things. So the drop I may have got in the club, which is not a big drop, should not matter. But at least I have enough confidence in the bank to be able to play some nice football. So that shouldn’t hamper me</p>

  <p><b>[Having learned his trade on the streets of Dublin, Troy Parrott is now training with the world-class talent in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s senior team, impressing the likes of Christian Eriksen]</b> For a player so young, he is a great striker who makes brilliant runs and scores with excellent finishes. Troy is not a shy guy. He stands his ground against defenders. I read that he did very well on his Ireland debut against New Zealand and I expect him to play lots more matches for Ireland and Tottenham</p>

I didn’t have the time to say goodbye to everyone, even though it felt like I played a lot of games where everyone said and thought I would be gone the next day. I have so many unbelievable memories over the last six and a half years I was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. I enjoyed being at the training ground everyday and playing games in the stadium so much, but sometimes you just want to try something new! So, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans, it has been a pleasure to play at your club and hopefully we meet again in the future!</p>

  <p><b>[Eriksen: I was a ‘black sheep’ at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and got the blame for being the ‘bad guy’]</b> I did get the blame for a lot of stuff, for being the bad guy. If you have a short contract, you will be the black sheep. Of course, I did the interview. I was very honest. I felt I had to be honest. I didn’t want to hide like a lot of players do. Everyone is different. I was honest. I wanted to say it out loud. I did get the blame for a lot of stuff, for being the bad guy. I read I was the bad person in the changing room, that ever since I said I wanted to leave, it was no good me being there. To be honest, over the last few years, if anything came up, any player would think about leaving but I was the guy who said it publicly<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was relieved to quiet all the background noise after sealing a switch to Inter]</b> Yes. England, for the last few years, was very hectic. After what I said in the summer, it was just about ‘when is he going to leave?’ Every game it was ‘Is he leaving? Is he not leaving?’ Of course, a lot of people were speaking about it. Even the fans you see on the street were like ‘Thank you, goodbye and good luck’. But I was still there. It was a bit weird. In my head and for my body, it is good that I am in a new place and I can start again<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho began to build a team without him as soon as he arrived in north London]</b> He told me]&lt;/b&gt; to rent his house <b>[In Italy]</b> and then he wished me the best. He knew my wishes, that’s why he built the team without me. That’s right, I was clear from the start<br /><br /><b>[Eriksen admitting that the rest of the top flight has grown a little envious of the Reds]</b> Everyone thought it was <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. But when you see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[…]</b> wow, what a show. They always know what to do, they play ‘easy’, they are extraordinary, what they are doing is incredible. They are scary, it’s nice to see them, you know that they will win in the end, I think everyone looking at them is a little envious</p>

  <p><b>[Inter midfielder Christian Eriksen has admitted that he held talks with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over a possible transfer]</b> For a few years but it was never really likely. We did speak to them, of course, and we did hear what was possible and what wasn’t possible. But, in the end, me personally, I wanted a new challenge. To stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would have been an easy solution. Of course, staying at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> would also have been a solution but, for me, it just came down to wanting to try a new challenge in a new country. Once Inter came up it really wasn’t a difficult choice<br /><br />The Champions League final was such a special moment. In the history of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it was the first time. To be there was so nice and beautiful. But you lose and the next day it is the end of the world. That is how it goes. Afterwards it was difficult. People were still sad from the Champions League final when the season started. After you get a few bad results, then you go into a spiral you are not used to and it was difficult to come back up. But if you look at <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, there is only one team that is really flying. All the others are trying to find their place, not only <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Some seasons are like that. The history of the last five years is of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> being where they have not been before for a long time. It was not a time to end but, in a way, it just came along which was something we didn’t expect and didn’t want<br /><br /><b>[Eriksen added on making the transition from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> with Inter]</b> Historically, it is not that easy to come in January. Everyone is at the same fitness level because they have trained together all season. I need to fit in with how they play and learn the different things they do</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Spurs star Eriksen revels in first Milan derby victory]</b> It was a great experience. The first half was sad, but winning like that with a comeback was very, very special. Now I can leave the stadium with a huge smile on my face. The fans had prepared this huge choreography that took up the entire end of the stadium. You don’t get that atmosphere in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, partly because they’re not allowed to. Here, you really feel the fans pushing you on from the moment you arrive in the team bus. They are slapping their hands on the side of the vehicle, you feel their passion and understand how important this match is<br /><br />At the start, I had thought of doing one of the free-kick routines we had studied, putting it into the crowd. But then I saw Milan were defending very deep and we wouldn’t have much of a chance. I looked at <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a>, who told me to go for it, so I did. I really hit it well, but not well enough, seeing as it didn’t go in. Considering the way the game ended, that crossbar is not a nightmare moment, but a satisfying one. If it had gone in, that would’ve been sheer ecstasy, the cherry on a super cake<br /><br /><b>[Eriksen added on how quickly he has settled in at Inter]</b> I really feel that many fans are happy I am here. That fires me up, it motivates me, it pushes me in the right direction and helps me to settle in. So far, everything has gone really well</p>
