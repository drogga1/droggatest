But we know it won’t come easy.<br /><br />I came to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> six years ago and it’s been an upwards curve since. We’ve been in the top four for many years and have been in the Champions League. It would be statement to be able to win this competition.

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen has conceded that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been lucky during their run to the Champions League final]</b> I don’t know if it’s destiny. I think at the moment we’ve just been lucky! First of all, with the City game, with Sterling, I thought we were out. Gone. Then <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> was a bit different because it was during the game. There was no waiting or standing around. It was just Lucas pops up at the right time. It was nerve-wracking and it was dramatic. We’re just happy we were on the right side. It has <b>[been up and down]</b>. A lot has happened. In the group stage, after three games we were a bit far behind. Things changed and going into the other games in the knockout stages they were intense.<br /><br /><b>[Sterling’s disallowed goal was]</b> mad. Mad. It was weird. I passed the ball away and they went through and ended up scoring. It would have been a disaster. For a few minutes, it was about trying to get back in the game because there was still in a few minutes to go. In the end, it was lucky they changed it and it fell our way because it would have been very, very painful. Going into the City game, the second one, and the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> game, the second one, were something were exciting but luckily they fell on our side. We would have felt very down and we wouldn’t be standing here if they hadn’t gone our way. There were a lot of ups and downs, it was very exciting as a fan. But a bit unnerving.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if it’s a chance for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> players to become legends]</b> Of course. Now it depends if they keep winning, year after year. It changes. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> as a club, if you look from a historical point of view from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at how many trophies they’ve won before, where they’ve been before, it’s new. It’s something that will change the club, how people look at the club, how people think about us players at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. We’re not going to be Spursy, or whatever they call it. As a player you just go for the moment and hope it falls your way</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen has hinted he would be interested in a move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> after revealing he wants to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to try something new]</b> I feel that I am at a place in my career where I might want to try something new. I have the deepest respect for everything that has happened at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but I have also said that I would like to try something new. I hope there will be clarification during the summer. That’s the plan. In football you do not know when clarification will come. It can happen anytime. It would be best for everyone if it happens as soon as possible, but in football things take time.<br /><br />It depends on <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>. And another club has to come in. Or I have to sit down at the table and negotiate a new contract. You can’t set a date yourself. If I have to go, then hopefully it will be a step up.

But it is football and you never know what happens in football. Many things always come into play. To me it is not difficult to clear my head. I don’t read much of what is written. And now I have been involved for many years, where there have been many rumours every year. But it’s clear that it’s been a little more fierce this year because my contract is about to expire. I know a lot of people are interested in where I want to play. That’s the way it is. This is how it is in a top club if you have done well. There will always be rumours</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen admits to ‘hardest time’ as exit talk rages and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> form is questioned]</b> It doesn’t matter at all. Everyone is professional and in all clubs there is talk of players going away. That side of the matter has no bearing on how we have performed so far this season. If I, as a football player, took all the rumours to me, I would float on a cloud. But I know that it can’t all be true. It does not affect me what is written<br /><br />It’s definitely my hardest time right now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. The first year when I came was probably a bit up and down, but since <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> came in 2014 it has been a success story. Expectations for us are at a completely different level now. We have to win every time and it’s the same feeling we have as players as well. We as players must try to keep all the negative things completely out. But the reason for our results is actually hard to answer. We can’t close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky</p>

There is not that big a difference, except that I play a little less this year. I don’t feel there is a connection between my contract situation and the fact that I haven’t played as many matches<br /><br />I might take a little more chance than certain other positions on the pitch. Of course there are mistakes, and the decisions taken must also be carried out correctly. They may have been a little bit missing. I’ve been in the right situations. I just haven’t taken the right decisions. It’s a bit about the sharpness that is missing. This is something I have to work on myself<br /><br />The national team is something completely different to a club team. They are two very different things. So the drop I may have got in the club, which is not a big drop, should not matter. But at least I have enough confidence in the bank to be able to play some nice football. So that shouldn’t hamper me</p>

If you have a short contract, you will be the black sheep. Of course, I did the interview. I was very honest. I felt I had to be honest. I didn’t want to hide like a lot of players do. Everyone is different. I was honest. I wanted to say it out loud. I did get the blame for a lot of stuff, for being the bad guy. I read I was the bad person in the changing room, that ever since I said I wanted to leave, it was no good me being there. To be honest, over the last few years, if anything came up, any player would think about leaving but I was the guy who said it publicly<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was relieved to quiet all the background noise after sealing a switch to Inter]</b> Yes. England, for the last few years, was very hectic. After what I said in the summer, it was just about ‘when is he going to leave?’ Every game it was ‘Is he leaving? Is he not leaving?’ Of course, a lot of people were speaking about it. Even the fans you see on the street were like ‘Thank you, goodbye and good luck’. But I was still there. It was a bit weird.

That is how it goes. Afterwards it was difficult. People were still sad from the Champions League final when the season started. After you get a few bad results, then you go into a spiral you are not used to and it was difficult to come back up. But if you look at <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, there is only one team that is really flying. All the others are trying to find their place, not only <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Some seasons are like that. The history of the last five years is of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> being where they have not been before for a long time.

You don’t get that atmosphere in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, partly because they’re not allowed to.
