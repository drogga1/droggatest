  <p><b>[Chelsea centre-back Jake Clarke-Salter has joined Birmingham on a season-long loan]</b> Blues have signed Jake Clarke-Salter on a season-loan from Chelsea. The Club beat off significant competition for the England Under-21s Captain. Clarke-Salter spent last season on loan to Vitesse Arnhem, impressing just like fellow new Blues recruit Dan Crowley did in the Eredivisie. The centre-half went to watch Blues in their pre-season friendly at Bristol Rovers on Saturday and that helped seal the deal for Pep Clotet. Other Championship clubs were keen on his signature, but the 21-year-old decided on joining the revamped Blues. The terms of the loan allow Clarke-Salter to appear for Blues in both the EFL and FA Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Clotet leaves Birmingham City before end of season]</b> <a href="pep-clotet.html">Pep Clotet</a> has this evening left his position as head coach. He was due to step down at the season’s end but it was mutually agreed that he should relinquish the role immediately. The board would like to place on record its sincere thanks to Pep for his efforts during the past two years. We will be making no further comment at this time</p>
