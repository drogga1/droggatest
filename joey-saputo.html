  <p><b>[Joey Saputo assures Ignacio Piatti will remain with Impact amid transfer rumors]</b> Before Nacho left <b>[for vacation]</b> he made it very very clear to us - he made it very clear to me - that this is where he wants to be. I know that during the holidays rumors came out that clubs in Argentina were looking for him and that he may not be back. The chances that Nacho’s back, I’d say they’re 100 percent. We always get inquires, but to say that we turned down an offer? I wouldn’t say that we turned down an offer.</p>

  <p><b>[Midfielder Blerim Dzemaili has joined the Montreal Impact on loan from Bologna FC 1909]</b> I’m not hiding it: Dzemaili’s contract is a multi-year deal. He’ll be in Bologna until June 2017, and he will then be transferred to Montreal. He’s not hiding that either. He’s ready to come to Montreal.</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have signed Algeria international Saphir Taider as a designated player on loan from Serie A side Bologna]</b> We’re very happy to welcome Saphir with our club. He’s a very competitive player who has played over 100 games with Bologna FC since 2012. This signing will help the team to reach his goals.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> confirm <a href="roberto-donadoni.html">Donadoni</a> departure]</b> I consider <a href="roberto-donadoni.html">Donadoni</a> to be an excellent coach. He has given our club an important credibility. We felt, however, that after three years his cycle in <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> had come to an end despite the commitment and dedication that he and his staff have always shown. I wish him the best fortunes for the rest of his career</p>
