<blockquote>
  <p>[Colombia will be using England’s belief that they are in the better half of the World Cup draw as motivation to win Tuesday’s last-16 clash] The one team who will be relishing all this is Colombia - what greater motivation than an England team believing playing them is an easier way to glory! Who on earth ever thought that somehow Colombia would be the easy route, one of the best attacking teams in world football and a side who reached the Olympic quarter-finals? I would love to be in charge of the Colombia team this week, reminding my players how England don’t respect them. The England players will know this too.<br /><br />The thing I am really struggling with, though, is a much bigger point. England have hardly covered themselves in glory in tournaments over the last two decades yet they were wasting time and energy and getting distracted thinking about possible quarter-finals and semi-finals. Don’t even go there, just win the next match and the next after that. I have been amazed how former players used unity in the squad as a reason for Southgate’s selection - well, if this is what creates unity, we have zero chance. Unity is simply everyone doing everything that is required of them to win the next match even if that is just carrying the water bottle</p>
