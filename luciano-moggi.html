  <p><b>[Luciano Moggi Condemns <a href="john-elkann.html">John Elkann</a> For Not Defending <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> During Calciopoli]</b> Dear <a href="john-elkann.html">Elkann</a>. I find it surprising to read the columns of the Corriere della Sera regarding your resentment against those who have accused <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> during Calciopoli when it was you who accepted the sentence.<br /><br />See <a href="john-elkann.html">Elkann</a>, when you’re on the side of truth and when you have the responsibility of an honest centennial history and dignity of fifteen million fans that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are proud of the victories that they enjoyed with their families, then we have the ‘moral obligation to address the injustices and lies with courage and sacrifice, as well as the history and professional staff who writes this letter.<br /><br />Remember that even before the sporting trial, you probably were not too surprised by what was happening and turned towards the glorious future, considering the recent international success that the new management has succeeded to collect, you had already decided to abandon me and Giraudo to our fate, refusing to defend and indeed, even worse, instructing your lawyer to accept passively any decision.<br /><br />However, your suicidal feelings were not yet appeased true, how true that after the presentation of the appeal to the TAR in September 2006 for the annulment of judgments and suspension of the beginning of league pending a more just and equitable process, you decided that this action went withdrawn and that the decisions of the Federation were accepted rather than contested and then with public thanks from <a href="sepp-blatter.html">Blatter</a> to Montezemolo!<br /><br />During the second line of investigation, namely the alleged foreign Sim called Calciopoli 2, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, on this occasion assisted by Franzo Grande Stevens, rather than defend themselves effectively as I did, preferred to negotiate and pay 300 thousand Euros!<br /><br />Not even a fervid and unpredictable mind as that of Alfred Hitchcock would have imagined that the victim of a mechanism could become a hit with theater that was itself guilty … But you managed it with success in the trial of Turin.<br /><br />In the comic (if not so tragic …) scenario, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> managed by you, was not only limited not to defend itself and its leaders who have truly served for 13 years of success and victory ‘at no cost ‘- as your marketing experts would say during the launch of a new car - but even accused me, Giraudo and Bettega (why not?) of misconduct in terms of economic-management, but then it was promptly refuted by a careful examination by the court. <br /><br />Remember that the absolution should apply to you as a conviction. I read in a statement from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> that the club ‘hopes the institutions and organs of justice will ensure equal treatment for all, as indeed the company and its lawyers demanded in the course of 2006 Sports (!!!) .<br /><br />You <a href="john-elkann.html">Elkann</a>, with your unexpected and tardy repentance, remind me of the Unnamed Betrothed, who after a night of moral and existential anguish decides to repent and make a positive change to his life.<br /><br />Sure one asks where it was and what you did and read over these four years, only to realize now that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, the healthy and successful of the tirade, has been unfairly vilified and humiliated, as well as accused by partial and contradictory evidence.<br /><br />I also ask what you mean when you speak of ‘equal treatment that the defense had asked the Company during the sport trial’. Certainly not to have successfully proposed the demotion, and revocation of two league titles won honestly on the pitch, the sell-off of a list of players worldwide and to the strengthening of Inter at promotional costs!<br /><br />To think evil is a sin, but often one finds the truth behind this and who knows if your repentance is an attempt to divert attention from the disasters that your enlightened management has been able to give the fans. Want to see that the devil Moggi is returning again and will be useful to you and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> after years of court battles and lonely suffering?﻿</p>

The idea was to make a swap deal with Marcelo Salas as <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> wanted to sell him. Trouble is, Portuguese football wasn’t too interesting at the time and we didn’t manage to persuade Salas to move to Portugal. Contracts and papers were ready, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was happy because in that moment <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> were one of the best teams in Europe. That day we could have changed the history of European football, maybe <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> could have still been a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player.

This is what I think after talking to important people<br /><br /><b>[Moggi recalled his attempts to make <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player in 2002]</b> I received an alert. I sent an observer to look at him, he was an 18-year-old boy, but he impressed me with his maturity and his choices.. In the middle of the day I made the contract. Unfortunately, Marcelo Salas refused to sign for Sporting Lisbon because he wanted to return to River Plate. I offered five million more for an 18-year-old player, but it could not be done at that time</p>

  <p><b>[Former Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi has compared Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s physique to that of Cristiano Ronaldo’s as he backed the Swede’s ability to still cut it in Serie A]</b> This would be something not useful, but more. Zlatan has a biological body that allows him to make the best even at his age, just like Cristiano Ronaldo. He is sowing victories everywhere, even in America. Certainly it will not be as easy in Serie A, but the goals have to be made wherever we go to play and, if he came to Fiorentina, even for the youth players it would be fantastic because they could perhaps learn something more from him that not even the coach is able to give. But it is obvious that he is no longer the player he used to be<br /><br /><b>[While backing Ibrahimovic to have a big impact in Italy, Moggi isn’t convinced the likes of Suso and Franck Ribery could have the same impact]</b> Suso and Ribery I have doubts that they can be useful, it takes a player who gives substance like him</p>
