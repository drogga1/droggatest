  <p>[Qatar head coach Felix Sanchez said his team’s late 1-0 Copa America defeat against Colombia left a bad taste] It leaves us with a bad taste because the end was already close. Score a goal in the final minutes, when the game is tied … You leave with the bitterness of not being able to score but we also have to value that the team competed with a great rival. We played against one of the best teams in the world. Despite the loss, we competed until the final whistle. This will give us strength to keep working and preparing for the future.</p>

  <p>[Felix Sanchez says Qatar are not at the Copa America to take selfies with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> as the tournament guests look to stun Argentina and qualify for the quarter-finals] It’s true we are not very well known in South America, but we have super-professional players and we’ve come to compete, not to take photos with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. They’re the favourites and are obliged to win. We’ll try to compete against a great team who have the best player in the world. We have a chance to qualify and that’s what’s exciting, not the fact we could knock out a monster like Argentina.<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can be decisive in any game due to his quality, hundreds of coaches have spent ages trying to stop him but there’s no magic formula, it all depends on Leo’s feet. However much you focus on it it’s very difficult to stop him, but we’ll try to prevent him from getting involved in the play in the final third of the pitch</p>

  <p>[Qatar head coach Felix Sanchez said the Copa America and a showdown with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> provided great experience for the Asian champions] Of course, a player like Leo <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can make a difference. Sometimes with goals, or with assists. We tried to mark the pass lines so that he did not participate so much in the game, but we know that it is difficult because he occupies several areas of the field. I think we managed to make sure that Leo <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> did not score goals, but in the end, we conceded two goals and the result is the same. But it was worth the experience, playing with a team with the most decisive player in the world. Another experience to learn and improve Qatar in the future.<br /><br />[Sanchez was waspish in the build up to the game though, insisting his team was not there to make up the numbers] It’s true we are not very well known in South America, but we have super-professional players and we’ve come to compete, not to take photos with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. They’re the favourites and are obliged to win. We’ll try to compete against a great team who have the best player in the world</p>
