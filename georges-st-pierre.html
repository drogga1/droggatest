  <p>One time I was fighting against BJ Penn. I had his back against the fence. I’m not kidding you, for a few seconds I look and I was staring at a beautiful woman in the audience. It was … uh … (snaps fingers) Cindy Crawford. I stared at her. I’m thinking, ‘My God, she’s so beautiful. And she’s looking at me.’ And just next to her, I see her husband looking at me and I’m like, ‘Oh my God. I can’t look at her. Her husband’s looking at me.’ Now I’m thinking, ‘Of course, they’re looking at me. I’m doing the show right now and I’m in the middle of the fight.’ So I’m like, ‘Go back to your focus’ (laughs).</p>

  <p><b>[UFC welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre talks about his life]</b> I love what I do. I love it even more right now, more than before. I want to do this for a long time and I’m very happy with my life. I see myself as the challenger for this fight and I need to take the belt from the champion. It’s a little similar to when I was challenging Matt Serra <b>[for the title]</b>. The feeling is similar. I’m going against the champion, I’m ready, I’m the best I can be and I have no regret about my preparation. I’m going to go in there, leave it all in the cage and come away victorious<br /><br />The pressure is always there, but I’m at my best when I fight under pressure. All my fights have had pressure since I fought Matt Hughes in my first title fight<br /><br /><b>[One man who has been there throughout St-Pierre’s career is Jiu Jitsu coach John Danaher]</b> I met John when I was in New York a few years ago. I couldn’t speak English at the time, so he wasn’t my coach, but as I started to learn English he became my instructor and I started to learn my Jiu Jitsu from him and he improved my game incredibly. He’s not only a mentor for me, he’s also a great friend.<br /><br /><b>[Alongside Danaher and Zahabi, a host of world-class martial artists were drafted in to help prepare St-Pierre for the challenge presented by Condit - a well-rounded competitor with excellent kickboxing skills]</b> Two guys came over from Thailand - one of them is a six-time world champion and the other is a very good Muay Thai instructor. They came over to help me improve my reflexes to match the best strikers in the world. I also trained with Braulio Estima, world champion in Brazilian jiu jitsu - and I’ve also been training with a couple of British fighters, Dan Hardy and Tom Watson, as well as Brandon Thatch, who is one of the best strikers in MMA and very similar in style to Carlos Condit, so I’ve been very well prepared<br /><br /><b>[St-Pierre agreed Condit presented the most well-rounded challenge]</b> Condit is a different style of fighter. He’s very smart - and as a fighter that’s his biggest asset. They can expect to see the best Georges St-Pierre they’ve ever seen and I’m going to come out of this victorious</p>

  <p><b>[UFC champion Georges St-Pierre no stranger to personal turmoil]</b> I have never been so messed up mentally in my life. I had a lot of personal issues. A lot of stuff was going wrong.<br /><br /><b>[The champion would not detail what was going on]</b> I need to think. I have stuff going on in my life … This is my personal life. I cannot speak to you about this. You’re a reporter, I know your job is to make thing public. But I have a personal life, I keep personal some of my stuff.<br /><br />People were dying. I had to go to the hospital at night. I was sleeping like maybe two, three hours a night when I was training for that fight. I was sleeping with one eye open because I thought I had to go drive my father to hospital and stuff like that. I was very worried about a lot of things in my life. Not only this, I had a lot of other stuff going on. I forgot who I was, what was my No. 1 priority. I didn’t realize how lucky I was, to have this opportunity to be world champion. Once I lost, I realized all that stuff and it made me regret a lot of things.</p>

  <p><b>[Georges St-Pierre announces he will take a break from fighting]</b> Physically I’m 100 per cent, I’m still young, I’m on top of the world. But mentally I just feel like I cannot go through another training camp right now and I don’t know when I will be able to<br /><br />I’m going to take a break. I need this. I need to have a normal life for a bit. I’ll feel better and come back stronger. <b>[Asked what he wants to get away from, St-Pierre said he loves his sport]</b> As much as I choose to do it, now I choose to not do it … I don’t know when, I don’t know if, I think I will <b>[be back]</b> I can’t say 100 per cent. But right now I just don’t want people thinking about me. I believe one day I will come back. The problem is I don’t know how long <b>[I will be away]</b><br /><br /><b>[As champion, St-Pierre has worn a target on his back since he first won the title in 2006]</b> The situation I’m at, it’s a lot of pressure. It’s like every fight I’m carrying weight on my shoulder. Every fight, it’s like you add weight on your shoulder. Every fight. At one point it comes so heavy that I have a hard time carrying it myself</p>

  <p><b>[Georges St-Pierre was happily retired but did not rule out a return to the Octagon]</b> I don’t envy nobody, I’m retired for a reason. If anything comes up, the UFC knows where to find me. But right now I’m good where I’m at, I can’t complain. Life is beautiful, because of the fans. I’m very grateful<br /><br /><b>[when asked who should face <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> next]</b> One hundred per cent <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a>. It’s gonna be a good fight. I’m a big fan and I’m gonna be watching. <b>[Georges St-Pierre said it was tough to call who would win out of <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> vs Khabib Nurmagomedov]</b> I don’t know, it all depends who’s gonna be able to fight their fight. Tony likes a dirty fight with elbows, knees. That’s his style. Khabib likes to control guys when he’s on the floor, and it’s a tough game. It all depends how it goes down. Styles make fights sometimes, it’s tough to predict</p>
