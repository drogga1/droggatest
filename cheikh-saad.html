<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Spanish club Eldense believe the 12-0 loss to Barcelona B which saw them relegated from the Segunda Division B was fixed]</b> I know who <b>[was involved]</b> but I cannot say at the moment… four players are involved. They did not bother to ask me because they knew what the answer would be. I’d have withdrawn from the team. Half an hour before the game I was in the team and then I wasn’t. After the game I got on the team bus and my teammates told me: ‘You should know that there are players down there <b>[in the dressing room]</b> who threw the match’. I went back down to the dressing room and there was a row going on. There were almost punches thrown. There is even a leader who told the others what to do. They are not involved in any way. Barca B did nothing. They did what they had to do <b>[on the pitch]</b>. If it had been me I would have done the same.<br /><br />I don’t care. When they let me say the names I will say them but I’m not going to go from ground to ground with people laughing at me when I always do my best on the pitch<br /><br />This is not just because of Saturday, it was the last straw, but it’s a lot of things. We’ll figure out a lot of things, but I cannot blame anyone without proof and without the players saying more publicly. There have been very strange things going on. Players who do not play and suddenly they put them in, then they remove players who are doing well</p>
