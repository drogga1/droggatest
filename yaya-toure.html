  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Côte d’Ivoire midfielder Yaya Toure after being named BBC African Footballer of the Year]</b> I work hard every day to be the best I can be, so to be nominated seven times and win this award for a second time means a lot to me. I would also like to pay tribute to my fellow nominees and this fantastic initiative, which celebrates African footballers - shining a light on our wonderful continent. We have so much talent in Africa, so I am determined to continue to achieve on the pitch and use my success to help lead the way for the next generation</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has told Raheem Sterling that he is too honest and should have dived to win a penalty in Manchester City’s 2-2 draw with Tottenham]</b> If he’d dived everyone would have been saying, ‘It’s a dive’. If you have a bit of experience like me, you’d maybe dive in that situation, and that’s maybe what you have to do. He’s too honest. He wants to be proper in these sorts of games. If the lad is like that, you can’t tell him he’s wrong. When you see it, he can’t miss from there. He was so close and after that Walker pushes him in the back<br /><br />The manager and the players are frustrated because we feel like we’ve been robbed. I’ll go home and watch the highlights and probably break the glass <b>[on the TV]</b> because we’ve lost two points like that. If the referee looks at the highlights as well he is going to feel something is unfair. We all do wrongs in life, but this is difficult to take</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure would welcome the opportunity to head back to Barcelona if those at Camp Nou made a move to snap him up as a free agent]</b> I would head back to Barcelona. If Barcelona calls me, I will go for sure, they are the best team. I miss <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi and <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta. Barcelona have been the most important team of my life. They have given me humility, experience and the knowledge of how to behave on the field.<br /><br /><b>[On Andres Iniesta]</b> He is a formidable person.

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has joked that he would like to join Manchester United so that he can help Paul Pogba fulfil his potential]</b> It’s difficult because of the way the media has treated <b>[Pogba]</b>. We don’t have the same characteristics because for me I was involved in all the ball, I ran everywhere. I liked that. I was prepared for that. I was working for that for a long time. When I was in the academy in Africa I had to run everywhere, get box to box in 50 seconds. It’s something I’ve been loving to do. Pogba is the same size, power - but different in the way he wants to go. Technically and in the ability to score goals as well. It’s a player I want to play with, to be honest, just to teach him some things. Pogba is a great player. He’s a fantastic player. He’s a little bit young at the moment.<br /><br />Criticism is a part of life. If they criticise you it’s because they want you to be good or be better. I’ve been criticised and I love to be criticised. I like it. I don’t mind if people talk about me - it’s good. It means I have to achieve, I have to be better. Even if you continue to be at the peak of your game, sometimes they are going to find something to tell you. It’s part of life. We have to deal with that<br /><br /><b>[He hopes to find a positive environment for next term]</b> I don’t rule big teams out. The big teams are very important for me. What they want to achieve, the way they want to go, for me is very important. I want to go somewhere I can win and achieve. It’s going to be hard one day to play against City, but I have to do that. It is part of my job. I’ve been playing football for such a long time, I’m no good in the office or something else. I am good in football. To see myself at a different club is going to be difficult. I have been such a big part of City for such a long time now. I just want to say that definitely I will continue to play at a high level - Champions League or Europa League. I want to play two more years. They have to be in the higher level and then I can do something else</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has hit out at Pep Guardiola, claiming the Manchester City coach has a problem with players from Africa]</b> I want to be the one who breaks the Guardiola myth. I tried to understand it and I even asked coaches for my stats. When I realised that they were as good or better, both in training and in matches, as those who played and were younger than me, I understood that it was not question of physicality. I don’t know why but I have the impression that he was jealous, he took me for a rival. I have the impression that Pep, without acknowledgment or respect, did everything to spoil my last season. He was cruel with me. Do you really think he could’ve been like that with Andres Iniesta? It got to the point I asked myself if it was because of my colour. I’m not the first, other Barca players asked the question too. Maybe us Africans aren’t always treated the same by certain people. When you see the problems <b>[Pep]</b> has often had with African players, everywhere he has been, I ask myself questions. He’s too intelligent to be caught. He’ll never admit <b>[not liking African players]</b>. But the day he picks a team with five Africans in it, I promise I will send him a cake! Beyond that, Pep likes to dominate and wants to have obedient players who kiss his hands. I don’t like that kind of relationship. I respect my coach but I’m not his thing.<br /><br />He stole my farewell with City, a club with beautiful fans. I would have liked to leave with emotion of this club the way Iniesta <b>[left Barca]</b> or Gianluigi Buffon <b>[left Juventus]</b>. But Pep prevented me</p>

I have never seen anyone so quick. And he is very cunning when he goes forward.<br /><br />On the other side, I would pick Mendy. Another City player? Yes, so? At the top of his form, he has impressive power and speed and crosses well. Up front, they will feast on his service<br /><br />Down the middle, Aguero is no longer the most talented but he is a clever opportunist</p>

For me, as captain, I was wearing an armband which said ‘No to racism’ and I was totally disappointed. I want to see UEFA do something and take some action.

We will see because sometimes in Europe people look at ages in a different way - it’s not about that. It depends on the club and what they want to achieve. I don’t want to go too far and propose myself but I just want them to give me a chance, we will see. In my mind I give myself one or maybe two years maximum playing football, after that I want to enjoy myself with my family and try to work in other ways.<br /><br />I want to be proud of myself. As a footballer sometimes when you stop it early it is because people are trying to stop you, it’s not coming from your heart, it’s complicated.

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure backs <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>’s faltering Ivorian Football Association presidential campaign]</b> It’s time for change in our football. It needs modernity. When I say I support <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, it’s also for the good of the country, to have a former player of his kind investing himself in Africa. Didier was my big brother, my captain. People talked a lot about us but we were always calm, wise. We know each other. Too many people tried to criticise him - the press, fans<br /><br />I know he is looking for support and I hope he will get it from some of the voters, presidents of clubs or AFI (Ivorian Association of Football Players)</p>

You don’t have to think about which great player will be signed, but rather that we will be bringing great players. If it is not one, it will be another.
