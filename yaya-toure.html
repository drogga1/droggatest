  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Côte d’Ivoire midfielder Yaya Toure after being named BBC African Footballer of the Year]</b> I work hard every day to be the best I can be, so to be nominated seven times and win this award for a second time means a lot to me. I would also like to pay tribute to my fellow nominees and this fantastic initiative, which celebrates African footballers - shining a light on our wonderful continent. We have so much talent in Africa, so I am determined to continue to achieve on the pitch and use my success to help lead the way for the next generation</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has told Raheem Sterling that he is too honest and should have dived to win a penalty in Manchester City’s 2-2 draw with Tottenham]</b> If he’d dived everyone would have been saying, ‘It’s a dive’. If you have a bit of experience like me, you’d maybe dive in that situation, and that’s maybe what you have to do. He’s too honest. He wants to be proper in these sorts of games. If the lad is like that, you can’t tell him he’s wrong. When you see it, he can’t miss from there. He was so close and after that Walker pushes him in the back<br /><br />The manager and the players are frustrated because we feel like we’ve been robbed. I’ll go home and watch the highlights and probably break the glass <b>[on the TV]</b> because we’ve lost two points like that. If the referee looks at the highlights as well he is going to feel something is unfair. We all do wrongs in life, but this is difficult to take</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus has made an immediate impact at Manchester City following his winter arrival]</b> He is a very good player. He’s very quick, sharp and clever. We realise we have to be careful, though, and we shouldn’t get too excited because he has to be focused. What we want to do is just continue to keep going and at the end of the season we can talk about him. We have to keep focused because we have important games coming up and we have to be ready for that as well.<br /><br />We need to have young players because City are always a team who wants to win the league. The mentality of the club is to try to get new players in and try to do as best as possible. When you see <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne, <b>[David]</b> Silva, Jesus, Sane, and Raheem playing well, you realise we have a great squad with some young players</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has warned Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus against complacency]</b> The new guys have a big potential. Sane has been ­unbelievable, Raheem has always been very good, and we are seeing what Jesus can do. But sometimes, when you are young, you start to think that football is easy. They have got to keep working hard, pushing all the time to improve, because the moment you think you have arrived can also be the moment when you start to slip. That’s why the experienced players are important. Me, Vincent <b>[Kompany]</b>, David <b>[Silva]</b>, Zaba <b>[Pablo Zabaleta]</b>, we are pushing them all the time to get better. This club is all about winning trophies. When new players come in, they have fantastic skill, but they also have to learn the winning mentality.<br /><br /><b>[Toure insists he has at least five years left in him at the top level]</b> I can go on for another five years. You don’t believe me? OK, let’s make a bet</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure says that he joined Manchester City so he could help them become more like their rivals Manchester United]</b> My time here has been great. My mentality has always been the same. I always enjoy it. The plan of this club in the beginning was to try to get players to win, to change the club into a winning machine like Manchester United or Barcelona. That’s what made me decide to come here because what the club was trying to do was bring in big players - winning players.<br /><br />We’re looking forward. We still have competitions coming - the Champions League, the FA Cup - and we’re going to try to do our best for those guys who come to watch and enjoy football. My mentality is always like that. I try, at the end of the season, to lift a trophy - it’s one of the most beautiful things that can happen to me<br /><br />I played for Barcelona four of five years ago in a deeper position so I know what to do. I’ve been able to play in defence, in midfield, as a striker. If the manager asked me to play as a goalkeeper I’m capable of that too! I just try to enjoy the game and try to give my experience to the young players</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure says Manchester City will not make the same mistake as Paris Saint-Germain when they take on Monaco in the Champions League]</b> No, no, definitely no, we cannot be in that position, otherwise we’re going to be wrong. You saw Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona, it was unbelievable. It was the sort of game you can’t imagine. We can’t go there relaxed. In the dressing room, those kind of games are warnings, you know, because after the game against Stoke we went into the dressing room and we saw Barca win 6-1. You cannot imagine how the European Cup is so serious this year, and we can’t underestimate Monaco.<br /><br />From my point of view and maybe the manager’s too, the best way to defend is to attack. If you sit deeper … when I watched PSG-Barcelona, PSG had fantastic players up front but they were trying to defend. I think it was a lack of intensity or maybe lack of … when you go and play games like that and you are four goals in front … I think that is the wrong thing to do. We are going to attack, we never do it the other way, we will attack and they will expect that as well<br /><br />Monaco is going to be another final, like <b>[Saturday]</b>, it’s going to be very tough, and I think the defence was very good, we were careful, because Adama <b>[Traore]</b> was very, very quick, <b>[Alvaro]</b> Negredo too, and it’s not easy to play against a team like that, but I think today is a good example for the game we are going to have on Wednesday. In Europe you’re going to find such tough strikers. I think from my point of view Falcao is similar to <b>[Alvaro]</b> Negredo, and as well <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe is like Adama <b>[Traore]</b>, although Adama is much, much quicker. It’s going to be tough because they have fantastic players, like <b>[Bernardo]</b> Silva, <b>[Thomas]</b> Lemar<br /><br />In the game <b>[against Middlesbrough]</b> I was feeling that if we score the goal maybe it could be seven or eight today, to be honest and with all the respect to Middlesbrough. The team were unbelievable, they played very well, they were sharp and quick. I don’t know, maybe the strikers are saving it for Wednesday but definitely it could easily have been five or seven to be honest</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure keen for stay after being given new lease of life under Guardiola]</b> Definitely. I love this football club. The day I will be done, I’ll know myself. I know my body and I’ll say, ‘Yes, I’m done’<br /><br />To be honest the manager was the one who tried to get my best. Last year I was overweight, it was a difficult situation, there were a lot of problems with my family. I was talking with him most of the time and people were not seeing that on the screen. Those talks will stay between him and me. He knows what I can do and what I’m capable of doing. Like he said, he’s been honest with me. He is the guy that pushed me up, made me come back and that’s why I’m feeling respectful with him and that’s why I want to show him he was right. Psychologically he was quite hard. To manage a football player at this time is so difficult because football players have to deal with so many things<br /><br />People have different ways of behaving. We are human beings as sportspeople and we have to understand that. He’s been clever in a lot of aspects, not just with me. He is a special guy in football and I think for me it was something quite bizarre in the beginning. I knew him from. Barcelona and Barcelona was tough in the beginning as well because the guy is a hard worker and he wants his players at 100 per cent. ‘Just do what I want on the field and we are friends. If you don’t, bye</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has acknowledged that the next few weeks have the potential to make or break Manchester City’s season]</b> Arsenal and Chelsea are tough games, but we have the chance to come a little bit closer to the top. If we can get points there, it will be brilliant. It’s all about the next two weeks. All that’s important now is finishing the season strongly - finishing in the top four - giving the ­Champions League to the fans again. We have to fight. We’re in the semi-finals of the FA Cup <b>[where they face Arsenal again, on April 23]</b> - that’s a brilliant cup. Of course, City deserve more, but we’ve such a lot of young players we need time and, in the future, we can be a perfect team.<br /><br />We’ve been very strong away. We have more space and we’re delighted to play in big stadiums because we have the space to play. We hope we can take all six points, because this league is so difficult. Teams know how we play at home and always close us down. Most of the time they use the counter-attack. We have to be aware, when we lose the ball, they are going to go fast and counter-attack. They’re going to be quick and do some damage. We ­normally can control it well, but, against Liverpool, they got the penalty. I think our team has ­progressed very well… until ­Monaco. The players were very sad in the dressing room. We deserved more in the Champions League. If we’d got to the ­quarter-finals, any team who faced City would have suffered. But this is football, we have to keep on going</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure says Manchester City are now superior to rivals United]</b> It is a big change because in the past United were always able to dominate. They were always able to control and win games, and seeing the fans celebrating like that it shows that City have come close. Of course, the history and achievements of United is much stronger but we are coming. They know now we are difficult to play and they tried to do their best to defend and use the counter-attack. To be honest we played well but when you don’t win it is difficult to take it.<br /><br />Yes, of course, all the time we finish above them in the season, it shows City are doing very well<br /><br /><b>[When asked about United’s potential to improve next season]</b> For sure. United are building something very interesting. We have to be aware of that but I think City are going to be much, much stronger as well. Next year we are going to expect more and I hope United are going to attack a little bit more</p>

Yaya already has offers from different clubs. They are very interesting offers.

He has given his heart to the club and he would find it difficult to leave City.<br /><br />At the moment Yaya is just concentrating on getting City into the Champions League. That is his only focus.

I am very happy because I got no injuries at all. I think they’ve been fantastic for me, always helped, always close, always looking at the details.

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has joked that he would like to join Manchester United so that he can help Paul Pogba fulfil his potential]</b> It’s difficult because of the way the media has treated <b>[Pogba]</b>. We don’t have the same characteristics because for me I was involved in all the ball, I ran everywhere. I liked that. I was prepared for that. I was working for that for a long time. When I was in the academy in Africa I had to run everywhere, get box to box in 50 seconds. It’s something I’ve been loving to do. Pogba is the same size, power - but different in the way he wants to go. Technically and in the ability to score goals as well. It’s a player I want to play with, to be honest, just to teach him some things. Pogba is a great player. He’s a fantastic player. He’s a little bit young at the moment.<br /><br />Criticism is a part of life. If they criticise you it’s because they want you to be good or be better. I’ve been criticised and I love to be criticised. I like it. I don’t mind if people talk about me - it’s good. It means I have to achieve, I have to be better.

It is part of my job. I’ve been playing football for such a long time, I’m no good in the office or something else. I am good in football. To see myself at a different club is going to be difficult. I have been such a big part of City for such a long time now. I just want to say that definitely I will continue to play at a high level - Champions League or Europa League.

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has hit out at Pep Guardiola, claiming the Manchester City coach has a problem with players from Africa]</b> I want to be the one who breaks the Guardiola myth. I tried to understand it and I even asked coaches for my stats. When I realised that they were as good or better, both in training and in matches, as those who played and were younger than me, I understood that it was not question of physicality. I don’t know why but I have the impression that he was jealous, he took me for a rival. I have the impression that Pep, without acknowledgment or respect, did everything to spoil my last season. He was cruel with me. Do you really think he could’ve been like that with Andres Iniesta? It got to the point I asked myself if it was because of my colour. I’m not the first, other Barca players asked the question too. Maybe us Africans aren’t always treated the same by certain people. When you see the problems <b>[Pep]</b> has often had with African players, everywhere he has been, I ask myself questions. He’s too intelligent to be caught. He’ll never admit <b>[not liking African players]</b>. But the day he picks a team with five Africans in it, I promise I will send him a cake! Beyond that, Pep likes to dominate and wants to have obedient players who kiss his hands. I don’t like that kind of relationship. I respect my coach but I’m not his thing.<br /><br />He stole my farewell with City, a club with beautiful fans. I would have liked to leave with emotion of this club the way Iniesta <b>[left Barca]</b> or Gianluigi Buffon <b>[left Juventus]</b>. But Pep prevented me</p>

For me, as captain, I was wearing an armband which said ‘No to racism’ and I was totally disappointed. I want to see UEFA do something and take some action. We have to be as strong as possible, otherwise they will continue like that. Maybe they could ban the stadium, I don’t know, for a couple of years or a couple of months</p>

I don’t want to go too far and propose myself but I just want them to give me a chance, we will see.
