  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Côte d’Ivoire midfielder Yaya Toure after being named BBC African Footballer of the Year]</b> I work hard every day to be the best I can be, so to be nominated seven times and win this award for a second time means a lot to me. I would also like to pay tribute to my fellow nominees and this fantastic initiative, which celebrates African footballers - shining a light on our wonderful continent. We have so much talent in Africa, so I am determined to continue to achieve on the pitch and use my success to help lead the way for the next generation</p>

There have been so many rumours about my future in football but it’s time to make things clear. Football is something I cannot describe, I’ve been playing since I was young, and I will continue playing football. When it’s time for me to retire I will do it officially myself.

But after we scored the first goal I didn’t think QPR would be able to handle City. We were so confident and we all said before the game that we would do it. There was pressure when they scored two goals, but we believed we would do it and we did</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure blasts England’s racism reaction. When asked about the Three Lions’ reaction]</b> This is a shame. Why are you playing for England? They are always talking, ‘Blah, blah, blah’, and what? Nothing changes. People from <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> don’t care anyway because we’ve been talking about this, but it’s still continuing. I don’t want to say that I’m not concerned, I’m concerned<br /><br />They have to be serious about it, players need to make serious moves about it otherwise <b>[the racists]</b> will continue to do that. They have to get the players out of the field<br /><br /><b>[The former Ivory Coast international is currently playing in the second tier in China with Qingdao Huanghai, having joined in July]</b> I think I’ll finish in December or January, then go, have another challenge. People are thinking that I’m done, but I’m not done yet. It’s been a nice experience because I’ve seen people with a different mentality from Europe - the way to play football, the way they feel and their behaviour on the field. When I play in the stadiums, nobody boos me because I’m black, it’s a different culture, they respect. In Europe, they respect nobody</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> legend Yaya Toure wants <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return as he still has two years left at the top]</b> I would love it but it depends on which kind of team. We will see because sometimes in Europe people look at ages in a different way - it’s not about that. It depends on the club and what they want to achieve. I don’t want to go too far and propose myself but I just want them to give me a chance, we will see. In my mind I give myself one or maybe two years maximum playing football, after that I want to enjoy myself with my family and try to work in other ways.<br /><br />I want to be proud of myself. As a footballer sometimes when you stop it early it is because people are trying to stop you, it’s not coming from your heart, it’s complicated. I remember when I was in Greece and people were speculating about my career - I was not happy. Something was missing. I want to be in control. I think I have to start to do my <b>[coaching]</b> badges. Football has been all my life from when I was a kid until now. Football is part of me and I can stop watching football or being part of it.<br /><br /><b>[He has seen City fall nine points adrift of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> leaders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as they seek to chase down a third successive crown and the former Blues star believes <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> will dip into the January transfer market in an effort to aid his cause]</b> I think it is going to be hard but in January City have to get a defender. It is never too late. I don’t want to blame Rodrigo, but if <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> was in the middle it would be really important. City miss him in there, he is strong, sharp, clever and anticipates and tackles. I respect the decision of the manager but I don’t like him in defence</p>

In the game on Sunday they were face to face and then straight to the international team. It can happen, me and my brother fight, we argue, we smash each other. The manager should just take him away. It’s not good for the player’s mentality<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> could be a little bit disappointed with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>. Raheem is still young and learning. If my player acted like that, being angry and showing himself like this, I would be very happy. This means he wants to win and achieve - that is important. A player without this character, for me, is nonsense. Raheem is one of the best players in England at the moment. I think <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is not in his best moment, Raheem is the best player for England. For him to be in this kind of situation, with all the pressure around him and on his shoulders, he has to deal with racism, plus the fact he was playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> where the fans are booing him - it can affect him.

I think me and my point of view <b>[is that]</b> football is something that is very important. But I think footballers have to stay with football and politicians do politics because you cannot be involved in these kinds of things. It’s going to attract a lot of problems and to be honest, as a Muslim, it’s complicated. It’s his choice, he’s been doing his comments <b>[on social media]</b>, but I think he was wrong to say that</p>
