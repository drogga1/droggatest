<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Montpellier defender blames Football Manager for receiving Bolivia call]</b> Bolivia has contacted me. It’s something quite strange though <b>[laughs]</b>. I think basically it all starts from the game Football Manager. They had put me Bolivian nationality in addition to French nationality<br /><br />Last year, I received messages from Bolivians after my matches. After playing against PSG, it was multiplied by a hundred. I was discussed on social networks, it made things even more compelling. I received a lot of messages.<br /><br />Apparently, in Bolivia, they talked about me on television saying I was selectable. I received a lot of requests from there. I was forced to make a statement on my page to explain that I was not Bolivian so not selectable for selection<br /><br />I am French by my mother and Spanish by my father. I do not have dual nationality yet but I’ve wanted to have it for a while. It is more in relation to family ties than to hope for a Spanish call-up. When a player plays and performs well, he will then be considered. Above all, I would like to have a very good first season <b>[at Montpellier]</b> by playing as many matches as possible. The rest we will see. It is still too early to talk about a future elsewhere. I would like to impose myself here first, then we will see</p>
