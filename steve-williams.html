  <p><b>[The Saint: The Steve Williams interview]</b> If I wanted to play football or cricket and I couldn’t cycle there then I couldn’t play. My mum and dad were too busy so I cycled everywhere and that helped get me fit<br /><br /><b>[He was making a reputation for himself but unable to attract the big London clubs]</b> The Glenn Hoddles and Alan Curbishleys were all signed to clubs but I couldn’t get to them. How could I?<br /><br />Lawrie McMenemy (Saints’ manager), was very clever and knew they had to create a youth policy to compete. So they had to cast their net. I was the first one they looked at with a player called Austin Hayes, who went on to play for Ireland. They gave us two weeks and it was make or break, but they saw something in me<br /><br />They put us in digs, which were awful, and there was no food. We had to steal apples from trees to eat and one day we got caught and I was hauled in front of Ted Payne. I thought that was it. But he offered me an apprenticeship and told me I had two years to prove I was a footballer. I rang my dad straight away, I couldn’t believe it<br /><br /><b>[So the young Williams joined <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> as an apprentice after school, joining a squad that included internationals Peter Osgood, Jim McCalliog and <a href="mick-channon.html">Mick Channon</a>, who particularly looked after Steve]</b> He was good to me was Micky. He used to give me £5 for cleaning his boots. Not bad for a guy on £8 per week! They put me in Mr and Mrs Jones at Bitterne Park and they looked after me. I was getting great food like there was no tomorrow. I stayed there six years and didn’t want to leave. Not even when I met Angie, my wife<br /><br /><b>[On April 6, 1976, Steve made his <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> debut in a local derby at bitter rivals Portsmouth, three days after Saints’ had beaten <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> in an FA Cup semi-final]</b> Osgood, McCalliog and Steele were left out, so I got my chance. I was told I played well, but I don’t remember that. It was a hostile atmosphere; the Pompey fans went at us all game long. Micky Channon had wound them up in the local paper saying, ‘the best thing about Portsmouth is the M27 back to Southampton’. Then, in the last minute, Channon popped up and scored the winner and did his famous windmill celebration in front of them. It was a great feeling to win<br /><br /><b>[Steve had succeeded Ball as team captain and led them to an FA Cup semi-final defeat to eventual winners <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, his biggest regret]</b> I was unfit but they filled me with steroids and let me play, but I could barely move. I would have loved to have led Saints’ to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final, but it wasn’t to be<br /><br /><b>[The world was at Steve’s feet and it looked only a matter of time before he gained full international recognition]</b> <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> players tend not to play for England. England managers were never seen at The Dell. Look at Peter Osgood, he should have played more games for England. They did everything but pick me. It was when the press got involved that they had to<br /><br /><b>[In June 1983, Steve finally got to play for his country, but on the other side of the world, when he stepped out in front of 28,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground alongside England greats like <a href="peter-shilton.html">Peter Shilton</a>, Trevor Francis and Terry Butcher in a 0-0 draw against Australia]</b> Nobody wanted to go to Australia. None of the bigger name players so they picked those that were willing. I enjoyed it but didn’t get to see much of Australia, just the hotels and stadiums<br /><br /><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> actually came in for me when I was 22, but I didn’t go. A senior pro told me later, ‘if you had joined them earlier you would have played 50 games for England, not six!’. But there you go, I am still proud to say I played for England</p>

  <p><b>[Williams believes <a href="southampton-fc.html">the Saints</a> must not be content to sit back and hit <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on the counter attack]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s back four is not the strongest, <b>[Shkodran]</b> <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> especially. So I would say ‘let’s go for them, let’s go for the back four because that’s their weakest part of the team. If you think sitting back is going to win that game, it’s not. It might win one out of ten, you might draw a couple. But I’m not sure <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> can gamble on that any more. They might get beat 3-0 anyway so at least go down with all guns blazing. That’s not being gung-ho, that’s looking at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and thinking ‘what’s their weakness?’ It’s their back four so press their back four. Don’t think you’re going to catch them on the break and get the odd chance. No. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are good going forward. They’ve got players like <b>[Alexandre]</b> <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> who can hurt you, so don’t give them a chance. Get up in their half and give it a go. I don’t see any other way of beating <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the moment because they’re not the best side in the world. You couldn’t do that against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because their back four is pretty strong - or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. But <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> aren’t that strong at the back<br /><br /><b>[With summer signings <a href="sokratis-papastathopoulos.html">Socratis Papastathopoulos</a> and <a href="stephan-lichtsteiner.html">Stephan Lichtsteiner</a> injured and out of favour respectively, <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a>, <a href="nacho-monreal.html">Nacho Monreal</a> and Sead Kolosinac are likely to make up <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defence on Sunday]</b> Unless they get the back four sorted <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won’t be top six. I think the supporters can see that but <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> supporters are getting edgy because they can see ‘here we go again’<br /><br /><a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>’s home form isn’t very good so they need to pick themselves up very, very quickly. All of a sudden these games are becoming massive. It’s so tight, it’s a 50-50 call between Cardiff and <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and you don’t want that. You want a bit of breathing space<br /><br /><b>[Williams believes Saints should adopt a similar approach at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> Man United are on an absolute up but you can’t tell me their back four is that great. They’re pretty lethal going forward at the moment, with <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> coming on. If you don’t watch it you’re going to get beat there anyway so why not have a go at their back four, which looks pretty average to me. United have got similar problems to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the moment. They’re good going forward but pretty weak at the back<br /><br /><a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> don’t look likely to hold on to a 0-0 so I’d be tempted to say ‘let’s go for it in the 12 games we have left’. Go out all guns blazing, at least fighting for survival rather than go out on a whimper. I’m sure the manager wants that. You’d love to put <a href="mick-channon.html">Mick Channon</a> in there to sort a few out, but if Channon came through the youth system now he’d be sold. It’s ridiculous. If you keep selling the family silver you end up struggling at the foot of the division. And with the January window gone, you are what you are. They’re going to have to get their scrapping boots on and pick themselves up very, very quickly. It’s your home form that keeps you up so they need to improve that and just hope they’re better than Cardiff at least. They may well be but I’m not sure they’re creating enough chances, other than <b>[Nathan]</b> Redmond, who looks lively<br /><br /><b>[Steve Williams in his Saints heyday]</b> They need to be brought through at the right time with a run of ten games but you don’t want to put too many kids in when you’re near the bottom scrapping. You don’t know what you’re going to get. Throwing kids in could add to your problems unless they’re very special. If you’re struggling at the bottom of the division you don’t know what’s hit you as a young player. Very rarely can you put two or three in in a dogfight against senior pros. It’s tricky. I wouldn’t want to be in <b>[Hasenhuttl’s]</b> shoes doing that but if you haven’t got anyone else <b>[…]</b> Some young players could freeze in front of 60,000 at the Emirates on what is a massive pitch. If you get beat 3-0 you’re like a rabbit in a spotlight. That can take a bit to get over</p>
