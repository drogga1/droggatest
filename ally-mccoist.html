  <p>[<a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> has been told that ‘Glasglow Rangers are a bigger club’ than <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, with Ally McCoist hoping to see reported interest from St James’s Park fended off] Good managers and good coaches get headhunted. I would probably say the same regarding Steven as I would <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>. The timing is not really perfect, I wouldn’t have thought. I think everybody automatically sees Steven go down the same route that Frank looks as though he’s going down himself and that is a return to the club that you became a hero and a legend at.<br /><br />[McCoist added on the potential draw of a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> post] I think Rangers are a bigger club. I think <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> play in a far better league. That’s the way I see it at this moment in time, and you know what I think of North-East football, I absolutely love the people of the North East and I love the football in the North East, but what kind of step would it be for <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>? They’re both massive clubs. They’re actually similar clubs in terms of their support.<br /><br />I think they’ve got absolutely fanatical support. Great support. Best supporters in the country I feel, so I’m not sure where I’d sit on it to be honest with you, but I’m not sure right now it would be a great move for <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, because he certainly has unfinished business at Rangers. I wish <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> all the very best in their search for a new manager, but leave ours! As they would say in Glasgow, ‘Leave oors alane!’</p>
