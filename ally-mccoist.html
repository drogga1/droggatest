  <p>[Rangers legend Ally McCoist has baulked at the suggestion that Celtic forward Moussa Dembele is worth £40 million] Celtic will certainly cash in on him, there’s no doubt about that, but I’m not in the £30 million or £40m brigade if you can spare me that. He might develop into a player of that value. I like him a lot, he can finish. He’s got a good physical presence and movement. But realistically he’s not worth that. He’s certainly the most valuable player in the country. He’s young and will naturally progress. He’ll take part in the game more. He’s very much a finisher and concentrates on his finishing which is good but other parts of his game will develop.<br /><br />It says a lot about his mentality that he’s scored in every Old Firm game. It’s difficult to maintain that level of quality of finishing regardless of the opposition. If you look at his goals - particularly in Old Firm games - they’ve all been different. Headers from corners, turning Philippe Senderos at Parkhead. He’s not a one trick pony and I like that about him</p>

  <p>[Steven Gerrard has been warned that even Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho would struggle to make a mark at Ibrox] You could give it to [Pep] Guardiola, [Jose] Mourinho, Steven Gerrard … If [Rangers] don’t get the money to get better quality players, they will continue to finish second behind Celtic. That is the bottom line. I have heard people make comparisons to 1986 when Graeme Souness took his first manager’s job but the only comparison I can see is they are both former Liverpool greats. When Graeme came to Rangers, he played and was absolutely sensational. And he was backed in the transfer market. Two of his first three signings were England captain Terry Butcher and the England goalkeeper Chris Woods. That is where the similarity ends. Put it this way, I don’t think Steven Gerrard will get the financial clout to go out and buy the England captain.</p>

  <p>[<a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> has been told that ‘Glasglow Rangers are a bigger club’ than <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, with Ally McCoist hoping to see reported interest from St James’s Park fended off] Good managers and good coaches get headhunted. I would probably say the same regarding Steven as I would <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>. The timing is not really perfect, I wouldn’t have thought. I think everybody automatically sees Steven go down the same route that Frank looks as though he’s going down himself and that is a return to the club that you became a hero and a legend at.<br /><br />[McCoist added on the potential draw of a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> post] I think Rangers are a bigger club. I think <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> play in a far better league. That’s the way I see it at this moment in time, and you know what I think of North-East football, I absolutely love the people of the North East and I love the football in the North East, but what kind of step would it be for <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>? They’re both massive clubs. They’re actually similar clubs in terms of their support.<br /><br />I think they’ve got absolutely fanatical support. Great support. Best supporters in the country I feel, so I’m not sure where I’d sit on it to be honest with you, but I’m not sure right now it would be a great move for <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, because he certainly has unfinished business at Rangers. I wish <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> all the very best in their search for a new manager, but leave ours! As they would say in Glasgow, ‘Leave oors alane!’</p>
