<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Michael Andersson handed Zlatan Ibrahimovic his debut as a 17-year-old]</b> Zlatan’s skills fit United very well. He always adapts to whatever league he is in. I don’t think him playing until he’s 40 is impossible. He has been lucky not to have any serious injuries in his career. But it’s not impossible he can play for United for another three or five years<br /><br />Zlatan has always wanted to be the centre of attention, the central figure of a club, even from a young age. It’s his personality, the way he is, he wants the pressure. If you look over his history, he does best for clubs where he is the main man. It’s possible United can still win the title, but it will be tough. It’s the sort of challenge Zlatan loves<br /><br />United are starting to play well and, compared to last season, look like another team. Zlatan is responsible for that, along with coach Mourinho. And Zlatan and Paul Pogba also fit so well together. To win the title with United would confirm his reputation - he’s an all-time European great, plus Sweden’s greatest player. And it would end all arguments about him, particularly in Britain where he’s had critics</p>
