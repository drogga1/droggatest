  <p><b>[Narendra Modi stated that the FIFA U-17 World Cup should not remain the final objective as far as the sport is concerned]</b> We have been working very hard on making this a success. This backing from Prime Minster Modi will only strengthen our resolve to make this the most popular and watched World Cup in India and help change Indian football.</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Bieber to perform at Mumbai’s FIFA U17 World Cup Venue]</b> We have discussed in detail with DY Patil how important will this concert be on the preparation for the World Cup. There is no better test than a full stadium, where everything gets stretched, where you can see the people flow movement, all the services tested to its limit. We are happy that DY Patil is hosting this concert, as it is a huge step for the operational readiness of the facility and we hope that the other stadiums can arrange similar high profile events to test the operations. This is key for the success of the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Torunament Director Javier Ceppi tried his best to temper the situation by praising the organisers in doing their best and said they did not lack in effort or motivation]</b> I have been working with our colleagues in Kerala. I can vouch for them, it’s not a lack of professionalism or a lack of interest. We are an international tournmanent and our standards are definitely higher than tournaments that have happened so far. To understand the level of requirements that an international tournament has it takes time.</p>

  <p><b>[Tournament Director Javier Ceppi chimed in saying that the DY Patil Stadium would serve as the benchmark for all the stadiums across the country]</b> This is the best stadium in the country at the present moment. We need to make sure if every other stadium is as good as this stadium. This is the standard. Even after having this standard, they still want to do better. That is commendable.<br /><br />The two grounds in the stadium premises are fantastic. They are here, so that is an ideal scenario with floodlights all ready. The other two are away from the stadium and there is work going on for the other two but we are confident of finishing it well on time</p>

  <p><b>[Guwahati meets with FIFA’s approval]</b> The State Government of Assam has really taken the leadership when it comes to making the World Cup a huge effort in their State. We are already working on all operational and promotional matters to make sure that all the people of Assam and of the neighbouring north-eastern states can enjoy World Cup matches in the north-east.<br /><br />The development in the stadium is very satisfactory and we are sure that the FIFA U-17 World Cup will do justice to the vision of Hon. CM Sarbananda Sonowal of making Guwahati the sports capital of India</p>

  <p><b>[Kolkata, often known as the cradle of Indian football, will hold the final of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup later this year]</b> It is a happy day for me because all the questions about the match schedule will stop being asked. We can finally focus on other things. It has been an extremely complicated process to finalise the schedule to have a World Cup in India - different festivities, weather patterns, different timelines.<br /><br />We know that October is a month of festivities and we want this to be a festival of football<br /><br />Football takes over. This is the first time that India is hosting a FIFA tournament. It will be also the first time an Indian team will play in a FIFA competition. In recognition of the increasing excitement about the beautiful game in India, ‘Football Takes Over’ was the first and most fitting choice as the Official Slogan for the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Kochi’s Jawaharlal Nehru stadium cleared to host eight games]</b> At this point of time, we are happy to say that Kochi is a World Cup venue. There would be eight matches to be played in Kochi. The core infrastructure has been completed and only those which are meant to be completed closer to the tournament are left.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA U-17 World Cup director Javier Ceppi warns Kochi]</b> We want Kochi to show support for all the teams. We haven’t seen it yet. It’s been surprising, we felt that we were gonna sell out completely. Brazil, Spain and Germany are playing in Kochi, we thought we were going to sell out in two hours, like what happened in Calcutta. People need to step up. Brazil vs Spain will be the biggest match played in India. There is nothing bigger than that. This is as big as it gets<br /><br /><b>[Ceppi also confirmed that Kochi has fallen behind other venues when it came to ticket sales]</b> We are a little bit surprised. We thought people would respond much more eagerly. I can tell you that people have responded more eagerly in Calcutta, Guwahati, Delhi. We thought that there will be a little bit more enthusiasm of having a world cup here<br /><br /><b>[Despite the dip in ticket sales, the tournament director stated his pleasure at the face-lift given to the stadium ahead of the World Cup]</b> You can see the difference. Kudos to the greater Kochin development authority, state govt of Kerala. They’ve done a very important work in giving the face-lift that the stadium actually required. I don’t know how you were able to play matches with that amount of people in this stadium and nothing happened. The stadium didn’t have fire. The stadium had structural issues that are now getting corrected. It is more than 80% ready<br /><br />Whatever is not bought before match-day is not bought. We are not some other type of tournaments where we just let people in. We care about people, their safety, security. No ticket sales at the stadium. You don’t have a ticket, don’t come to the stadium.” stated Ceppi. “People will not be allowed in. We will create a further outer perimeter so that people cannot come in. That’s why we’re also closing the shops. We have requested to close the shops.”<br /><br />Tickets will go out fast. I’m hoping all the people will start buying. If it’s not sold out, we may open a ticket store far away from the stadium, down in MG road..nothing close. That’s a 2-3% chance. We have spoken to Kochi police. They also don’t want ticket sales on match-days<br /><br /><b>[Javier Ceppi also admitted a strategic failure in Goa, where the ticket sales were earlier confirmed to be extremely poor]</b> Goa is an interesting case. In Goa, we are now having a different strategy. The online strategy did not work. We know Goans are passionate about football. Closer to the tournament, we will look at an on-ground strategy where people can go to the stadium and buy their tickets. At this point, Calcutta, Guwahati and Delhi are getting more sales</p>

  <p><b>[Minister Arup Biswas ceremoniously handed over the responsibility to the tournament director Javier Ceppi]</b> xWe are formally handing over the responsibility of the stadium to FIFA until the conclusion of the world cup as per rules.<br /><br />The renovation work of the Salt Lake started in February 2015 and after two and a half years’ effort, here we are. We have completed 98 per cent of the work. Some work in the outside part of the stadium and some in the media and VIP tribunes are left which will be completed soon.<br /><br />More than Rs.100 crores have been invested by the state government for the refurbishment of the stadium. The official capacity of the stadium is 80,000 but during the World Cup, keeping in mind the security concerns, the capacity has been reduced to 66,687</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Ceppi mentioned how much FIFA is impressed with the government’s efforts in changing the face of the stadium]</b> I thank the West Bengal government and the PWD for renovating this stadium in a brilliant manner. Everyone knows how it was 2 years back and now look how the stadium looks. From here we take charge of the stadium and will hand it back again on October 29.<br /><br /><b>[On asked if he will rate Salt Lake Stadium higher than others]</b> All the six stadiums are like our kids and it is impossible to choose among them. Of course, special attention was given to this one as the World Cup final will take place in Kolkata. Yuba Bharati gets full marks.</p>
