  <p><b>[Narendra Modi stated that the FIFA U-17 World Cup should not remain the final objective as far as the sport is concerned]</b> We have been working very hard on making this a success. This backing from Prime Minster Modi will only strengthen our resolve to make this the most popular and watched World Cup in India and help change Indian football.</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Bieber to perform at Mumbai’s FIFA U17 World Cup Venue]</b> We have discussed in detail with DY Patil how important will this concert be on the preparation for the World Cup. There is no better test than a full stadium, where everything gets stretched, where you can see the people flow movement, all the services tested to its limit. We are happy that DY Patil is hosting this concert, as it is a huge step for the operational readiness of the facility and we hope that the other stadiums can arrange similar high profile events to test the operations. This is key for the success of the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Torunament Director Javier Ceppi tried his best to temper the situation by praising the organisers in doing their best and said they did not lack in effort or motivation]</b> I have been working with our colleagues in Kerala. I can vouch for them, it’s not a lack of professionalism or a lack of interest. We are an international tournmanent and our standards are definitely higher than tournaments that have happened so far. To understand the level of requirements that an international tournament has it takes time.</p>

  <p><b>[Tournament Director Javier Ceppi chimed in saying that the DY Patil Stadium would serve as the benchmark for all the stadiums across the country]</b> This is the best stadium in the country at the present moment. We need to make sure if every other stadium is as good as this stadium. This is the standard. Even after having this standard, they still want to do better. That is commendable.<br /><br />The two grounds in the stadium premises are fantastic. They are here, so that is an ideal scenario with floodlights all ready. The other two are away from the stadium and there is work going on for the other two but we are confident of finishing it well on time</p>

  <p><b>[Guwahati meets with FIFA’s approval]</b> The State Government of Assam has really taken the leadership when it comes to making the World Cup a huge effort in their State. We are already working on all operational and promotional matters to make sure that all the people of Assam and of the neighbouring north-eastern states can enjoy World Cup matches in the north-east.<br /><br />The development in the stadium is very satisfactory and we are sure that the FIFA U-17 World Cup will do justice to the vision of Hon. CM Sarbananda Sonowal of making Guwahati the sports capital of India</p>

  <p><b>[Kolkata, often known as the cradle of Indian football, will hold the final of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup later this year]</b> It is a happy day for me because all the questions about the match schedule will stop being asked. We can finally focus on other things. It has been an extremely complicated process to finalise the schedule to have a World Cup in India - different festivities, weather patterns, different timelines.<br /><br />We know that October is a month of festivities and we want this to be a festival of football<br /><br />Football takes over. This is the first time that India is hosting a FIFA tournament. It will be also the first time an Indian team will play in a FIFA competition. In recognition of the increasing excitement about the beautiful game in India, ‘Football Takes Over’ was the first and most fitting choice as the Official Slogan for the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Kochi’s Jawaharlal Nehru stadium cleared to host eight games]</b> At this point of time, we are happy to say that Kochi is a World Cup venue. There would be eight matches to be played in Kochi. The core infrastructure has been completed and only those which are meant to be completed closer to the tournament are left.</p>
