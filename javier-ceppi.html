  <p><b>[Justin Bieber to perform at Mumbai’s FIFA U17 World Cup Venue]</b> We have discussed in detail with DY Patil how important will this concert be on the preparation for the World Cup. There is no better test than a full stadium, where everything gets stretched, where you can see the people flow movement, all the services tested to its limit. We are happy that DY Patil is hosting this concert, as it is a huge step for the operational readiness of the facility and we hope that the other stadiums can arrange similar high profile events to test the operations. This is key for the success of the tournament</p>

I can vouch for them, it’s not a lack of professionalism or a lack of interest. We are an international tournmanent and our standards are definitely higher than tournaments that have happened so far. To understand the level of requirements that an international tournament has it takes time.</p>

  <p><b>[Tournament Director Javier Ceppi chimed in saying that the DY Patil Stadium would serve as the benchmark for all the stadiums across the country]</b> This is the best stadium in the country at the present moment. We need to make sure if every other stadium is as good as this stadium. This is the standard. Even after having this standard, they still want to do better. That is commendable.<br /><br />The two grounds in the stadium premises are fantastic. They are here, so that is an ideal scenario with floodlights all ready. The other two are away from the stadium and there is work going on for the other two but we are confident of finishing it well on time</p>

We are already working on all operational and promotional matters to make sure that all the people of Assam and of the neighbouring north-eastern states can enjoy World Cup matches in the north-east.<br /><br />The development in the stadium is very satisfactory and we are sure that the FIFA U-17 World Cup will do justice to the vision of Hon. CM Sarbananda Sonowal of making Guwahati the sports capital of India</p>

  <p><b>[Kolkata, often known as the cradle of Indian football, will hold the final of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup later this year]</b> It is a happy day for me because all the questions about the match schedule will stop being asked. We can finally focus on other things. It has been an extremely complicated process to finalise the schedule to have a World Cup in India - different festivities, weather patterns, different timelines.<br /><br />We know that October is a month of festivities and we want this to be a festival of football<br /><br />Football takes over. This is the first time that India is hosting a FIFA tournament. It will be also the first time an Indian team will play in a FIFA competition. In recognition of the increasing excitement about the beautiful game in India, ‘Football Takes Over’ was the first and most fitting choice as the Official Slogan for the tournament</p>

There would be eight matches to be played in Kochi. The core infrastructure has been completed and only those which are meant to be completed closer to the tournament are left.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA U-17 World Cup director Javier Ceppi warns Kochi]</b> We want Kochi to show support for all the teams. We haven’t seen it yet. It’s been surprising, we felt that we were gonna sell out completely. Brazil, Spain and Germany are playing in Kochi, we thought we were going to sell out in two hours, like what happened in Calcutta. People need to step up. Brazil vs Spain will be the biggest match played in India. There is nothing bigger than that. This is as big as it gets<br /><br /><b>[Ceppi also confirmed that Kochi has fallen behind other venues when it came to ticket sales]</b> We are a little bit surprised. We thought people would respond much more eagerly. I can tell you that people have responded more eagerly in Calcutta, Guwahati, Delhi. We thought that there will be a little bit more enthusiasm of having a world cup here<br /><br /><b>[Despite the dip in ticket sales, the tournament director stated his pleasure at the face-lift given to the stadium ahead of the World Cup]</b> You can see the difference. Kudos to the greater Kochin development authority, state govt of Kerala. They’ve done a very important work in giving the face-lift that the stadium actually required. I don’t know how you were able to play matches with that amount of people in this stadium and nothing happened. The stadium didn’t have fire. The stadium had structural issues that are now getting corrected. It is more than 80% ready<br /><br />Whatever is not bought before match-day is not bought. We are not some other type of tournaments where we just let people in. We care about people, their safety, security. No ticket sales at the stadium. You don’t have a ticket, don’t come to the stadium.” stated Ceppi. “People will not be allowed in. We will create a further outer perimeter so that people cannot come in. That’s why we’re also closing the shops. We have requested to close the shops.”<br /><br />Tickets will go out fast. I’m hoping all the people will start buying. If it’s not sold out, we may open a ticket store far away from the stadium, down in MG road..nothing close. That’s a 2-3% chance. We have spoken to Kochi police. They also don’t want ticket sales on match-days<br /><br /><b>[Javier Ceppi also admitted a strategic failure in Goa, where the ticket sales were earlier confirmed to be extremely poor]</b> Goa is an interesting case. In Goa, we are now having a different strategy. The online strategy did not work. We know Goans are passionate about football. Closer to the tournament, we will look at an on-ground strategy where people can go to the stadium and buy their tickets. At this point, Calcutta, Guwahati and Delhi are getting more sales</p>

  <p><b>[Minister Arup Biswas ceremoniously handed over the responsibility to the tournament director Javier Ceppi]</b> xWe are formally handing over the responsibility of the stadium to FIFA until the conclusion of the world cup as per rules.<br /><br />The renovation work of the Salt Lake started in February 2015 and after two and a half years’ effort, here we are. We have completed 98 per cent of the work. Some work in the outside part of the stadium and some in the media and VIP tribunes are left which will be completed soon.<br /><br />More than Rs.100 crores have been invested by the state government for the refurbishment of the stadium. The official capacity of the stadium is 80,000 but during the World Cup, keeping in mind the security concerns, the capacity has been reduced to 66,687</p>

From here we take charge of the stadium and will hand it back again on October 29.<br /><br /><b>[On asked if he will rate Salt Lake Stadium higher than others]</b> All the six stadiums are like our kids and it is impossible to choose among them. Of course, special attention was given to this one as the World Cup final will take place in Kolkata. Yuba Bharati gets full marks.</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Ceppi says Mission XI Million has been the star of the World Cup]</b> The journey has been good. The most important thing was to get everything done as per requirement and from the feedback that we have, things seem to be in a good position.<br /><br />I will not compare countries. It is very different. India as a country is more of a continent. It has a lot of cultures within the country. You go to different cities and states, and culturally it is very diverse. The languages, food, the weather is different. It’s not fair to compare India with any other country<br /><br />We also don’t compare between venues for the World Cup. There are six venues that have come up to be fit to host a FIFA tournament, which is not easy. The standards are particularly high <b>[to achieve this]</b>. So we believe that all the venues have risen up to the challenge<br /><br />India is a large country. There are a lot of hours of travelling. Again, different places have different cultures, languages and governments in place. I wouldn’t call that a challenge at all. It’s just the way the country is. You just have to adjust and adapt as best as the conditions the country offers. The geographical conditions of the country are obviously not going to change. So that has been the thing that we had to adjust the most but it’s for a good reason. We wanted to spread the tournament to as many geographical areas of the country as possible<br /><br />India is not treating the U17 World Cup as a regular competition. India has realised the value and the importance of hosting a FIFA event. Along with that, there have been a lot of programmes in place, particularly the Mission XI Million that will transform the way how football will be perceived in the country<br /><br />It’s extremely important to get the tournament right. Of course, the tournament is the highlight of the entire process, but it’s not the only angle of hosting the event. The idea and the objective are also to create a lot of attention to football and to bring a lot of people, particularly kids, to watch football and to get an atmosphere and ambience conducive towards the development of the sport in the country<br /><br />Be it ticket sales, the attention received by different stakeholders - media being one of the important ones - I think the objective at least before the tournament has been achieved into generating an atmosphere and infrastructure for football<br /><br />Without the state and central governments, it is not possible to do <b>[host]</b> a tournament, let alone a World Cup. Their contribution and support has been very good. They are the ones who took the responsibility to develop and renovate <b>[existing]</b> infrastructure to a standard that gives us the confidence that a FIFA World Cup can be hosted. The work has been good. If it wouldn’t have gone in a good fashion, we wouldn’t have been here<br /><br />The FIFA U17 World Cup in India is an opportunity to change the mindset regarding football and to make it more accessible or achievable. In that sense, the Mission XI Million has been the star of this whole process<br /><br />It’s not a football training programme. It was not supposed to be one. What we are trying to tell people is extremely simple: That you can actually play football anywhere, in any capacity - two vs. two, five vs. five - that you do not need an 11 vs. 11 to play football; that you can play football on a lawn, mud ground or whatever space that you have. That is a real eye-opener when we go to schools and speak to the school administration systems. It’s like gully cricket and now it’s gully football<br /><br />A couple of balls are given and they just start to play. It doesn’t matter if those spaces look nice or are fit to play a proper game of football or not. How do you start? You start with a kid playing. How did Alexis Sanchez start? He comes from a very depleted background. I’m sure that his first match on a lush green lawn ground was when he was 12 or 13 years old and not before that. That’s how all the great footballers are brought up - they play on the street, barren land or whatever space they have in schools and that has been a mindset change for an umpteen number of schools<br /><br />The first <b>[excuse]</b> that everybody came back to us with was, ‘We don’t have infrastructure’. We asked them ‘What do you consider as infrastructure?’ They said ‘A large football field with regulation size goals’, but when they started looking at the reality, that they don’t actually need that infrastructure, they can use whatever small space they have - that’s when the real change started to happen<br /><br />The academies do a fantastic job of training. We cannot undertake that level of training. We can tell people ‘You should play’. I think that’s the misconception that people must have had. People thought that ‘They are not training the kids properly and that they are not using any academy model’<br /><br />The most important thing now is delivering the U17 World Cup. Until it can deliver this FIFA tournament, the doors for other events will not be open. So the focus should be having full stadiums or having all the operational issues covered before starting to look into anything else. If we don’t deliver the FIFA U17 World Cup correctly, it will be very difficult for other events to come. First set a benchmark and then the benchmark needs to be held<br /><br />It is very simple. It’s a one-liner. This is the single best live football <b>[event]</b> that they would have seen in India by far and beyond. There is no football that has been played live in India that compares even remotely to the level of football they will see. If you are a football fan, you will need to be at the stadium watching the U17 World Cup</p>
