  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Abbie McManus hopes football fans will now be convinced to go to women’s matches on a regular basis after a record crowd for the first professional Manchester derby]</b> Yes, it’s back off the World Cup, but there’s probably a lot of Mancunians out there wanting to paint Manchester either blue or red. Hopefully we can get them down to Leigh Sports Village as well. It’s exciting as a player to look at the crowd and see that many people there. To know there were 31,000 when we expected 20,000 – there must have been a lot of people that bought tickets on the door. The more people there the better for us. I hope that’s not just for the first game. I hope it will happen in the very last game<br /><br /><b>[Man City will be among the contenders for the title but McManus says they have shown in the opening fixture that they can compete with the best sides in England]</b> We created three unbelievable chances and on another day we would have gone in 3-0 up at half-time. This is the second year since United formed a women’s team and look how far we’ve come. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have been formed for five years and they’ve just beaten us 1-0 and we’ve put up a good performance against them. Who knows if we can get further than they did in five years?<br /><br /><b>[McManus, 26, made the move across Manchester from City in the summer and explained that her decision was made to give her more opportunity for England as a centre-back]</b> It was a personal reason for me. I had an England career to think of and I only get selected at centre-half. I’m not a right-back. It was a decision that wasn’t easy to take. I know <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are going to win trophies. Hopefully now we can challenge them and hopefully I can make <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> a better team</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd star Abbie McManus targeting fourth Continental Cup success]</b> When I was at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, the first year, that was our trophy. The feeling of winning that trophy is better than when we won the league because we were the underdogs. I’m happy to say that I think <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will be the underdogs. We are new to the league, we are not meant to pick up silverware this year, but we want that. We want silverware so hopefully we can get the win against Brighton and go into the next round<br /><br />I hate the fact that I am always in the old group now! It is challenging me as a player personally as well. I have now got to help the younger ones, whereas I used to have other people helping me because I was the younger one. It is definitely pushing me on and I think it will help my England career as well, <b>[to be]</b> a little bit more mature, leading by example rather than just following the pack like I was at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.<br /><br />The girls come, we chat, talk football, they ask about my experiences, things like that and it is good. I still don’t look at myself like a leader or anything like that, I’ve just come to a new club, made more friends and I am enjoying my time here. If I can help a younger player who looks up to me … I’m playing centre half at the minute with <a href="james-milner.html">Millie</a> <b>[Turner]</b> so just to talk to her at the back is good for her and good for me that now I am the one that is speaking rather than being the one next to Steph <b>[Houghton]</b> or Jen <b>[Beattie]</b> that was the quiet one, or they were speaking to me.<br /><br />It is definitely building me as a player and hopefully push me on further. A successful cup run can help those young players push on too. It’s a learning curve for sure because they will remember the first one. I remember the first Continental Cup more than anything else, more than I would even say the World Cup, because it is something that <b>[…]</b> I don’t know. We were playing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> <b>[in the final]</b>. We were definitely the underdogs and if we can do that here at Man United, I’m sure the girls will remember it forever</p>
