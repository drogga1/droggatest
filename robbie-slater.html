  <p><b>[Football personality Robbie Slater has slammed Australian FA for failing to appoint a new Socceroos coach less than six months out from the World Cup in Russia]</b> Getting a national coach would be a priority, you would think? Even though it’s 2018 and we’re only six months or so away from the World Cup, <b>[the FFA]</b> couldn’t get a teabag out of a teacup at the moment. They can’t name a national coach. It’s an absolute disgrace and we’re not hearing anything from anyone. Time is running out and in some ways has run out.<br /><br /><b>[Slater believes the FFA won’t find a foreign coach that fits their criteria]</b> I’m hearing that people they are interviewing - some of the names make me shake my head. The coaches that are available are either the ones that are semi-retired or ones that have lost their job because of poor performance. No local Australian coach has been approached or interviewed. <b>[Louis Van Gaal]</b> would be great wouldn’t it? A massive name in world football. He knows a lot about us, doesn’t he? Two of the criteria is you got to know the players and you got to know the culture. There is no overseas coach that can answer yes to both those criteria</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Slater says Sydney FC manager and close friend Graham Arnold is probably out of the picture for the Socceroos]</b> I think Graham Arnold is probably out of the picture now. Time is rolling on. It’s too late now, I feel in a lot of respects, for a local coach. Even if you go in with a local coach, they should be overseas, checking on the player’s form - the World Cup is in June, it’s not that far away in a sporting sense. It’s already too late. We’re into January now. March we’ve got a game against Norway. How farcical is the fact we’ve announced a game against Norway and we’ve got no coach?</p>

  <p><b>[Pundit and ex-Socceroo Robbie Slater didn’t mince his words when it came to criticising the FFA]</b> The farcical pursuit of a national coach is ridiculous and embarrassing. We do not have a national coach. We’ve got a friendly in March, we’ve got a World Cup in six months. Pick a national coach. We’re using consultants, I’m hearing, and I’d like this confirmed, we’re paying money to consultants. I’ve heard of Gerard Houlier, I’ve heard of Andy Roxburgh. Why? What are they going to tell us about what we need? Don’t we have a technical director, Eric Abrams? That’s his job to do that, along with Luke Casserly. These are the faceless men leading us on a farcical pursuit of a national team coach. We need one and we need one now, in fact, we don’t need one now, we needed one a month ago. Ange Postecoglou left in November. It’s not good enough on all levels. FFA, lift your game or change your game</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Slater has hit out at the possibility of the A-League increasing its quota of foreign players moving forward]</b> I respect Bozza and anyone who has their views but I find it a load of bullsh*t. To add more foreigners? You have to be kidding me. In a league where if you look around, the fourth and fifth foreigners in most clubs don’t even play. If you want to bring six foreigners and, god forbid seven, I mean the game at a youth level is already a mess. Does anyone understand where the game has come at a youth level and what we’re producing, or rather not producing, in the last 12 or 13 years? It is absolutely a crime what is going on. Now, the owners need to put their heads together and fix the youth league…but we’re going to have to wait another year for that</p>

  <p><b>[The sad, baffling Lucas Neill mystery]</b> I was having a coffee with Phil Moss <b>[former Central Coast Mariners coach]</b> at the local shops when I saw Lucas in the background. His mum and dad were from the area, but I hadn’t seen him for years. He saw me but he thought I hadn’t seen him. Then he darted right into the Woolworths.<br /><br />I said to Phil: ‘You wouldn’t believe it! I just saw Lucas Neill dart into the shops when he saw me.’<br /><br />I was thinking ‘Why on earth would you do that? What would make him react like that?<br /><br />After a few minutes, I went to the front counter at Woollies pretending to look at something in the shop, to see if I could chat with him. I saw him see me again, then he hid behind the pasta aisle at the end of the shop. He must have left, I didn’t see him<br /><br />It was sad. I just don’t know what his problem is. You can only be so angry for so long, you would think. It’s a shame. We don’t really know (why he’s in hiding). He’s never really spoken about it, and never gone on TV to give his side. It’s like he just drew a line through Australia<br /><br />He had a fantastic career. It probably didn’t end the way wanted it to end, or the way he thought it should have ended. I guess that’s why he had this reaction. The trouble with some former players is they think the game owes them something. But in reality we owe the game everything<br /><br /><b>[Slater revealed he and <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Mark Bosnich</a> had both tried to get in touch with Neill over the years, even trying to get him to appear on a Fox Sports show]</b> We wanted him on Fox Sports, years ago. Me and Bozza tried to reach out, tried to call him. I couldn’t get a hold of him, I think maybe Bozza did. But we couldn’t get him to come on the show</p>
