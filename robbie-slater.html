  <p><b>[Robbie Slater has hit out at the possibility of the A-League increasing its quota of foreign players moving forward]</b> I respect Bozza and anyone who has their views but I find it a load of bullsh*t. To add more foreigners? You have to be kidding me. In a league where if you look around, the fourth and fifth foreigners in most clubs don’t even play. If you want to bring six foreigners and, god forbid seven, I mean the game at a youth level is already a mess. Does anyone understand where the game has come at a youth level and what we’re producing, or rather not producing, in the last 12 or 13 years? It is absolutely a crime what is going on. Now, the owners need to put their heads together and fix the youth league…but we’re going to have to wait another year for that</p>

  <p><b>[The sad, baffling Lucas Neill mystery]</b> I was having a coffee with Phil Moss <b>[former Central Coast Mariners coach]</b> at the local shops when I saw Lucas in the background. His mum and dad were from the area, but I hadn’t seen him for years. He saw me but he thought I hadn’t seen him. Then he darted right into the Woolworths.<br /><br />I said to Phil: ‘You wouldn’t believe it! I just saw Lucas Neill dart into the shops when he saw me.’<br /><br />I was thinking ‘Why on earth would you do that? What would make him react like that?<br /><br />After a few minutes, I went to the front counter at Woollies pretending to look at something in the shop, to see if I could chat with him. I saw him see me again, then he hid behind the pasta aisle at the end of the shop. He must have left, I didn’t see him<br /><br />It was sad. I just don’t know what his problem is. You can only be so angry for so long, you would think. It’s a shame. We don’t really know (why he’s in hiding). He’s never really spoken about it, and never gone on TV to give his side. It’s like he just drew a line through Australia<br /><br />He had a fantastic career. It probably didn’t end the way wanted it to end, or the way he thought it should have ended. I guess that’s why he had this reaction. The trouble with some former players is they think the game owes them something. But in reality we owe the game everything<br /><br /><b>[Slater revealed he and <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Mark Bosnich</a> had both tried to get in touch with Neill over the years, even trying to get him to appear on a Fox Sports show]</b> We wanted him on Fox Sports, years ago. Me and Bozza tried to reach out, tried to call him. I couldn’t get a hold of him, I think maybe Bozza did. But we couldn’t get him to come on the show</p>
