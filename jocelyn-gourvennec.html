<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Malcom]</b> He’s always joyful, vibrant and full of energy, you can see it on a daily basis. He’s the translator for his new Brazilian team-mates! The rumours around him have not affected him at all because, although he’s a young boy, he’s very mature and knows how to be decisive, when you can laugh and when you have to work. He’s always had that in him and he will always have it.<br /><br />I think leaving would be premature for him. He needs to grow to become even stronger. He has immense potential and we think that in the next couple of years he can join a very big club</p>

  <p><b>[On Francois Kamano and the next Thierry Henry]</b> Henry had a different style. Francois is more of a powerful player, but he manages to go past players like Henry used to.</p>

  <p><b>[Guingamp head coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was left struggling to make sense of the triumph, having witnessed three goals and three penalties in the final 30 minutes]</b> We never know what to expect here, they often put up heavy scores and very quickly. With Guingamp or <b>[my former club]</b> Bordeaux, it’s always been complicated here for me. I don’t really know what happened. We managed to get them into trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Why Chelsea, Spurs and Bayern Munich are in race for goalscoring right-back Youcef Atal]</b> He’s an electric player. He was confident after his first goal and he was very difficult to counter.</p>
