<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nubel’s underage coach Marco Cirrincione admitted that it was just chance which led to Nubel becoming a goalkeeper]</b> In preparation for the under-13 season, one of our goalkeepers was surprised that there was so much training. He preferred to play table tennis and that’s why he stopped playing football. Nevertheless, he was the third-highest scorer in our team, with seven goals and six assists. I remember clearly that he changed positions against Verl at 0-0 at half-time. We won 5-0 and Alex even scored two goals<br /><br /><b>[At Schalke, he was initially third choice, behind Ralf Fahrmann and veteran Michael Gspurning, but by the end of the 2015-16 season, he was on the bench]</b> He always stayed cool and didn’t go crazy. In the shadow of Fahrmann, he was able to see how professional football works and then took off himself</p>
