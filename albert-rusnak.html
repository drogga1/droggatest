  <p><b>[On himself]</b> I’m an attacking-minded player, so whatever it is on the field going forward, whether it’s right, left or straight down the middle, I can do a job. I prefer right in the middle, in the attacking midfield position, since they come into touch with the ball the most. I like to play with the ball - I think I’m pretty strong with the ball. I can make the key passes in the game and I can score some goals like I did in Holland.<br /><br />There’s no extra pressure because this is football and one player leaves and another player comes. He’s done an amazing job for Real Salt Lake. All the fans love him and will love him forever, deservedly so. He’s a legend of this club. That’s a great achievement. But I’m coming to this club to also achieve something. I want to win titles like I won in Holland, so I want to help the team in any way that I can. That’s my reason for coming to Real Salt Lake</p>

  <p><b>[On Patrick Vieira]</b> He was my coach for two years and he taught me a lot of stuff and also told me what I needed to work on. When I saw him in the game against NYC, he told me: ‘You finally made a good step in your career,’ with a laughing face. That helped my confidence.<br /><br /><b>[Rusnak said of the Eredivisie]</b> There are guys <b>[at age 16]</b> who are regularly playing. It’s the whole mentality of the Dutch league and it’s a reason why I went there at 19 - to play in a quality league, to get some experience and prepare for the next level<br /><br />The soccer style of the Dutch league is always to play out from the back. It’s about your first touch and about the vision as an attacking player, the passes you make. It’s not always about just getting the ball from A to B. It’s about picking the right choice. There are a few different choices that a player has when he’s on the ball, he can make several decisions. In Holland it was a school on all of that<br /><br />The start <b>[of the season]</b> was a little bit harder. I was new. There were a couple of other new players. It takes a little while to settle in. Then three games into the season we had <b>[the coaching change]</b> and that played a part as well<br /><br /><b>[On Mike Petke]</b> He knows each and every player needs something else on the training field. Each player needs to be spoken to differently. You’ve got different mentalities and also different personalities in a team. I think his handling of that is outstanding. We’ve got one target - that’s to reach the playoffs this year. He’s got us focusing just on that<br /><br />Now people in MLS will have a mark on me and the kind player I am. And I’ll be looking myself to do even better next year. That’s something that a winning mentality, a sportsman, should do - always trying to push himself to a better season than the one before. And I’m not saying it will happen, but that’s what I’ll be aiming for, for sure</p>
