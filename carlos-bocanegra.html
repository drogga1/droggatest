  <p><b>[Atlanta United has signed Brek Shea]</b> We’re pleased to add a player of Brek’s caliber and versatility to the club. He has significant experience, playing numerous years in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, overseas and for the U.S. Men’s National Team, and will be a great addition to our locker room</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United have secured the signing of United States international Emerson Hyndman on loan for the remainder of the season, the MLS side have announced. The Bournemouth midfielder will be eligible to feature for the reigning MLS champions when the league’s secondary transfer window opens July 9]</b> We’re excited to bring a talented young player like Emerson in to bolster our midfield. In addition to his technical, on-the-ball abilities, he performed well in two physically-demanding leagues in the Scottish Premiership and English Championship.</p>

  <p><b>[Former USMNT captain Carlos Bocanegra on Aaron Long]</b> The career path that he’s had to get to where he is is incredible so it’s fun to root for him. I remember seeing him before he had that terrible mullet. He was always a good kid, and comes from a good family, so I couldn’t be happier for the kid because he just kept grinding, kept going, believing in himself. It’s nice to see him with the national team, especially when he captained the country. That was pretty cool.<br /><br />He’s really shined and picked up the position fantastically because he didn’t play it growing up and that’s a difficult position at the higher level because it’s all about reading and instincts and the positional and tactical awareness. So for a kid who didn’t play that growing up in your developmental years when you’re getting into the game, it’s fantastic.<br /><br />He’s hard to beat one on one. The kid just doesn’t stop. I remember a few times when he came back against (Atlanta United), chasing down Josef Martinez or whatever, he makes himself hard to beat. He’s just got that grit and determination</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United traded Julian Gressel to D.C. United on Tuesday]</b> We knew we were going to get absolutely hammered by the fan base. We knew this was coming. But again, with Julian, he’s a great kid and I don’t think this would’ve been a good situation for anyone. Julian would be playing not to get hurt, he’d be worrying about his future. Again, we could’ve made him a bona fide offer and we’d have retained his rights within <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> in perpetuity. It was coming down to a situation where nobody really wanted it to go. There was a solution where we felt we were getting a good return for him. We can utilize those funds and it will go into our greater plan and Julian will get a good situation as well, he gets a resolution and he’s happy<br /><br /><b>[Bocanegra said of Gressel]</b> He’s a fan favorite, that’s not lost on us. We get this, that’s a difficult decision and we understand that the fan base is going to be asking a lot of questions about this. And that’s not something we take lightly. But in this business you’ve got to try and do what’s best for the club and the player as well</p>
