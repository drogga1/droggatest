  <p><b>[Why many talented international players won’t be drafted by MLS teams]</b> The landscape is changing. A lot of the good kids coming up through the academies are being signed to a homegrown contract or they’re signed to a USL team through the club. It’s just the evolution of where we are as a country with this combine and draft.<br /><br />For me, I like to just look at the top players, and afterwards worry about whether they’re foreign or not. With <b>[Julian]</b> Gressel, we thought about it and we had availability with our roster construction. For us, last year he was the most pro-ready guy at that pick, and it ended turning out that he was.<br /><br />I actually think that it wouldn’t be a good thing <b>[to have the draft be filled with Americans]</b> because then it would mean we’re not getting the American kids into the pro game at an earlier age to get them in those environments. I think this is a good sign that you’re not seeing as many American players in this combine and in the draft because they’re going the homegrown and USL route, and they’re in that professional environment at an earlier age</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United has officially landed 18-year-old Ezequiel Barco from Argentina side Independiente]</b> It speaks to the type of club that we’re becoming that Ezequiel chose to sign with our club over several European competitors. As one of the top young players in South America who has been a fixture in the Argentinian youth national team setup, we’re elated that he’s decided to continue his career in Atlanta.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United’s Ezequiel Barco signing the next step in MLS evolution]</b> Credit to the kid - he gave up stuff to come here, he really wanted to be a part of this league. It makes me feel good about our club and about our league, a league of choice, that he knows this is another steppingstone in his career that’s going to help his development and improve him as he goes on and on.<br /><br />He needs to produce. And we need to make sure he lives up to his potential</p>

  <p><b>[On Oliver Shannon]</b> He’s a big boy in the center of the park. He does well when the play is in front of him, he has a good range of passing, but he’s got a great engine. He can play as an 8 and go box to box, or he can kind of clean up in front <b>[of the back line]</b>. Our squad, we’re quite deep, but we don’t have too many players of his physical stature. … He’s not such a young guy, and he looks physically ready for the game right now.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Carmona has left Atlanta United, with the club selling the midfielder to Chilean side Colo-Colo]</b> Carlos was a valuable member of the team, but sometimes life becomes more important than soccer and we have decided to do what’s best for the player and his family. Although, it was never the plan to move him on, we were able to reach an agreement and made the best out of a difficult situation.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United has signed Brek Shea]</b> We’re pleased to add a player of Brek’s caliber and versatility to the club. He has significant experience, playing numerous years in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, overseas and for the U.S. Men’s National Team, and will be a great addition to our locker room</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United have secured the signing of United States international <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a> Hyndman on loan for the remainder of the season, the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side have announced. The <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> midfielder will be eligible to feature for the reigning <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> champions when the league’s secondary transfer window opens July 9]</b> We’re excited to bring a talented young player like <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a> in to bolster our midfield. In addition to his technical, on-the-ball abilities, he performed well in two physically-demanding leagues in the Scottish Premiership and English Championship.</p>

  <p><b>[Former USMNT captain Carlos Bocanegra on <a href="aaron-long.html">Aaron Long</a>]</b> The career path that he’s had to get to where he is is incredible so it’s fun to root for him. I remember seeing him before he had that terrible mullet. He was always a good kid, and comes from a good family, so I couldn’t be happier for the kid because he just kept grinding, kept going, believing in himself. It’s nice to see him with the national team, especially when he captained the country. That was pretty cool.<br /><br />He’s really shined and picked up the position fantastically because he didn’t play it growing up and that’s a difficult position at the higher level because it’s all about reading and instincts and the positional and tactical awareness. So for a kid who didn’t play that growing up in your developmental years when you’re getting into the game, it’s fantastic.<br /><br />He’s hard to beat one on one. The kid just doesn’t stop. I remember a few times when he came back against (Atlanta United), chasing down Josef Martinez or whatever, he makes himself hard to beat. He’s just got that grit and determination</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United traded <a href="julian-gressel.html">Julian Gressel</a> to D.C. United on Tuesday]</b> We knew we were going to get absolutely hammered by the fan base. We knew this was coming. But again, with Julian, he’s a great kid and I don’t think this would’ve been a good situation for anyone. Julian would be playing not to get hurt, he’d be worrying about his future. Again, we could’ve made him a bona fide offer and we’d have retained his rights within <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> in perpetuity. It was coming down to a situation where nobody really wanted it to go. There was a solution where we felt we were getting a good return for him. We can utilize those funds and it will go into our greater plan and Julian will get a good situation as well, he gets a resolution and he’s happy<br /><br /><b>[Bocanegra said of Gressel]</b> He’s a fan favorite, that’s not lost on us. We get this, that’s a difficult decision and we understand that the fan base is going to be asking a lot of questions about this. And that’s not something we take lightly. But in this business you’ve got to try and do what’s best for the club and the player as well</p>
