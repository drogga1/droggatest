<blockquote>
  <p>[Why the Mexican press wants Tuca Ferretti as El Tri manager] He’d be the only way, with his character, for the Mexican national team to once again put the work on the football field above all the sideshows that exist, with recording commercials and being, like we say in Mexico, being divas. A lot of times that’s how Mexican players are.<br /><br />The thing is that at Tigres he doesn’t need to put young players in the team. With Tigres, if he wants to buy a player like Gignac, the directors go out and by him. He has no need thanks to Tigres’ economic power. Tigres is a team that buys players, it’s not a team that develops players like he did at Pumas, at Chivas when he gave a lot of young players their debuts. I think he could do this work, to get the young guys ready for a long process<br /><br />If it’s not Tuca, I simply don’t see anyone in Mexico. I don’t see any other manager with his character, who brings up young players to a good place</p>
