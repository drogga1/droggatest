<blockquote>
  <p>[Nigeria vs South Africa. Bafana Bafana, whose only continental triumph came in 1996, struggled in the group stages but put together an impressive display against Egypt in the last-16, thoroughly deserving their 1-0 victory and leaving coach Stuart Baxter delighted with what he saw] From the first couple of games we weren’t 100% satisfied with our attacking play. The movement around the box was not clear and we had to improve on that. But probably the most important thing was to play a game that I don’t think Egypt expected us to play. They would have expected us, I think, to play deeper. Therefore, I wanted to press higher. And try in that way to surprise them with that game plan. I think we did it very well and I think it surprised them and I think that helped us to get a foothold in the game</p>
