  <p><b>[What has happened to Renato Sanches? Euro 2016 wonderkid suffering third year of misery]</b> I’m not happy here, I work a lot, but I’m not allowed to play. I want to play more, maybe at a different club, I have to worry about that<br /><br /><b>[He also revealed the hardship he endured at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>, where injuries and poor form led to a hugely disappointing loan spell]</b> I was out for months, sitting alone in an apartment in <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> watching it rain all day<br /><br /><b>[He told his immediate dream was no longer to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> I want to be in great shape. I want to play more minutes. I want to keep hearing people around Munich say, ‘That’s the Renato we signed, that’s why we got him’</p>

  <p><b>[The promising midfielder told reporters on the back of a thrilling 5-4 victory for Bayern]</b> It is not my decision. I’m waiting for my opportunity and keep working. Of course, I want to play more. The season has not finished yet. In two months everything is possible but I don’t know<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he is finding it difficult to keep himself motivated on the fringes of the fold]</b> Of course. But this is football, I am waiting. I am not happy<br /><br /><b>[The youngster also revealed that <a href="niko-kovac.html">Kovac</a> has not explained his ongoing absence, saying when asked if the Bayern boss has spoken to him about recent selections]</b> No, he didn’t. But, it is his decision, not mine<br /><br /><b>[He has already said of a possible transfer at the end of the season]</b> I want to play more, maybe at a different club, I have to worry about that</p>

If the best for me is to stay here, I’ll stay - I want to play football<br /><br /><b>[Sanches claims to have received assurances from manager Kovac that he will get his chance]</b> We’ve spoken about everything. We’ve talked about my situation and training. He told me that he’s going to give me and the other players a chance to prove ourselves. Me and the other players, we’re starting from zero. I think he needs me because I’m a good player and the club believes in me</p>

  <p><b>[Sanches reveals Bayern boss <a href="niko-kovac.html">Kovac</a> blocked move to PSG]</b> I had spoken with Antero Henrique <b>[the former sporting director]</b>. He had spoken to my agent, Jorge Mendes. We had a good conversation. Everything was ready. I remember I was at a restaurant when my agent called me. He said to me: ‘Tomorrow you’re flying to Paris.’ I said OK, I went home and packed my bags. And the next day, during training, my coach <b>[Kovac]</b> said to me: ‘You are not leaving!’. I stayed. And I did not play. The next game, he gave me five minutes. It was not enough<br /><br />I lost my place in the national team, I lost my form. My colleagues asked me why I was not playing. However, I was good in training. One of the best. In an interview, <a href="niklas-sule.html">Niklas Sule</a> said: ‘Renato is always the best in training.’ And it was the same again last summer<br /><br /><b>[However, by the time he left, he believes he was good enough to make the grade in Bavaria]</b> I was ready to play at Bayern. My president and my coach knew it. Munich had become my home. But when I saw that things were not changing, I spoke with Jose Fonte <b>[the Lille defender]</b>, <a href="luis-campos.html">Luis Campos</a> <b>[the advisor to the president]</b>. Everyday. We met in Lisbon when I was on vacation. I said, ‘Ok, I want to come to Lille.’ My agent gave me other offers. But my choice was Lille. I felt confident. I felt good. I spoke with the coach, the president. It confirmed my desire. Besides, Lille is not a small club. We play against good teams like Marseille, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, Paris. If you do the job well, you play well, you will get recognition. But what I wanted was to play, to be happy again</p>
