  <p><b>[What has happened to Renato Sanches? Portugal’s €35m wonderkid]</b> My relationship with Carlo Ancelotti is very good. He speaks with me, explains things, tells me what I need to improve. Being at Bayern is going to help me a lot. Every day I spend here I feel I am a better player.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich’s Renato Sanches has put links to Manchester United to one side and apologised for a tasteless video posted on social media]</b> There are tasty and tasteless jokes. Because of the video released today, I must apologise not only for the bad taste, but also for the unpardonable and ill-considered behaviour. It is not even an excuse that the whole thing happened in a small circle of friends and during the holidays.<br /><br />Through my background, I have learned to appreciate the work we have earned and I can only confirm that my action was totally wrong. I guarantee that I am not like that, I will always fight on to be an example of professionalism, humility, character and dignity. It will serve me as a lesson for the future!</p>

  <p><b>[Why AC Milan and not Man Utd are the perfect club for Renato Sanches]</b> Personally, I am not satisfied with my first year in Munich. Of course, I’d like to play more. That’s why I would like to go to a club that can give me more playing time.<br /><br />AC Milan is an interesting option. If the opportunity arises and the clubs can agree, I would like to see them. I am now on the China tour with FC Bayern, but after that we will get together in Munich and hopefully find a solution. I’m young and I have to play a lot. I think the chance to do so is greater in Milan than in Munich</p>

  <p><b>[Renato Sanches has said he still has ambitions of winning the Ballon d’Or]</b> My first season at Bayern wasn’t ideal. I know that. I heard what people were saying about me. Football in Munich, and in Germany as a whole, is so different. In Portugal, I would just run and run and run because I had the technical ability and awareness to make up for any fatigue. In Germany, you can run, but the game is so fast that it has to be coordinated otherwise you’ll get caught out of position. Everything was just… different. The worst part was that, as hard as I tried, I just couldn’t find my game. I went to Swansea in 2017 because I needed to play. I needed minutes. I wanted to make sure the national team saw me playing a lot in a strong league so they could select me for the World Cup. But in Wales… it’s just like everything went wrong. <b>[But]</b> last summer, playing with Bayern again, I feel like I began to find my game. I had these big goals after we won the Euros. I wanted to win the Ballon d’Or, win all these medals and trophies. And I still have those ambitions.<br /><br />Now when I picture my future, <b>[the Ballon d’Or]</b> comes after my new dreams. I want to be in great shape. I want to play more minutes. I want to keep hearing people around Munich say, ‘That’s the Renato we signed, that’s why we got him’. I feel like, with time, I’ll get there. This season has been getting better for us, and for me. I know we can keep improving, and I know that I’m capable of much more. My journey hasn’t been simple. But it’s not over. Not even close</p>

To play is what I love. I do my best in every training session. The coach knows that, my team-mates too. I always have to be ready. I’ll do my best for those five minutes. I have the self-confidence. And I’m playing well if I get the chance.<br /><br />It’s tough right now. But I still have 15 years left of my career. The future can be good. I do not know yet. We will see what is best for me.

I love football and just want to be used more often.<br /><br /><b>[He revealed that Kovac has not yet spoken to him about the club’s plans for 2019-20]</b> We have not talked yet.

Whether it was only for the summer break or forever, I do not know at the moment. I want to play more. I do not know if it makes sense to try again.
