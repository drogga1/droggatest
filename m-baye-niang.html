  <p><b>[Rennes forward M’baye Niang has offered advice to Eduardo Camavinga who has been linked with a move to Real Madrid]</b> The advice I have to give him because he seems to be a guy with his head on his shoulders, I know his parents, who know where they want to go, is to make the right choices.<br /><br />I talked about it with him, I won’t talk about it here, but I already talked with him, that in life it is better to make the right choices than to go too fast. Because at some point, you have requests where you say to yourself: ‘How am I going to refuse them if guys like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> or <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> call?’ That’s when you really have to ask yourself and say, ‘What are these people going to bring me?’<br /><br />The Rennes coach brought you something, and if you leave, this club will bring you much more, it will make you grow. I told him to make the right choices, to talk to his representatives, to his parents, to watch young people his age in these clubs. His parents know what they want, this is the most important. You really have to take this seriously because you can pay for the wrong choices</p>
