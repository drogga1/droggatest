<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why the Mexican press wants Tuca Ferretti as El Tri manager]</b> The Mexican federation is run in a different way than any other in the world. It’s a unique federation. There are 16 owners who have a vote, they give their opinion. So, to really take over the Mexican national team you have to adapt to Mexican soccer. There are strange circumstances. The league hardly supports the Mexican player - if at all. So, to be the manager of the Mexican national team, you’ve got to know the structure of Mexican soccer. Tuca knows it well. He’s a respected manager, they know him, he knows them and he knows what Mexican soccer is. This is the most important thing.<br /><br />Unlike other managers in the past, the manager now has to put together this national team. A lot of guys who were in Russia aren’t going to be here anymore. You’re going to have to take 60 percent new players. That’s where Tuca has one of his biggest virtues, he’s really good with young players, helping them, teaching them. I think that’s why he can be the guy<br /><br />I think we’re doing it wrong if we go for a big showy manager. I think it would be a mistake to go with a big-time manager instead of someone who perfectly knows the structure of Mexican soccer</p>
