  <p><b>[Mathieu Flamini Happy To Remain At <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> I would like to remain at Milan. The season and its fixtures are not easy for anyone. There are still six matches to go, and we will give it our best to win</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> midfielder Mathieu Flamini apologised to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s Vedran Corluka for his two-footed tackle]</b> I went to the Totenham dressing rooms to see the physical condition of Corluka and to apologise. It is a shame that we lost, as we had a good second-half. Now, we must go to London to win. We can do so away from home, as we created many scoring occasions. We deserved to win based on our second-half performance</p>

However, now we have <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, and this will be a difficult game, even though the Scudetto will not be decided. We have to win to stay top</p>

  <p><b>[Mathieu Flamini says reports he has €30 billion in his bank account are inaccurate]</b> Well, it’s important to rectify things. Contrary to what I read, I do not have €30billion in my bank account. And this sum does not correspond to the valuation of my company, GF Biochemicals. In fact, <b>[€30billion]</b> is the total value of the market we want to ‘attack’ with the new technologies we have developed in recent years. There was a misunderstanding. It’s as if we had given a single restaurant the value of the entire catering market in France<br /><br /><b>[Asked directly if he is a billionaire]</b> Oh no, not at all. I’m sorry about this story because I did not go into this business to make money</p>
