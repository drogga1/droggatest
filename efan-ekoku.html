  <p><b>[Efan Ekoku On Nigeria’s Lucky World Cup Qualification]</b> I thought we would win, but I thought Tunisia would win as well. I think the major thing was luck, in the end, because these qualifying performances haven’t been any greater than they were certainly in 2006 and 2002 when we failed to qualify. In terms of real strength, quality and depth, I don’t think this squad - or any squad since 1998 - has been anywhere near the team between ‘92 and ‘96. The consistency has not been there<br /><br />There was a time when there was a group of very good Nigerian players who were reaching a certain age when they were just about to be reaching their prime, who were all very hungry, and who had not had the chance to make a breakthrough at club level<br /><br />You can almost compare it to Man United, who got six or seven great players through their youth team in the early to mid-90s, and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> now. It’s not happened since, and they’re not doing anything different, it’s just a large slice of luck. Of course they have to be good enough, and determined enough<br /><br />I think it’s more a mental problem than anything else. Nigerian players were playing at some of the big clubs in the early to mid-90s. Two players at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Sporting and more - it doesn’t get much bigger than that<br /><br />The pressure now from clubs is far greater than it was then, especially when considering an emerging nation - like Nigeria was in 1994 - with their first World Cup. Everybody was so desperate to be part of the squad, so for that group of players, the national team was the gateway to becoming a big star for one of the big clubs<br /><br />Now the clubs - in terms of Champions League and Europa League matches - have almost superceded many of the big nations, as you could argue some of them have better teams than some of the big nations<br /><br />Maybe the players’ mentality has changed, they’re getting much more money at a far earlier age much easier than they were 15 or 20 years ago. Still, the most determined players will always be the best. Each player individually has to find a way to marry the two together<br /><br />I don’t think the African players - or footballers in general - are any better than they were 15 or 20 years ago, we’re just seeing more leaving the continent, and it’s become more glitzy with better worldwide coverage. The first year the Premiership formed, there were maybe three or four African players, now there are perhaps 30, so people think it’s gotten much better, but I’m not sure that’s the case<br /><br />There have been lots of players in Belgium and in France for the last 25 years. Look back to 1990 or so, there were one or two players playing for big clubs. <a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a> was one of the best players in the world in the early 1990s. There were players in the mid-80s who, if given the opportunity, could have played for <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> or Real Madrid<br /><br />All the big clubs have got bigger scouting networks now. The French and Belgians maintained their presence more in west Africa over the last 15 and 20 years. As a result, they got first option on players from places such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana, to a lesser extent Togo and Senegal as well. They were the frontrunners, because after colonising those countries, they continued to lead social developments and give more back than certain other countries did, from that they got the opportunity to use some of the talent that was there<br /><br />Since then, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has seen what’s there and, with the amount of money they have, are able to now view Africa as a great resource, though due to work permit regulations, many of the players are still going through France, Belgium, through Holland as well, and eventually they find their way to the likes of Spain, Italy and England</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a> striker Efan Ekoku feels that Canaries forward Grant Holt has the quality to succeed in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after helping his side secure promotion with 21 league goals last term]</b> It’s certainly possible because he’s a goalscorer. He did well in the last campaign and he’s a good all-round player; strong with his back to goal, he scores a variety of goals and he’s a big, strong, powerful guy so he could do well if he gets the service<br /><br /><b>[Despite praising the former <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> man, Ekoku did concede that he will face a tough time in getting the better of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> defenders]</b> It’s not going to be easy because he’s going to be up against defenders that are that little bit quicker and stronger so there’s that little bit of frustration sometimes when you know you’re playing well but you’re still not quite able to carve out opportunities.<br /><br />Strikers coming up from the lower leagues are reliant on their team-mates even more, so it’s even more important to have a good supply line which I’m sure <b>[<a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> manager]</b> <a href="paul-lambert.html">Paul Lambert</a> will be working on.<br /><br />If you get chances in the first couple of games then you just have to take them, it gives you that instant confidence, get yourself rolling and hopefully drag your team-mates along with you<br /><br /><b>[Lambert’s men are odds-on favourites to return to the Championship next season and Ekoku is realistic about his former club’s chances of avoiding the trap door]</b> It’s going to be a tough one, they’ve been out of the top flight for a long time now. I wouldn’t say a lot has changed <b>[since <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> were last in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in 2005]</b> but the clubs that they were close to then competitively such as <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> and Bolton have been able to grow a lot stronger and have been fixtures in that time. A new powerbase has broadened and strengthened in the league so you’re playing catch up with them, never mind the big teams.<br /><br />It’ll be a big challenge on and off the field and a lot of good work will need to be done between now and pre-season, and some more good players will need to be brought in, but the fans and the players will look forward to it and it’s exciting times at the club at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Despite admitting that the side from East Anglia face a tough task, the 44-year-old believes that last season’s Championship winners, QPR, are under more pressure to succeed due to the spending power of those in charge at Loftus Road]</b> I think there’s a lot less pressure on <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> and <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> to perform compared to QPR who have lots of money at their disposal. <a href="neil-warnock.html">Neil Warnock</a>’s got a tough job to not only please the fans but more importantly to please the owners
<br /><br />They’ve been a little trigger happy in the last couple of seasons and he has lost an ally in Amit Bhatia <b>[former QPR vice-chairman]</b> so his position has been weakened in the last few weeks
<br /><br />He <b>[Warnock]</b> has got a few players who haven’t quite made the grade at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> level so he’s got a big job on in bringing some quality players who can perform solidly. That won’t be easy because people know QPR have got lots of money and you don’t want any mercenary figures who are just coming for a big wage. <a href="neil-warnock.html">Warnock</a> apparently wants to bring in seven or eight players to rotate his squad but he’s got to be wary not to disrupt the team spirit within the squad by doing that
<br /><br />I feel <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>, similarly to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, will look to keep most of their money in their pocket and wait to see how they’re going in January but unfortunately sometimes you’re so far behind at that point that you can’t bring in the players to make a difference because they can see that you’re going down to the Championship again
<br /><br />It’s going to be difficult for all of the promoted sides to win lots of games but I think that <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> and <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> will at least do as well as QPR</p>
