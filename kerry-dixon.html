<blockquote>
  <p>[Kerry Dixon has backed Antonio Conte’s attempt to shake up his forward line in January] It makes sense to me. Batshuayi was bought by Chelsea with a pretty hefty price tag and for a striker of that ilk, you would expect a certain amount of games which, due to the form of Diego Costa, he hasn’t been able to achieve that. I fully understand - If they do put him out [on loan] for game time. Llorente is somebody that Conte can say, ‘I have worked with him before.’ He would come in and be a squad player and be capable of doing a job for us, if indeed Diego Costa was injured or suspended. The downside to Llorente is we haven’t seen much of him. We haven’t seen much, really, of him doing well and having the pressures of coming in and doing well in the Premier League. Fighting for titles, but we will see and if it does happen we have to go with what Conte is saying. If Diego Costa stays fit, I can’t see him playing too many games.<br /><br />[He thinks that Batshuayi could be a good option for West Ham] Chelsea [could leave an] option to bring him back in on short notice and it would possibly be written in [the deal], if indeed it could be. He came in for that hefty price tag and if Chelsea decide he isn’t what they need for the future, and he hasn’t played any games then his price would go down. If he goes to West Ham and proves he can score in the Premier League then I think his value on the transfer market, if indeed Chelsea were to sell, would at least be the equivalent of what we bought him for. Or it could be slightly enhanced, if he does really well so I can fully understand why they would think about the move, because otherwise they would have a player whose price will have dropped without even playing too many games</p>
