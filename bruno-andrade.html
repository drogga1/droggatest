  <p><b>[On Ederson]</b> Benfica always believed in him, but Julio Cesar was right there, on a huge salary. But then an injury saw Ederson thrown into the firing line vs Sporting … Julio Cesar is now on the bench. Last season he played only the final stages now he is an absolute starter. The press likes him very much, every newspaper here is now discussing whether he will be sold for more than €40 million and whether he will join Manchester City or Barcelona.<br /><br />I like Weverton and Alisson very much, but I think Ederson deserved to be the starter. Alisson is a reserve in Rome, Weverton is great at Atletico-PR, he’s a very good goalkeeper, but Ederson is the future</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Andrade on <a href="pablo-mari.html">Pablo Mari</a>]</b> He’s not very fast, but it makes up for it with his good positioning. He has good technique and does well with aerial balls. Pablo had a great season with <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a>. Defensively he helped improve them a lot and he deserves a lot of credit. The fans loved him.<br /><br />He can slot in where David <b>[Luiz]</b> is playing now as the left-sided centre-back. Ideally he would have a <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a> type of player alongside that has good recovery skills, like he did with Caio at <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a>. He could be great with William <a href="william-saliba.html">Saliba</a> next season</p>
