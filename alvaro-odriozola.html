  <p><b>[Alvaro Odriozola has put his lack of progress at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> down to a collarbone injury he suffered last year]</b> After the collarbone fracture I suffered in April last year I wasn’t the same player I was before because I spent three months without training, because I wasn’t even allowed to run. I just wasn’t in my best condition so that I could play the way I like to play. I have to be very honest and I feel Zidane’s trust, so I have no doubts that my time will come. I’ve had some good performances and my main problem has been my lack of consistency. Fullbacks rely a lot on their physical skills and even more so now in the modern era of football. This consistency in minutes gives you better condition and improves your confidence so you can perform at your highest level.<br /><br />I told <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> first because he had to be the first person to know. I talked a lot with him and thought about what was best for me at the time. Coach didn’t want me to leave but he understood and that’s why I have to thank him. I can only say good things about <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I’m only thinking about Bayern until the end of this season. When it ends, I’ll have to talk with coach <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> to know what he thinks about me but I must insist, I feel his respect and support<br /><br /><b>[When asked if Madrid’s season should be seen as a failure]</b> Not at all, they still have every chance to win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and they still have to play the return leg at the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a>. We know how dangerous <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Odriozola revealed <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> wanted him to stay at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> instead of joining <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> on loan]</b> I have contact with players and club employees and even with the doctors. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is focused. When it came to talk about the departure I had several conversation with him and he showed me his support in private when Bayern were interested. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> did not want me to leave Madrid. It is appreciated that a figure like his thought more about me than himself. He is a great coach and a great person<br /><br />I dreamed of being a footballer. I have played for Real, I belong to Madrid and I am on loan at Bayern. Among my dreams is to succeed in Madrid. I really like to dream. I have fulfilled almost all my dreams and among those I have left is to succeed in Madrid<br /><br />After the collarbone fracture I suffered in April last year I wasn’t the same player I was before because I spent three months without training, because I wasn’t even allowed to run.
