  <p><b>[Stuttgart head coach Hannes Wolf says Julian Green needs more match practice following his move from Bayern Munich]</b> Julian Green had a couple of good situations in his first game for us. It was clear to see that he has distinct qualities and that he can help us further.<br /><br />He certainly still needs some match practice, but he’ll get that over the next few days and weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Stuttgart’s head coach Hannes Wolf, meanwhile, has supported the decision to release Grosskreutz, insisting the club had no choice]</b> After the incidents, the only logical step is the ending of the collaboration with Kevin. This is not a simple situation for us all. Nevertheless, it is important now that we shape the immediate future for VfB and concentrate as quickly as possible on the difficult game in Braunschweig.</p>

  <p><b>[Genk head coach Hannes Wolf discusses Belgian Pro League cancellation]</b> From a sporting point of view, it is a pity because we still wanted to attack the European places. In the overall context, this is a very small problem, because the only thing that matters is that we can all say at some point that we have weathered it all well. I wish the best for football, but above all for the many other areas of life affected<br /><br /><b>[Wolf added on how Genk have dealt with the coronavirus crisis]</b> It is difficult because we have to look for the best among many bad solutions. We sent all the players who could go home to their families. However, this was not possible for our boys from Ghana, Nigeria, Colombia, Brazil, Australia, Japan and the Ivory Coast. Imagine, a 21-year-old who lives on another continent separately from his family and has to do without social contacts. This is far from easy. We are taking care of them as best we can, we have already started individual training again</p>
