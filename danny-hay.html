  <p><b>[New Zealand U-17 head coach Danny Hay speaking about James McGarry, who missed a penalty for the Young All Whites before conceding a spot-kick, which Brazil converted to advance to the Chile 2015 quarter-finals at New Zealand’s expense]</b> It takes courage to take a penalty at a World Cup and the fact that he missed is just unfortunate. What’s more, I think he had a great game overall and a great tournament. He’s been one of our key figures and he should go away with his head held high. Having been a footballer, his dad will be able to guide him. He’ll be surrounded by people who know what it’s all about and love him. New Zealand is a small country where we all look out for one another. Footballers don’t grow on trees, so we take care of our talented players. James is one of them</p>

  <p><b>[New Zealand are all set for the Under-17 World Cup in India as the All Whites coach Danny Hay has named his final 21-member squad on Thursday]</b> This group has done that and I have been impressed by the squad’s character both in our qualifiers and in our training camps as we build towards this tournament.<br /><br />The message is clear to all of these young lads; playing for New Zealand is not a right, it is a privilege. It is something you have to earn and work hard for. The under-17s are the first cab off the rank in international football, so this group of players is very excited about going to a World Cup and seeing what they can do. We have a very balanced squad<br /><br />We have good players right across the park and more so than other age group teams we have some real quality going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Preparations ahead of the mega-event]</b> These guys have the chance to go to a World Cup. These sorts of opportunities are few and far between for young New Zealand players. We don’t get to experience true international football and playing against world-class opposition too often and we have a group of top young men who are outstanding characters so we are looking forward to getting them up there to see what they can achieve.</p>

  <p><b>[New Zealand’s Danny Hay hoping for good outing against Turkey]</b> The practice matches <b>[versus Brazil and England in Mumbai]</b> were huge for us. I think we found a lot about ourselves, we found out strengths and weaknesses in terms of our structure and gameplan. No disrespect to OFC qualification, but the level of competition and players that we have come up against, <b>[on being compared]</b> to these two build-up matches, the level was very, very huge. So, it was a massive learning curve for the team.<br /><br />If you look at the record of FIFA events which New Zealand team has been involved in, the first game has always been a struggle because we simply do not get the opportunity often enough to play against world-class opposition.<br /><br />If you look at some of the odds that betting agencies out there have put up, we have got no chance to beat Turkey. We have watched a lot of footage of them and their <b>[Turkey’s]</b> qualification campaign in the UEFA Euro U17 Championship. We are just preparing ‘us’ and just making sure that our performance is good<br /><br />The pitch is slightly different to what both teams have played on. With cricket pitches you feel it is quite firm through the middle area and softer out-wide. However, the players had 45 minutes on the pitch yesterday, so they have got a feel of it. The reality is that the surface is very, very good and it won’t affect the game. Hopefully, the conditions are favourable and not too hot</p>
