  <p><b>[Martin Skrtel has opened up on his time in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has the best coach in the world and the best players in their respective positions which include <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>. These are special players, and beyond that, they are the type of players that fight with their all for the club. When talented players put their all on the pitch, success follows and this makes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> special.<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is a very special manager and he’s a master at motivating people. He always demands 100 per cent from his players. His matchday meetings and style of speaking are very special. But he especially talks positively to his players after games, describing the mistakes they made without hurting their feelings. These details make him who he is. This is why players want to give their all for Klopp<br /><br /><b>[When pressed on who is the better manager between <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> Well, I’m a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan so my choice is Klopp<br /><br />Who was the most difficult player I ever faced? It would be wrong to point out a single one but I have played against the likes of <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> and <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>. But I must say that I played against <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> when he was in his prime. It was very difficult to defend against <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> due to his speed, strength and stamina as well as his instincts in the box</p>
