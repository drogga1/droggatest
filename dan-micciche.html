  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho has been backed to become a Neymar-type player for England]</b> Provided he doesn’t become restricted he could be our Neymar-type player - in terms of being unpredictable, playing on that left-hand side. And he’s flamboyant, entertaining to watch. But like Neymar, he’s effective with it. In most games he’ll create something - it’s not a beauty contest. He’s not on the pitch flicking it over someone’s head for the sake of it. What he brings to the table are ball skills - being able to play out of tight areas in a way where he can beat a player rather than having to pass it and he can do that a variety of ways. He can run with the ball at speed and go both sides. Even though he’s right-footed, when he’s dribbling at people on that left side he can actually go inside or outside and that makes him very difficult to defend against.<br /><br />First of all his mentality is strong - he’s gone from Watford to Man City, so moving up north - and then had the mentality to move to another country. He’s travelled the world with club and country - that takes a lot of discipline, sacrifice. And he’s delivered on every stage he’s been put on, including now in Germany</p>
