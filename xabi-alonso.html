But above all, he talks about teaching yourself when facing matches, preparing psychologically to be able to play any game. When you are at the top level, you are automatically ready to approach any game accordingly. He has said that since he came here (Real Madrid), and it is something that has stayed with me, because it is very important at this level of football. Every game is practically an obligation for us to win</p>

During my time at the club we didn’t have much success at Old Trafford but a win there would not only mean everything to the fans, but give Liverpool the real belief they have what it takes to win the title this season.<br /><br />I respect him <b>[Klopp]</b> a lot for the way he has embraced the Liverpool culture - from the start he seemed to understand just what the job meant. He understands the hunger the fans have, but also he conducts himself with style and dignity. The Premier League has never been more competitive - but I really think the glory days of Liverpool Football Club could be very close again</p>

  <p><b>[Scoring goals from inside his own half. Humble Xabi Alonso should go down as a midfield great]</b> Where is the risk in <b>[shooting from that far out]</b>? There is no risk. If the shot does not result in a goal, it does not matter, because nobody expects me to score. In these situations, only the goalkeeper looks stupid. I don’t try to do things that might make me look stupid, because the risk is there. How many times have you seen me run into the box with the ball, dribbling past players? It’s uncommon because it’s not my game; it’s not my thing.<br /><br />At Liverpool, I used to read the matchday programme and you’d read an interview with a lad from the youth team. They’d ask: age, heroes, strong points, etc. He’d reply: ‘Shooting and tackling’. I can’t get into my head that football development would educate tackling as a quality, something to learn, to teach, a characteristic of your play. How can that be a way of seeing the game? I just don’t understand football in those terms</p>

The sensation I had today was a mix of emotion, nostalgia, melancholy and sadness, but at the same time happiness, it´s a lot of stuff and I don´t know how to process it.<br /><br />I accept I am going to miss playing because it’s such an important part in my life. It’s going to be difficult to fill that gap. Life goes on. New challenges for me, it’s time to try it. It’s a beautiful feeling. These memories will stay in our mind forever. I remember playing with my dad, and my kids will remember this as well<br /><br />The future is good, the future is bright.

We all remember his match <b>[against Barcelona]</b> in the Nou Camp in the Champions League in 2007. That day he became the player that all coaches want to have.<br /><br />Since our years in Liverpool and later in Madrid, we became inseparable, because Alvaro offers you his unconditional friendship. He never cared what they say, but he has always been faithful to his convictions. He has never hesitated to defend what he believes and that is why I admire him so much. Now a new stage is opening in his life, but with his head. For all these things I will always love you on my team. Both professionally as in life.</p>

  <p><b>[Naby Keita has the right mindset to be a success under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool]</b> He’s a big personality.

So <b>[he’s a]</b> good signing. He will have to adapt to the idea <b>[of Klopp’s philosophy]</b>, but I don’t think that he will have many problems because he’s a great player and very complete. <b>[Under]</b> Jurgen you need to do <b>[play like]</b> ‘bang, bang, bang’ and if he gets it, he will do well. <b>[I see him as]</b> An eight.

He’s able to take that step forwards, not backwards to make that pressure a bit higher. The way he connects with the three players up front, they play very direct and the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is playing is the Jurgen way - the way they played at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> with him and the way they play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> now</p>
