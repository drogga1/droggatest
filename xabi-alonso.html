  <p><b>[on Jose Mourinho]</b> Apart from the knowledge of the game he has, he masters many elements in terms of tactical variations, facing games, and he does that very well. But above all, he talks about teaching yourself when facing matches, preparing psychologically to be able to play any game. When you are at the top level, you are automatically ready to approach any game accordingly. He has said that since he came here (Real Madrid), and it is something that has stayed with me, because it is very important at this level of football. Every game is practically an obligation for us to win</p>

To win two, three times in a row is unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if he could see himself back on Merseyside at some stage]</b> Well at the moment they have an absolutely fantastic manager and we all as Liverpool fans are thrilled with Jurgen Klopp, with what he’s doing. You could feel he was the man because of the way he embraced the Liverpool culture, the way he connected with the fans - you could see that he could make a great job. Even the best expectations he has fulfilled. He’s the man at the moment. Watching the team lifting the Champions League and watching the fans enjoy it as much as we did in 2005, it brought back a lot of memories. We <b>[some of the 2005 team]</b> were in the stadium, old team-mates gathering together again, Stevie Gerrard, Jerzy Dudek, Sami Hyypia, we were together celebrating what they have achieved this year. It was really emotional. You know how special Liverpool is, ‘once a red always a red’ - and that’s not a slogan, that’s not a logo, it’s real and we share that belonging. Our generation that have been playing in the Champions League for many years, we’re almost taking a step back and taking steps into management. It’s part of the cycle of football but for me it’s great to follow Stevie, to follow Mikel Arteta, to follow Frank Lampard - what he’s doing and so many young managers that are already there<br /><br />I support Mikel Arteta and Pep Guardiola a lot but my feelings are not shared at the moment. I am a Liverpool fan. Last season it was phenomenal, the race that both teams had. What City did, what Liverpool did, it’s going to be tough to repeat but they have the project that is stable, they know what they want but the Premier League is tough. It’s still early days, but why not? Jordan Henderson has become a figure in the changing room. I think he’s so respected, so important for his team-mates - that’s the sense I get from watching in the stands. For the way they play it’s very important, the energy he has. He’s able to take that step forwards, not backwards to make that pressure a bit higher. The way he connects with the three players up front, they play very direct and the way Liverpool is playing is the Jurgen way - the way they played at Dortmund with him and the way they play at Liverpool now</p>

He has a relentless natural enthusiasm. Football seasons are long but right until the very end, Pep never seemed to be tired. He was alert, always ready.

But then I got caught up in the match. It’s like an itch and then you say: ‘F</em></strong>, I like this!. You see that day after day, with the repletion, the explanation, the corrections, everything you tell them, they begin to understand little by little. That’s it, being a coach<br /><br />Once I retired, I really that I would take the step into dugout and I believed the words of Johan Cruyff: ‘The most beautiful thing is to play football, the second best thing is to coach.’<br /><br />Do I have a trademark? No. What’s important is what my players feel, that’s what I tell them. If I feel something but my players don’t, my ideas are useless, I have to change and be at their service. Having experienced different leagues, it allows me to adapt quickly. So my team is in the Segunda B but I easily immersed myself in it. If, in the future, I have to go elsewhere, I can adapt quickly, but I’m not in a hurry<br /><br />What I want is to be able to choose where I coach. And I like to coach here. I want to take steps naturally and not force them. These first steps in San Sebastian, my home, where I started my playing career, it makes sense for me<br /><br /><b>[He has revealed the man he sees as the ideal coach]</b> He has to be both a connoisseur of the game and an expert in management. Who has both today? <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. And I don’t just say that because I played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>! He has charisma. You see his relationship with his players at the end of matches. The strong emotional connection he has with his players also comes from the link he has created with the club. Having this is gold for a coach. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> also knows how to do that, like <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> and others. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has impressed me by his ability to read matches and his ability to react when the course of the game requires it.</b></p>
