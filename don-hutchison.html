I think <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> anywhere in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be a good fit. I’ve always liked him, I think he’s one of the quickest out there, he knows where the back of the net is. He’s only young as well, plays with high energy, so I think he would be sensational for the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Don Hutchison says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are greedy and want the lot!]</b> The standards are there for them. I keep saying about the Holy Grail, it’s what they want. They are desperate for it <b>[the <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title]</b>. In my opinion, they have got it. City are nowhere near it, they can’t come back, and I think the distance will get bigger between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> as well. City have got to worry about overtaking <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> before they can even think about getting anywhere near <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Eyes will then be drawn towards the Champions League in February. I wouldn’t have thought they are looking at it just yet, but they have a couple of big games against <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> and they will try and defend the trophy. I think they want the lot. I think they are greedy for it</p>

  <p><b>[former Reds midfielder Don Hutchison says Salah is sometimes so bad it’s untrue]</b> They’re the same age but it’s <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> that I watch every single week, and his numbers are astonishing don’t get me wrong and you can’t take that away from <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, but when we were talking about the Champions League just before the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> game, you watch <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and the guy does genius things but he does the most basic things so bad it’s untrue.<br /><br />He can’t pass a ball five yards, he seems to keep playing this ball where he tries to nutmeg everyone from whatever side he’s on, if he’s coming off the right flank onto his left, tries to play it to a striker through a body of players that’s never, ever on.<br /><br />And you watch him and go: ‘Surely this has been coached, surely <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and his coaching staff have tried to coach <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>,’ and he does the basic things really badly, yet his numbers are frightening and he scores a ridiculous amount of goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League.<br /><br />So I would disagree, I think if you’re going to sell anyone and you had to sell one - don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t sell any if I was <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> - but if one was to go and you offered <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> for someone like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, I maybe would take that swap</p>

  <p><b>[Former Reds star Don Hutchison says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would wrap the title up right there if a big-money deal was done to bring in <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> alongside Virgil van Dijk]</b> I think if <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> comes through the door at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and he plays alongside <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, I think you wrap the title up right there. I don’t think there’s anyone better, there won’t be another partnership like it. The best defenders out there in Europe apart from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the moment is <a href="milan-skriniar.html">Milan Skriniar</a> at Inter <b>[Milan]</b>, my gut feeling is he’s going to join Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and alongside him is <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a>. I think at 28 he’s a great age, he’s got good pace, he’s strong, he’s a leader. I think he walks straight into <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s line up and he makes them harder to beat, he makes them a physical presence. You wouldn’t want to play against Van Dijk or <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> - how on earth as a striker do you even think about getting any joy out of those two? I think if you’re going to win titles and you want to try and adapt, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to be harder to beat. You have to go into Europe and you have to have people like <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> who can lead you in Europe. You can try and go that way when games are tight if you want a clean sheet, <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> and Van Dijk, <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson and Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b> would be nigh-on impossible to break down, Alisson behind them. And it would just put fear, I would imagine, into every manager and every player that lines up against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> trying to come up with a game plan of how you’re actually going to score goals, what is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s weakness going to be? And with <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> and Van Dijk and Alisson as that sort of triangle, that three, they would take some beating.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Reds star Don Hutchison says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> a great fit for Ozil-esque Havertz]</b> I think he’s far too good for Leverkusen. I think he goes to the very biggest clubs in Europe and I think he walks into most sides. He’s certainly got to fight for his place but the talent’s there at 20 years of age. The one player I would liken him to is a taller, faster version of <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>. I think he plays off the left-hand side, through the middle, he’s predominantly left-footed, he’s very silky, easy on the eye. So again, yes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be a great fit, but even <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> rate him that highly they are willing to trade three players for him</p>
