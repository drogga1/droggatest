<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> coach Alexander Zorniger has sung the praises of Lukas Klostermann]</b> His development is very, very extraordinary. Thanks to his speed, he could even stop <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>. We got Lukas from VfL Bochum in 2014. At that time, Peter Neururer was a coach. Peter is known for being straight with his opinions - he doesn’t shy away. Peter said: ‘Lukas is on the best path to becoming a national team player’. Lukas’ speed was - and is - a weapon. He has a great family and stays very grounded. At the same time, he also had significant issues with his technical ability, which is why I thought: ‘It’s still a very long way to the national team’. But Peter showed great foresight with Lukas.<br /><br />He is very, very rarely evaluated extremely positively after a game, but he always achieves at least 85 per cent of his maximum performance. Highly gifted attackers in particular can sometimes drop off in terms of performance. That’s why you need consistent performers like Lukas, Willi Orban or <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a> in your team</p>
