  <p><b>[David Beckham’s Inter Miami has made the first signings in club history, acquiring teenagers Matias Pellegrini and Julian Carranza]</b> It’s important for us that we found young, exciting attacking players that are on the upside of their career and have the potential to be really good players in this league. We will continue to build and add quality players that are the right fit for our club. We started with youth, but we know it’s also important to have veteran players who come from both overseas and within the league to balance out the roster over time<br /><br /><b>[Both players have represented Argentina at the youth international levels]</b> Both Julian and Matias showed us they really wanted to take the next step of their careers with Inter Miami CF. We liked that Pellegrini can play inside and out wide, has very good aerobic capacity and can cover a lot of ground, while Julian is a very grounded player with an impressive work rate. He’s the player that strives to score goals and is very good in the box.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami have named Diego Alonso as the first coach in the club’s history]</b> In Diego we found a manager that fits our culture and has a strong desire to build a winning club for our fans. He brings a lot of experience and championship-winning mentality as we begin our drive to be among the best clubs in the Americas. We have big aspirations for our club and believe Diego has the right drive, passion and leadership to accomplish our goals</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham’s Inter Miami misses out on megastar managers, but lands on ‘right man’ <a href="diego-alonso.html">Diego Alonso</a> as first head coach]</b> Every time there’s an expansion club, there’s a buzz; but the fact that this is Miami and <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> certainly ramped it up a little bit. The most important thing for us is to stay with our plan. We can’t get caught up in the outside noise because here, there are a lot of people who understand the game, and with that everyone has an opinion, which is good. But you can’t get sidetracked when the noise or criticisms come about the timing or what you’re trying to do<br /><br />I’ve been very clear from the beginning that the coach wasn’t going to build this team. We the club would build this team. We found the right man to lead the group of players we’re assembling<br /><br />He’s competed against <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams in the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League, and I paid close attention when his team was beating Atlanta United. All the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams aspire to win that, and we just signed a guy who has won it twice with two different clubs<br /><br />It’s an ambitious and winning project. That’s what I’m all about. I’m very excited. I know this league very well. I know the challenge</p>

  <p><b>[When quizzed on the <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> speculation]</b> We’re linked with a lot of players so we’ll just try to get guys signed and then we’ll talk about it. With Designated Players, it’s always a little bit harder. I think we’re close on one, so we’re in the process of trying to get that sorted out. We’ll try to get the roster complete as soon as possible but we won’t wait until the summer, I don’t think, to finish the DPs<br /><br /><b>[He added on efforts to get proven performers on board]</b> We have significant international players still to sign. We have an international winger that we’ve got agreed, we’re doing personal terms with. We have a DP striker that we’ve agreed <b>[a fee]</b> with the club, trying to see if we can get personal terms done. We have midfielders we’re trying to secure and one or two centre-backs. I don’t feel pressure to sign a big name. I feel pressure to win. I know there’s pressure from the outside, but I don’t feel any pressure to build a team. I feel pressure to build a successful team, I think there’s a lot of different ways to do that. I think if I built Atlanta United down here, everybody would be happy</p>

  <p><b>[For the first time, the club’s players gathered under manager <a href="diego-alonso.html">Diego Alonso</a> and, for the first time, Inter Miami began to resemble a team rather than a concept]</b> It’s real. Every day we do something, every milestone we hit, it becomes more real. We have players, a new coach, we’ve got grass, preseason for six weeks before we kick-off. It’s very real<br /><br /><b>[It takes time to adjust to a league as unique MLS]</b> I don’t think it makes sense to leave a Designated spot for summer. They’d play a full season until May, then tournaments like the Euros and Copa again, now you’re looking at getting them for 10 games; and I don’t think that’s what’s best for the club. We still have some more players to sign, so hopefully that will happen this week, next week, we’re not ready yet. Preseason is six weeks. We’ve got a lot of guys in, so they’ll get integrated now. We’ll integrate the others as they come. It’s a long season, I’ve learned this from doing it a couple of times. We need to be patient and not do anything rash<br /><br /><b>[Miami have not yet brought in the megastar that many have expected]</b> For me it’s more important that we put a team on the field that’s going to win. That might be a big name. Or, it might be a young player like Miguel Almiron that’s going to come in here under the radar and all of a sudden when he gets in the league, people say, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize he was that good’. (We need) a couple of defenders, midfielders, and two attacking players. We’re six away <b>[…]</b> I feel very happy with the players we have here. Could we start this way? Yeah … But we’re going to add some more special players and I think that will push us over the top</p>

  <p><b>[After bringing in one star in <a href="rodolfo-pizarro.html">Rodolfo Pizarro</a>, Inter Miami turn focus towards third and final DP signing]</b> With the city of Miami, with the ownership group we have, the ambition, a lot of players want to come here…we’re going through the process of finding out what’s legitimate, what’s not really achievable, because there are some prices that are just not achievable for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams now. The ownership group could do it if they wanted to, but I don’t think it’s responsible for us to open up a blank checkbook and write checks just because an experienced player wants it. I can go get a player that has a resale value that can help us win championships. I think that’s more responsible. If it is a veteran player that can help us win and the price is within reason, then that’s ok. We’ll explore that<br /><br /><b>[Diego Alonso is a two-time Concacaf Champions League winner with his second triumph coming with Pizarro as a key figure at Monterrey]</b> He’s a key part for <b>[national team coach]</b> <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> with Mexico. I spoke with him about him a lot. Diego obviously knows him really, really well. We think his flexibility to play any of the four spots up front, his work rate, his experience, his age. The fact that he’s won championships in a very, very difficult league in Mexico and he’s played against top European teams in the World Club Championships. It’s just something that really made sense for us to win now<br /><br />Diego was really, really happy, had a big smile on his face. Our players were really excited about it, waiting, watching in the media. They were kind of wondering when he was going to show up. It was really important for them, too, because they know what kind of player he is<br /><br />I think Pizarro is a star. Maybe not a global star, but in this region, he’s 25 years old, played for the Mexican national team. He’s won, and I would consider Pizarro a star. I understand we’re linked to a lot of players. But my stance has always been I’ll do what I think is right for the team to win. I’m not going to go sign a veteran player just to fill out a quota that he’s a global superstar. If that’s a player that can help us win and we can do it. If not, then it doesn’t make sense. We’re coming to win</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami address <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> links]</b> I’ve been very upfront and honest that I still have an intention and I hoped to sign two more significant players before the pandemic - one being a <b>[Designated Player]</b> and one being a max TAM guy. We get linked with a lot of players. A lot of players want to come here, which is great. But I think it’s more than just getting big-name players. They have to have to want to come here for the right reason. When I’m with a club, I don’t think about one year but three or four years. When I’m with a club, I don’t want to hamstring the club with a world-class player now and we may not appreciate his contract in three or four years<br /><br />I like the model of what we did in Atlanta United. It doesn’t say I wouldn’t go get a senior Designated Player that’s a global star, but the economics need to make sense, their motivations have to be right, they have to come here and be a leader. Players want that intermediate step to come here, adapt outside of Argentina or other places in South American - but mainly Argentina. And then have the opportunity to jump to Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami’s McDonough responds to <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> reports]</b> <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a>’s a top player. He’s a very well established player. But we get linked with so many players and it hasn’t stopped through this situation. So, as opportunities and as players get presented to us, we just continue to address them. Some of them are just straight rumors. Some of them are interest but they may not line up with our goals or our financial valuation. There’re so many rumors, and I have to address rumors all the time and it’s great that a lot of people are linked with Miami but we’re just looking for the right couple of pieces here to finish it off<br /><br /><a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is someone we’ve been linked with, of course. He’s an exceptional player. I can’t always comment on every rumor, whether the rumors are true or not true. I just can’t talk because I’ll always be answering rumors. He’s an exceptional player, and a lot of players that we are linked to are exceptional players. We have got roster spots open, so anything that’s good for the club, and if we think they’re good for us and they align with our goals and our vision and motivations are aligned, then we’ll have a conversation with those people.<br /><br /><b>[Almendra, a member of Argentina’s U-20 side, had previously been linked to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and Roma]</b> We had conversations with Boca. We were trying to get things done, and it’s just kind of been on pause. We’re trying to wait and see what happens when we come out of this, and what shape everybody’s in and what the appetite is for us to do it, and the availability of other players in the market</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami’s Paul McDonough on adjusting to coronavirus-impacted transfer market]</b> It’s going to be very interesting, the economic impact on the transfer markets. All clubs have suffered significant losses. In certain parts of the world, losses are more significant. I think there will be a transfer market, but I think the transfer valuations on players will probably change going forward<br /><br />We’ve always said we wanted to try and sign two more players this year. We’re constantly looking at players and trying to gauge the market and see what becomes available. There are certainly more players available now that weren’t available prior to the leagues shutting down. A lot of those availabilities are due to financial stress that the clubs are under<br /><br />This is this has really changed everything. What happens to the windows? Can you appeal to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and try to get an extension on your windows or change them? What are the roster rules with substitutions? So we’re evaluating everything as we go, we’re looking. We know that it’s still, whether we had players this summer or even for next January, we’re constantly evaluating and looking at players and trying to see how we can strengthen the team</p>
