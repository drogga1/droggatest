  <p><b>[Tite extends Brazil contract to 2022 World Cup]</b> Tite and Edu Gaspar have shown their alignment to the values we hold dear at the CBF, such as talent, competence and dedication. The CBF is investing in a long-term project as it guarantees the coaching team six years and a half at the head of the national team. We believe that careful planning and intelligent execution will lead Brazilian football to the results we expect.</p>
