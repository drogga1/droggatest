But it was a great pass from Modric. It was really important to keep playing for a point. We worked hard to get the result. It was a very competitive game - both teams wanted possession in the first half and we maybe had more chances <b>[before half-time]</b>.<br /><br />We weren’t as efficient as we could have been, but a point is better than nothing and allows us to keep the advantage in the league. It was an intense game that we played to our limit and it is a reward for the good work we’ve been doing since the start of the season. There’s a long way to go, but it’s better to rely on yourself rather than others.</p>

I’m sure everyone does the right thing, although some prefer to do things a different way. There are lies sometimes published to unsettle the team but I don’t think it will have an effect on us<br /><br /><b>[Ramos dismissed suggestions that winning a treble of LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League is now more likely]</b> I said straight after the game that we gained a very important point. It was a tough ground to go to and against a big rival … because we equalised right at the last minute it feels more valuable <b>[but]</b> the title race is still wide open. Real Madrid go for everything right from the start of the season. They always fight for the three competitions. So after Nou Camp, after the draw there, people now talk about the treble. <b>[But]</b> from the first day, the first moment, from pre-season this is our mentality. Madridistas expect to fight for all competitions. So in that respect the result is irrelevant</p>

We are all equals and the key is in our competitiveness. That was shown today with players who are not always in the first team and they are hungry, they press and they run. I will not reveal what was said, but it does annoy us. <b>[Luka]</b> Modric usually talks and the other he didn’t, and right away it is said he gave Isco and <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata an earful.

What he says won’t change any of Real Madrid. It won’t take years away from us, it won’t take titles away from us. It doesn’t matter. This is part of Pique’s persona. We are not going to change him at 30. We have to enjoy him as a footballer because he is one hell of a player. We have to tell him to wear white more often, it fits him very well.<br /><br />My goal from the 11th title was offside? If we start talking about everything… what about Iniesta <b>[who scored a controversial winner against Chelsea in the 2009 Champions League semi-final]</b>… they are not the ones to talk, they are not. And not this year. I don’t think Real Madrid will get upset about Piqué’s statements. It would be a bother if it’s Iniesta, who never speaks. But it’s Piqué…it’s one more</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Ramos says Gerard Pique undermines his own comments when he criticises Real Madrid]</b> I’m a very temperamental person but when you are wearing the captain’s armband for Real Madrid or the national team, it’s best to express yourself in a different way. You have to maintain a sense of unity - a good atmosphere where everyone feels happy is one of the keys to success, and that’s something you shouldn’t lose. I think Pique, apart from the odd personal remark, has never had a bad opinion about any of my team mates at Real Madrid but obviously when he attacks Real Madrid, our club and our institution it kind of tarnishes all of the rest of what he says.<br /><br />These are things that can be avoided and he shouldn’t really be saying but I think that Gerry, when everything is calm, he needs to have that extra little dig, just to stir things up! For me, as a captain, I have to maintain equilibrium and a good atmosphere within our national team because if I don’t, maybe we won’t end up qualifying for Russia and we’ll end up staying at home.</p>

Julen Lopetegui helped us qualify. He played a major part for us. But the sooner we focus on the World Cup, the better for all of us. There are few people more qualified than Fernando to cover after Lopetegui’s departure. We’ve all admired him as a player for a long time. So he’s the perfect candidate to cover this post.<br /><br />Well, these are situations that you’re slightly more informed about what’s going on, as a captain. We can all have our own personal interprations but the people who make decisions like this are others. The sooner we put this in the past the better. We shouldn’t focus on this too much. We have to play against the reigning European champions tomorrow and the sooner we focus on this the better. We have to forget about all of this. I think that the more experience one gets, the more mature you get and the more comfortable you feel in difficult situations. I face this World Cup with dreams in my eyes. I’m very ambitious. It’s my first World Cup as captain. Football teaches us in difficult situations so I can learn a lot from this. We also understand that Julen will be a part of what happens in this World Cup, regardless of what’s happened. We just want to focus on football. But we still have the same ambitions that we had two days ago. Obviously, no individual comes before the team in football<br /><br />I sleep well at night. I have a clear conscience. Some people like to use certain arguments to make themselves more popular but I rest easy. If anyone has any doubts, they can just check my CV.

Did you argue with the president in the dressing room? Dressing room issues are discussed and resolved in the dressing room. There’s no problem whatsoever and everybody has the same interest: @realmadrid. Did you address your team-mates and criticise them? We always talk and motivate each other in the dressing room and always in a constructive wa.<br /><br />Did you have a confrontation with Marcelo? We have exchanges in every training session. It’s part of working with pressure. But it’s just an anecdote like so many others that happen from day to day. @MarceloM12 is like a brother to me.<br /><br />Why did you travel to Valladolid? Because I wanted to be close and support my team-mates. What’s happening with the coach? It’s a decision that’s not ours to make and in which we never interfere.

There has been too much speculation about my future and I wanted to reiterate my commitment to the club.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his bond with club president <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a>]</b> My relationship with the president is similar to that of a father and son<br /><br /><b>[The announcement comes amid talk of a lucrative summer move to China]</b> There is an offer from China and If I didn’t feel wanted (at Real Madrid) then it’s an alternative. But at present my deal is with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and my plan is to see out my contract. The <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> game created a great deal of tension that’s true and it was a time for us to reset things. It’s important that I feel wanted here at the club - by the fans, team-mates and, of course, the president<br /><br /><b>[After underlining his commitment to Real, Ramos said he wanted to speak publicly]</b> So we can all enjoy the summer and ensure that my name is not in the headlines. I get annoyed to see stories circulating that are not true and that was the motivation for calling the press conference. It’s wrong that people feel when these situations arise with me and the club that it’s to do with money<br /><br /><b>[Perez said the Spanish international would not be leaving the Bernabeu on a free transfer in the wake of a prospective a move to the Chinese Super League]</b> I held a private meeting with the president, where I informed him of the offer from China. This was a private conversation that has been leaked, and the result is the specualtion we’ve seen over the past few days. Once again, this was my motivation in holding this press conference<br /><br /><b>[The defender conceded he might be subject of boos by the Madrid faithful]</b> The fans whistle as they want a reaction from the players. I’ve had it . Even <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was whistled. Sometimes things don’t work out as we hope in the game of football<br /><br />My intention is to construct a new <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with the president and start to look to the future. I still have the physical strength to play for the club. How long will this last? I don’t know … two, four, six years. When the time comes to move on I’ll do so but in a place where I never have to face Real Madrid<br /><br />I’m not sure if I’d consider China as a future destination. I’ve always felt a warm welcome there, but I really don’t know if two or four years from now I’ll go to China, the United States or if I’ll stay as a coach</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Ramos says Beating <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> brings ‘great joy’]</b> It’s not just any other game. Despite there just being three points at stake, as there is in every game, El Clasico is a game unlike any other. Beating <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would bring us great joy. What’s more, it usually has a really positive impact on the group in terms of morale. teams know that and it’s something that we have to deal with as best we can to turn it into an incentive that drives you on to victory<br /><br />Right from the start of the week, the whole experience is different. It brings a lot of media attention, but that’s also what makes this game so great, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, the players… The feeling you get is one that comes from inside, it’s really hard to explain<br /><br />It’ll be very evenly contested, on account of the stage of the season we’re at and because there’s hardly any difference in terms of the points we have. It could be pivotal or not, depending on the result, but I think that there’s still a really long way to go in the <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> season. There’s a lot of points to play for and anything can happen<br /><br />It’ll be really important for us to win at home, in front of our fans, which is also an added motivation for us and will give us greater satisfaction if we win. We’re stronger with them behind us and that has to show. Let’s hope that we can make a statement and win at home. It’s true that <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is very competitive, but we’re going to be fighting for the title. We’re really excited by the prospect of winning it, and we’re therefore focused on performing to our best. <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> gets more difficult by the year and it’s ever more evenly matched. Today you can’t go out saying that you’re going to win at every ground, because that’s not true. Any of the teams can cause you problems.

It’ll give us even great satisfaction if we win the title<br /><br /><b>[<a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has transformed Madrid back into trophy contenders]</b> He’s an excellent coach, not only on account of his record and all of the trophies we’ve won under him. He spent many years here as a player and has a really good command of life in the dressing room. Not everyone is able to manage a dressing room, or at least not in such a natural way as he does. Regardless of whether they get more or less game time, he’s got all of the players motivated and that’s one of his big strengths. He knows exactly what he can get out of each of us and I see him as being the perfect coach for a team like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.

Not just because of the statistics and all the trophies we’ve won with him, but also because he was here for many years as a player. He works the dressing room very well. He’s privileged in that sense; he lived it as a player, and now he manages it as a coach. Not everyone can do it<br /><br />As the years go on, you become more experienced, but you also think about things like El Clasico more than you used to. As far as I’m concerned, I’m just as excited about these games as I was years ago. I don’t play as if it were my last Clasico, I play as if it were my first, with the same ambition and desire to win. As we all know, it’s not a normal game. Even though it’s three points just like every other game, beating <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is huge and a really big emotional boost for us. It’s the same for them<br /><br />Our objective is to win, keep winning and not get tired of winning. That’s the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> philosophy.

In football anything can happen, but we have to fight until the end, keep up the final push and keep working as people expect us to.

  <p><b>[Sergio Ramos reveals secrets to his success at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> The secret is hard work. It’s dedication and not losing focus or ambition. That’s fundamental. It’s tough, but if you can reset yourself every season to keep fighting, win trophies and to keep up that attitude of wanting to win new titles, that’s really important. Looking after myself and keeping in the best shape possible is always at the forefront of my mind. You learn new things every year so there’s always room to improve. That’s what you have to focus on, to keep improving to make the most of the situation you’re in<br /><br />For me, representing and captaining this club is a privilege. It makes me very, very proud.

I think he’s one of the greatest players in history and I have huge respect for him. I hope Sunday isn’t his day, that would mean we’ve done our job, and if on top of that we can get a good result even better. I wish him all the best as a fellow professional but only as long as it doesn’t affect us negatively! It’s hard, but he has my maximum respect, I think he’s one of the best<br /><br /><b>[When asked how his side can cause the Catalans problems]</b> We’ve played them many times, so we know how to trouble them. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are a team who keep possession a lot. They’re most uncomfortable when you try to take it from them. Everyone knows that, not just <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Putting pressure on them high up is risky but it causes them problems. Before it didn’t happen so much, maybe because teams gave them too much respect and they would play the ball out from the back really well. But I think that’s the key: pressure high up the pitch and try to steal the ball from them, that’s when they’re most uncomfortable. There’s always the risk that up top they’ve got very dangerous players who can be decisive in El Clasico. Hopefully it doesn’t come to that, that we maintain our concentration from the first minute until the last and that things turn out as we want them to<br /><br />It will be very tight. The points difference between both sides is minimal and the result could be decisive this season. But there’s still a long way to go, there are still a lot of points up for grabs and anything can happen. But a win would be huge for us, playing at home in front of our fans. That gives us extra motivation and satisfaction; together with them we’re stronger. Our rivals have to feel that, and so do we when we’re out there on the pitch.
