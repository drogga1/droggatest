They act in a different way, for instance with the ‘Neymar case’. I believe we still do not know what happened. There are many serious issues and someone is going to pay dearly for them</p>

Harvard’s a pretty big deal in America, right? Well, playing with that team in that tournament was like going to the Ivy League of football. It was a first-class, front-row education on how to not just play football, but how to be a footballer. How to be a World Cup champion. I didn’t play a minute in that tournament, but I watched and absorbed everything that I could. I took notes, collected all this information, knowing that someday I was going to be back.

That was a generation in which being the best was much more difficult.<br /><br />I do not know what went behind his transfer, maybe there was a problem with the presidency of Barcelona, like what happened with me. Neymar’s departure from Barcelona has many parallels with what happened in 1997. I went to Inter when the Italian league was much stronger than the French league today</p>

Inter need to keep their best players to make a team for the Champions League. Reaching the Champions League means a lot, but it’s not everything. Reaching the fourth place has never been and will never be the main goal for Inter. Winning the Scudetto is not easy, but they must be at least in the race to win it next year</p>

But, from what I see, he’s not on the market<br /><br />I have even been criticised, most unfairly. We cannot do anything about it. I see him as a very intelligent kid, an extraordinary talent, and wanting to have continuity again.

But, in any case, I think it’s good that it’s investigated because we should all want for there to be no corruption. Look, I’m from Brazil and over there we’ve got a tremendous amount of corruption.

  <p><b>[Brazil legend Ronaldo has revealed that he never wanted to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> back in 1997]</b> I’d signed a contract renewal at the end of the season and I went away with the Brazil national team. Five days later, they called me to tell me that I couldn’t continue with the renewal. It was never in my hands. I wanted to stay. If the club didn’t value me as I thought they should, then the decision wasn’t in my hands. I would have liked to have stayed, but it wasn’t up to me.<br /><br /><b>[Ronaldo said of his time with Real]</b> I played alongside <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> for Brazil, and he would tell me about all that Madrid represented, and what he experienced there.

It’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. There is great expectation and great pressure. There are also, of course, the best players in the world. I was delighted to find out that it was such a huge club, and that I could help the club to be even greater.<br /><br />There was a lot of expectation about that group of ‘Galacticos’. In the end we provided a lot of showmanship, were a winning generation, and changed the way of doing business in football. Since then, every club has generated more money and sold their players better. That was the big change in a new era of football. However, I can’t tell you which version of me was the best. I enjoyed all of them, of course. I love playing football and I love football. I think that’s more a question for the fans. I tried to be the best I could be throughout my entire career</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo pens emotional letter to fans amid coronavirus pandemic]</b> For weeks I have been thinking about how to contact you in these delicate moments of confinement and bad news. Finally, I have decided to send you this letter, and I hope you can feel the affection and consideration with which I have written it. From my house to yours. From my family to your family. We are separated by physical distance, but I am convinced that we have never been so close. Empathy is what unites us now. The collective spirit, responsibility, humanity. We are inside our houses for ourselves, for those we love, for all whom we do not even know and for those who can no longer be with us. We help each other by enhancing this solidarity in multiple ways. I am writing to thank you for being there, even more now, transforming your house into a home. For turning every moment into something memorable for your family. For patience, caution and your optimism, despite all the difficulties, challenges and losses that we are facing in these difficult times. Soccer has taught me many things. The biggest was how to overcome things. When I suffered my first and most serious knee injury, there were people who said that I would never play again, and that I could never even walk again. I felt like my own life was being taken from me. It was in those moments that my limits were tested, and I fought to change those opinions and show everyone that I could do what I wanted most. They were three very hard years of rehabilitation, motivated by the desire to feel all that I could only feel on the field, with the ball at my feet. In the end, the moment came, perhaps the most iconic of my entire career: in 2002, in Japan, playing a World Cup final with Brazil. Scoring two goals against Germany. For my country, the title of five-time champion; for me, the consecration of my return. I am sure that you too, when you look back, you will remember how many times you got up, of all your battles, and how many times you managed to overcome, throughout your life, to make the impossible possible and get to where you are being who you are. If this letter reaches you today, it is because, among the choices of my life, one has been the Pucela (Valladolid). I have also chosen. I have also been passionate. Like you, I look forward to the return to our home. I close my eyes and think about that Zorrilla full of fans. It is the passion that moves me. Off the field, I am still motivated to overcome every challenge. And personally, that I have come after you to this family, I thank you for being with me. Stay strong. We are together and we will come out stronger from all this</p>
