  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> 2-0 <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> We were well in the game. We started brightly but once we conceded we wobbled. At 1-0 there was always a chance we could get into the game but the second goal was of huge quality and ended it. We are developing all the time as a side. We still have some way to go but if we make the same improvement again we will be a good side. We took the game to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the first half but unfortunately the quality of their players told in the end</p>

We work in the same way with all the players, to try to improve them individually. Always the responsibility is with the player how much they will improve, because it is their responsibility to take everything on board. That’s what Josh has done. I’ve been very, very impressed.</p>

It’s been clear to us as a club for some time that Ryan was not going to sign a new contract with us. The first thing to say on this is no-one could have predicted what would have happened with the virus, the season shutting down and then being extended. Ryan’s then found himself in a very difficult position because of that. He has now played his last game for the football club. He won’t be involved with us for the last nine games. I only want players who are fully focused on the relegation battle that we have ahead and I’m looking forward to doing that with my squad. These are the most important games this football club has had in recent times and we need everybody in the same position mentally, fight tooth and nail for the football club. Ryan, due to his contract situation, can’t commit to that. Two games for us wasn’t going to make the difference. We need a nine-game commitment and he can’t give that at this moment in time. We go ahead with the current squad and probably the strongest squad I’ve had to pick from this season.

You don’t want to lose any player through suspension - especially not for two games at this stage of the season - so that’s definitely something for us to look back on with Callum.

I think definitely the goalscoring issue has been an issue for us throughout the season and I think the biggest concern is it has been very unlike us. Where historically we have always scored goals - and historically we have probably always conceded them - the fact the goals column has been tough to impact has definitely contributed to a dip in confidence levels. I look back before lockdown and there’s some really tough defeats there when we had played well, and then since lockdown the two games have been tight but we haven’t done enough to impact their goalkeeper.

  <p><b>[Eddie Howe on Solanke]</b> He deserves great credit. I’ve always believed that Dom’s an outstanding player, he’s got a lot of expectation on his shoulders and rightly so because he’s an outstanding player, technically very good, he’s very intelligent and I do think there are a lot of goals in him. I think he’s proved that today because it was two really good finishes, both totally different, but he’s a player we totally believe in</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> kept their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> survival hopes alive after coming from behind to beat Champions League-chasing <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> 4-1 at the Vitality Stadium]</b> It was a difficult game for us, I have to credit <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> with how they played in the first half. We were in a really difficult situation at half-time, they’d played well, and we hadn’t. We obviously needed to change things at half-time and just had a mentality that we went for the game and gave everything in that second half to try and get a result. Thankfully, we were able to swing the game around<br /><br />We’re in there <b>[with a chance of surviving]</b>. It’s still going to be difficult but we’re in there fighting and we’ll continue to do that right until the end. I’ve always believed the players are good enough to get the results we need, probably for the first time tonight in a long time, we’ve had a bit of luck to go with a lot of work that went into the match. Hopefully that can give us the lift we need for the remaining three games</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> are fresh from a victory themselves]</b> Winning is everything. It breeds so many good positive outcomes, it’s what we absolutely needed. We go into the <b>[final]</b> three games with a very positive mindset. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is a very different game to any other you face in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They’ve got some unique qualities, an outstanding manager, brilliant players. It’s a huge task at hand but I believe it’s possible. If we can put it all together, we’re more than capable of getting a result<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> are set to be without <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> - and the defender could miss the rest of the season]</b> It’s a minor groin injury for Nathan. It’s not too serious. I don’t know whether we’ll see Nathan again this season. It’s not a definite no, but it’s not a definite yes.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> provided a masterclass as he heads towards his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> swansong in <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s 2-1 win over <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>, which edged the plucky Cherries closer to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> relegation]</b> Their clinical finishing was the different between the teams. We had some great opening ourselves, we weren’t quite as ruthless as they were, we’ll kick ourselves when we look back at some of the chances. Today we looked a real threat in front of goal, I thought we had a lot of quality in our performance, we played at the right times, mixed it up quite well, were strong, and so I’m absolutely devastated to come away with nothing after giving so much to the game</p>

  <p><b>[Eddie Howe says <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> can only focus on themselves in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> survival fight]</b> I don’t know whether I will watch the game or not <b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> vs <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>]</b> but we can only focus on ourselves and trying to get maximum points from our next two games. That takes importance over any other result or games that are going on and I would encourage the players not to watch it either. They just need to concentrate on themselves and getting in the best physical and mental condition possible to play our game. For various reasons we are where we are and I’ve got no idea what it will take to stay up - all we can do is try and hope it is good enough.<br /><br />We were heartened by the performance and I anticipate the players will be in a very good place. There were so many good things to take from it and if we can repeat that high performance level and the number of chances created against a very good opponent then that will serve us well. The players are in a very good place and confidence levels have definitely shifted upwards as we have gone through the restart. You’re definitely seeing a better performance from the team, especially in the last three games</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Mepham: <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> defender out for six weeks after knee surgery]</b> He had the injection, the injection didn’t help the problem, so he’s gone under the knife. We anticipate he will be out for around six weeks. We don’t think it’s too serious - hopefully that’s the problem fixed.<br /><br />It is very difficult for him because before he picked up the (first) injury against Luton in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup he was in a really good run of form. He was growing in confidence every week and showing everybody how good he could be. Then he had that operation which was quite serious. This one I don’t think is as bad but it’s a blow to him. But he’s a really positive lad. He’s got a very bright future ahead of him, a long career, so it’s important we try to get this one right for him.</p>
