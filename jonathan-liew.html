<h4 id="2014-03-09-publish-arsenal-manager-arsène-wenger-calls-on-mesut-özil-to-concentrate-on-scoring-as-german-whirs-back-into-life">2014 03 09 Publish: <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a> calls on <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Özil</a> to concentrate on scoring as German whirs back into life</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager wants more goals from <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Özil</a> as £42-million signing scores for the first time in 17 matches during 4-1 FA Cup win over Everton<br /><br />Relax, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans: it was nothing. Like a lavishly expensive new cordless blender that whirred like a dream for the first few months before developing a series of mildly alarming technical glitches, the supporters whose season tickets paid for the services of <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Özil</a> would have privately wondered whether they had bought a dud: £42 million attacking midfielders tend not to come with an extended service warranty<br /><br />After a messy Christmas gave way to a scrappy New Year, perhaps these are early signs that the playmaker is rediscovering his lust for the fight<br /><br />One of the theories about <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a>’s curious period of hibernation was that his body was unused to the unusual rigours of an English festive programme. The winter break is a long-standing element in the German domestic calendar, and well established, if shorter, in Spain, where he moved to play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in 2010<br /><br />With hindsight, perhaps that was a red herring. One of the more heart-stirring moments of the first half on Saturday was the breakdown of an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> breakaway led by Kevin Mirallas. Mirallas is no slouch, and yet for 60 yards he was matched stride for stride by Özil: one attacking, one defending, both sprinting like cheetahs. The No 11s on their backs might as well have been speed stripes. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a> won the duel, got the tackle in. Nobody who saw those few seconds could question his fettle<br /><br />Now, as <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> explained, the strain had been mental, not physical … In this direction, however, lie further questions. Fairly or unfairly, the tag that still attaches itself to <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a> is that too often, he does not influence the biggest games against the best opposition.<br /><br />As absurd as this may seem for a man who has scored the winning goal in a German Cup final, made the match-winning assist in El Clásico and scored in a Euro 2012 semi-final, the second leg against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> on Tuesday offers a chance to set the record straight<br /><br />Perhaps the comparison with his former team-mate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is unfair, as too was the assertion of his former Germany under-21 coach Horst Hrubesch in 2009 that ‘Our <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is Özil’. But the suspicion remains that had <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> missed a crucial penalty in the opening stages of a Champions League game, he would simply have gone and won three more. If <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are going to bang their fist on Europe’s top table, they need <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a> to improve into that sort of player. And <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> believed there was scope for him to do so<br /><br />History may well blame media schizophrenia for <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a>’s tribulations this season: build ‘em up to knock ‘em down to build ‘em up again. But it was not the media booing <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Özil</a> as he played for Germany in Stuttgart in midweek, but his home fans</p>
