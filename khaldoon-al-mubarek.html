I’ve read a lot about the speculation on this. It’s ridiculous. Sergio Aguero is one of the best players in the world and we are a team that aspires to win every competition we compete in. Having Sergio Aguero in the squad is an absolute must, it has never been in doubt.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak says Sheikh Mansour has given Pep Guardiola’s transfer plans the green light as the club close in on several priority targets]</b> If you look at our last two or three windows, the number of players we have done and that continuous change we have made in the squad has worked well for us. I think this year we will see more of that. There are particular positions that are clear. You can see the players that are exiting right now, and that will give a clear indication of the positions that are a high priority for us to fill. Full-back is clear both on the right and the left are areas that require investment from our side.<br /><br />Pep relies heavily on that position. The way he plays, and you’ve seen glimpses of that this year, he has a big affinity to that full-back position on the right and the left, and he has a big requirement in terms of the type of players that fit the role he wants for that position. So that’s an area that clearly requires some work and we know exactly what Pep wants. More importantly Pep knows what he wants and who he wants. I hope we are successful in bringing in the players he needs.<br /><br /><b>[On Ederson]</b> You should expect us to bring in a goalkeeper. That’s another area that requires some work. Pep knows exactly what he needs. We’ve done a lot of work on this area and our target has been set. Hopefully you’ll be hearing soon what we’re going to be doing in that area<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez and Juventus’ Leonardo Bonucci are also key targets]</b> It’s a process that’s continuous, it’s part of our day-to-day operation. Scouting is every day, all season long. The manager is thinking about the squad every day, not just at the end of the season or the beginning, throughout the season. Txiki, Brian Marwood, everyone in our football operation thinks about this every day. That thinking evolves throughout the year to get to a final point where decisions are made.<br /><br />That thinking evolves throughout the year and we get to a final point at the end of the season where decisions are made, directions are decided and that is a decision that involves scouting from the beginning, the definition that the manager decides in terms of the positions that need to be filled, the players that are leaving and the players that he wants coming in.<br /><br />With the support of Txiki, Brian, our scouting network, there is a plan that comes together, a discussion that happens with Ferran Soriano and myself, an agreement and then a final a endorsement from his Highness Sheikh Mansour who gives us the green light to concede.<br /><br />So it’s a continuous process. It didn’t begin on the Monday the day after the season ended, it’s been going on from the beginning. It’s a continuous conversation, it’s a continual conversation between me and his Highness. Sheikh Mansour asks for regular updates on how our thinking is evolving. He’s also in the process, he knows where we are going, so there are no surprises. By the time we come with our final lists, he has been aware from the beginning of where we are heading, so it’s not me showing up one day, saying, ‘This is the list, these are the players we want’. Mansour from the beginning is part of the process and I keep him up-to-date on how Pep’s thinking is going and how the group is supporting him</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure has the offer to stay on at Manchester City, with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak reluctant to lose the midfielder]</b> Yaya has shown us this year again and again how he can contribute to this team. Yaya is one of the players that over the last six years has been instrumental to the success of this club. This year has been another year in which he has shown us on the pitch the type of player he is, the type of personality he is, and how he continues to be a player who can give to the is team and to our organisation. Pep, as you have seen obviously this year, has a lot of trust and confidence in him. So Yaya I hope will be with us and continue his journey with us.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak has claimed that the club must aim to win both the Premier League and the Champions League every season under his ownership]</b> There’s no doubt it’s extremely hard to do the double, because of the nature of the Premier League and the level of competition in the Champions League. This is an unbelievably challenging feat to achieve, but nevertheless you would not be in the position I am if you don’t think and believe you can do it.<br /><br />The last two champions in the Premier League have won the league without playing in Europe. So that’s shown, in my view, the advantage that that puts for the people who are not competing in Europe. But we also have to acknowledge that Leicester was an anomaly, it was for a team with the resources with Leicester City have, is unbelievable for them to win the league, it truly is a remarkable feat. In Chelsea’s case I think with the squad Chelsea has, with the manager, the organisation and the resources that Chelsea has, the anomaly was for them to finish 10th the season before, not that they won the league this year.<br /><br />Chelsea playing in the league this year without Europe no doubt provided them with an important advantage and that’s helped them win the league, but I don’t take anything away from them. Winning the league is winning the league, and they’ve done an incredible job and my hat is off to Antonio Conte and his squad and the entire management of Chelsea, they’ve done an incredible job this year and the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />But nevertheless, the point remains that going into next year, no doubt, teams that are in Europe will have a more challenging experience of winning the league than teams not in Europe but that’s no excuse because, for us, our job is to try to win both the Premier League and the Champions League and to do everything we can to do so and that will remain our objective</p>

  <p><b>[Khaldoon Al Mubarak has branded <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> chief <a href="javier-tebas.html">Javier Tebas</a> and other critics ‘jealous’, and insists his side will not be banned from the Champions League or receive a transfer ban]</b> He talks about how we distorted the market? There is a hypocrisy in this statement that is ironic. Number one, let’s look at the Spanish league, the time of breaking records on player acquisitions, I mean, who started that? Let’s go back to the world records, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. These huge jumps in these transfers, where did they happen? You know, the history, you have to look back at the history of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, a league dominated by two clubs, and Mr <a href="javier-tebas.html">Tebas</a> should look back at the history of that league and how distortion has happened throughout the ages. And then you look back at transfers. In the top 10 transfers of all time, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> has not a single player in that, not a single one. So I don’t really take it seriously and I ask our fans to always put it in context. Always look at facts. And I think people with glass homes shouldn’t be throwing rocks. I’m happy to talk to anyone as long as the conversation is about facts but once we start talking about innuendo and talking about theories I have no time for that.<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak says English clubs should start to take a stand against <a href="javier-tebas.html">Tebas</a>’s attacks]</b> We have the best league in the world, we have the most commercial league in the world, the most successful clubs in the world, economically, commercially in terms of global presence, and that’s why this attack is not just on <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, it’s against this league. And I hope people start seeing that and start… I know people don’t want to defend <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but for God’s sake start defending this league<br /><br /><b>[Yet Al Mubarak also rounded on other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs, who he suggests have leaked information to the media in a bid to put pressure on the governing bodies investigating the club]</b> With success, there is a certain level of jealousy, envy, whatever you call it, that’s part of the game. You know when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> dominated <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for many years, they know what they had to deal with for so many years, that’s part of the game. It’s not easy for our competition, we know that; and by the way, the football world is very small and word comes around very quickly so you know, when someone somewhere in a leading position in any club says something, or briefs something, guess what? We know about it.<br /><br />The reality is, we didn’t buy the most expensive player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we didn’t buy the most expensive goalkeeper, we didn’t buy the most expensive midfielder, we didn’t buy the most expensive striker, so when people throw that, you know what they throw at us, I go back: let’s look at facts, let’s talk about facts. I will not accept for this club to be used as a diversionary tactic on poor investment decisions from other clubs. People make decisions, they’ve got to live by them. We’ve managed ourselves well and we will be judged by facts and facts alone. This is a well-run club. That’s a fact; a well-managed wage to revenue ratio that compares to some of the best run clubs in his league, la liga but frankly in all of European football<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak strikes a similar tone, stressing that City will not be found guilty by any of the bodies investigating its conduct, providing decisions are based on facts]</b> Am I uncomfortable? No. I respect regulatory bodies doing their job and any regulatory process that asks questions. We have to professionally respond which is what we have done. We are dealing with each of these entities as per the process, we have clear answers. I believe, quite comfortably, if the process is going to be judged on facts then unquestionably we will prevail. If it’s not about facts and it’s about other things, then it is a different conversation. But I strongly hope that these regulatory bodies will ultimately make the decision based on facts. Now having said that, just going back on this wave that we are dealing with, I think, listen, I’ll be philosophical about this, the reality is we have dealt with this before, with Uefa, this is not the first time we have dealt with it. We are going through the appropriate steps and we’re confident in our position, very comfortable in our position. I’m not concerned about that because facts will prevail</p>

Vincent is a part of the family, will always be part of the family and this journey continues. I have a good feeling for sure that we’ll be seeing Vincent back here in some capacity at some point in the future.<br /><br /><b>[While he said the Belgian was irreplaceable, Al Mubarak believes Kompany’s decision to move on was the right one]</b> Vincent sees himself certainly in his career going into coaching and I think having that opportunity to go back to his home team, to coach Anderlecht and to play as a player-coach was a very unique opportunity for that time so I think for him the stars kind of lined up and it made sense. From a footballing sense, I think he made absolutely the right decision and I told Vincent, ‘Whatever you decide, I’m behind you 100 per cent’ and he ultimately took that decision. We’ll miss, we’ll miss him, no doubt about that, we will give him the right tribute, his testimonial will be an amazing event that I’m looking forward to and this club will respect Vincent in the way that he deserves and I’m confident that the story of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> is far from over</p>
