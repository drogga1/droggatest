  <p><b>[Manchester City have announced <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> is to be honoured with a sculpture outside the Etihad Stadium]</b> Vincent is a special figure in the history of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> Football Club. He is not only an inspirational and resolute leader on the pitch, but an impeccable and articulate ambassador off it. His contribution will be remembered for generations to come, by supporters of our club and the wider football community who rightly recognise Vincent as one of the iconic <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> figures of his generation</p>

  <p><b>[It’s not quite the homegrown conveyor belt that was expected when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> took over the club in 2016]</b> That’s one of the reasons why Pep was so highly considered. He has done that with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he has done that with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Even with the abundance of talent he had with both first teams, Pep always has a knack for talent and he loves to find young players that have incredible talent<br /><br />We would like to have the maximum amount of players in the first team coming out of our academy</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have announced a club-record £535.2 million revenue and a £10.1 million profit as part of their 2018-19 annual report]</b> This outcome represents not just a season, but a decade of hard work. The organisation is now at a level of maturity that enables us to plan on multi-year cycles both in terms of our management of squads and more widely across the business. This strategic planning has allowed us to create an environment in which continued on-pitch success is both possible and likely, and financial sustainability is a reality</p>

  <p><b>[Silver Lake becomes CFG’s second major partner]</b> Silver Lake is a global leader in technology investing, and we are delighted by both the validation that their investment in CFG represents, and the opportunities for further growth that their partnership brings. We and Silver Lake share the strong belief in the opportunities being presented by the convergence of entertainment, sports and technology and the resulting ability for CFG to generate long-term growth and new revenue streams globally.

  <p><b>[Khaldoon Al Mubarak says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> remains fully committed to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and the club intend to maintain managerial continuity]</b> Pep has been an incredible asset to this organisation. We can speak about his managerial accomplishments for hours. But I think as a person, as an individual, as a friend, he’s been a core part of what we’ve accomplished here over the last three years. He’s very committed. We’re committed to him. You’ve seen his interview a couple of days ago. We have a great relationship. We have a great environment here. The people around him, the team we have in place today, the relationships I have with them, this is really an environment that’s conducive to success for both him and everyone involved. So I’m very satisfied with his commitment and our commitment to him and I’m looking forward to the continuity of this for years to come<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak would not divulge details of a potential new deal]</b> I’m very proud of what Raheem has done over the last couple of years. His evolution as a player, but more importantly as a person I think has been exceptional. He’s become a leader both on and off the pitch. He’s become a leader in this squad at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, he’s becoming a leader at England serving his country. And I think he’s been a leader in the community. I’m so happy for him because I think he’s a wonderful young man and I think his talent, listen, there’s one thing I’m sure of - Raheem is only going to improve and only going to grow as both a player and a leader, so the future is incredibly bright for Raheem and it’s a pleasure to have him as a part of our team</p>

City Football Group is committed to the future of football in India and to the potential for Mumbai City FC within that future. We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in Mumbai City FC’s fan and local communities, and working with our co-owners to further develop the club as quickly as possible<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak made it clear that expansion in India was a priority for CFG given the established ventures in the United States and China]</b> When we look at growth, we look at three major markets - the United States, China and India. We’ve invested in New York and that’s our US presence in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, we’ve invested in China and certainly India is the next big market that we’d like to have a position in. I hope very soon we’ll be able to make our move into that market and continue our growth trajectory in the right markets globally</p>
