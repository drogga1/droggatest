  <p><b>[Khaldoon Al Mubarak has branded La Liga chief Javier Tebas and other critics ‘jealous’, and insists his side will not be banned from the Champions League or receive a transfer ban]</b> He talks about how we distorted the market? There is a hypocrisy in this statement that is ironic. Number one, let’s look at the Spanish league, the time of breaking records on player acquisitions, I mean, who started that? Let’s go back to the world records, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane. These huge jumps in these transfers, where did they happen? You know, the history, you have to look back at the history of La Liga, a league dominated by two clubs, and Mr Tebas should look back at the history of that league and how distortion has happened throughout the ages. And then you look back at transfers. In the top 10 transfers of all time, Manchester City has not a single player in that, not a single one. So I don’t really take it seriously and I ask our fans to always put it in context. Always look at facts. And I think people with glass homes shouldn’t be throwing rocks. I’m happy to talk to anyone as long as the conversation is about facts but once we start talking about innuendo and talking about theories I have no time for that.<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak says English clubs should start to take a stand against Tebas’s attacks]</b> We have the best league in the world, we have the most commercial league in the world, the most successful clubs in the world, economically, commercially in terms of global presence, and that’s why this attack is not just on Manchester City, it’s against this league. And I hope people start seeing that and start… I know people don’t want to defend Manchester City, but for God’s sake start defending this league<br /><br /><b>[Yet Al Mubarak also rounded on other Premier League clubs, who he suggests have leaked information to the media in a bid to put pressure on the governing bodies investigating the club]</b> With success, there is a certain level of jealousy, envy, whatever you call it, that’s part of the game. You know when Manchester United dominated the Premier League for many years, they know what they had to deal with for so many years, that’s part of the game. It’s not easy for our competition, we know that; and by the way, the football world is very small and word comes around very quickly so you know, when someone somewhere in a leading position in any club says something, or briefs something, guess what? We know about it.<br /><br />The reality is, we didn’t buy the most expensive player in the Premier League, we didn’t buy the most expensive goalkeeper, we didn’t buy the most expensive midfielder, we didn’t buy the most expensive striker, so when people throw that, you know what they throw at us, I go back: let’s look at facts, let’s talk about facts. I will not accept for this club to be used as a diversionary tactic on poor investment decisions from other clubs. People make decisions, they’ve got to live by them. We’ve managed ourselves well and we will be judged by facts and facts alone. This is a well-run club. That’s a fact; a well-managed wage to revenue ratio that compares to some of the best run clubs in his league, la liga but frankly in all of European football<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak strikes a similar tone, stressing that City will not be found guilty by any of the bodies investigating its conduct, providing decisions are based on facts]</b> Am I uncomfortable? No. I respect regulatory bodies doing their job and any regulatory process that asks questions. We have to professionally respond which is what we have done. We are dealing with each of these entities as per the process, we have clear answers. I believe, quite comfortably, if the process is going to be judged on facts then unquestionably we will prevail. If it’s not about facts and it’s about other things, then it is a different conversation. But I strongly hope that these regulatory bodies will ultimately make the decision based on facts. Now having said that, just going back on this wave that we are dealing with, I think, listen, I’ll be philosophical about this, the reality is we have dealt with this before, with Uefa, this is not the first time we have dealt with it. We are going through the appropriate steps and we’re confident in our position, very comfortable in our position. I’m not concerned about that because facts will prevail</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak believes Vincent Kompany will one day return to the Premier League club]</b> It’s certainly not goodbye. Vincent is a part of the family, will always be part of the family and this journey continues. I have a good feeling for sure that we’ll be seeing Vincent back here in some capacity at some point in the future.<br /><br /><b>[While he said the Belgian was irreplaceable, Al Mubarak believes Kompany’s decision to move on was the right one]</b> Vincent sees himself certainly in his career going into coaching and I think having that opportunity to go back to his home team, to coach Anderlecht and to play as a player-coach was a very unique opportunity for that time so I think for him the stars kind of lined up and it made sense. From a footballing sense, I think he made absolutely the right decision and I told Vincent, ‘Whatever you decide, I’m behind you 100 per cent’ and he ultimately took that decision. We’ll miss, we’ll miss him, no doubt about that, we will give him the right tribute, his testimonial will be an amazing event that I’m looking forward to and this club will respect Vincent in the way that he deserves and I’m confident that the story of Manchester City and Vincent Kompany is far from over</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have announced <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> is to be honoured with a sculpture outside the Etihad Stadium]</b> Vincent is a special figure in the history of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> Football Club. He is not only an inspirational and resolute leader on the pitch, but an impeccable and articulate ambassador off it. His contribution will be remembered for generations to come, by supporters of our club and the wider football community who rightly recognise Vincent as one of the iconic <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> figures of his generation</p>

  <p><b>[It’s not quite the homegrown conveyor belt that was expected when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> took over the club in 2016]</b> That’s one of the reasons why Pep was so highly considered. He has done that with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he has done that with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Even with the abundance of talent he had with both first teams, Pep always has a knack for talent and he loves to find young players that have incredible talent<br /><br />We would like to have the maximum amount of players in the first team coming out of our academy</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have announced a club-record £535.2 million revenue and a £10.1 million profit as part of their 2018-19 annual report]</b> This outcome represents not just a season, but a decade of hard work. The organisation is now at a level of maturity that enables us to plan on multi-year cycles both in terms of our management of squads and more widely across the business. This strategic planning has allowed us to create an environment in which continued on-pitch success is both possible and likely, and financial sustainability is a reality</p>

  <p><b>[Khaldoon Al Mubarak says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> remains fully committed to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and the club intend to maintain managerial continuity]</b> Pep has been an incredible asset to this organisation. We can speak about his managerial accomplishments for hours. But I think as a person, as an individual, as a friend, he’s been a core part of what we’ve accomplished here over the last three years. He’s very committed. We’re committed to him. You’ve seen his interview a couple of days ago. We have a great relationship. We have a great environment here. The people around him, the team we have in place today, the relationships I have with them, this is really an environment that’s conducive to success for both him and everyone involved. So I’m very satisfied with his commitment and our commitment to him and I’m looking forward to the continuity of this for years to come<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak would not divulge details of a potential new deal]</b> I’m very proud of what Raheem has done over the last couple of years. His evolution as a player, but more importantly as a person I think has been exceptional. He’s become a leader both on and off the pitch. He’s become a leader in this squad at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, he’s becoming a leader at England serving his country. And I think he’s been a leader in the community. I’m so happy for him because I think he’s a wonderful young man and I think his talent, listen, there’s one thing I’m sure of - Raheem is only going to improve and only going to grow as both a player and a leader, so the future is incredibly bright for Raheem and it’s a pleasure to have him as a part of our team</p>

We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in Mumbai City FC’s fan and local communities, and working with our co-owners to further develop the club as quickly as possible<br /><br /><b>[Al Mubarak made it clear that expansion in India was a priority for CFG given the established ventures in the United States and China]</b> When we look at growth, we look at three major markets - the United States, China and India. We’ve invested in New York and that’s our US presence in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, we’ve invested in China and certainly India is the next big market that we’d like to have a position in.
