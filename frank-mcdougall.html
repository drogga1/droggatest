<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> There were explosive moments with him as manager but that wasn’t a problem. Sometimes the manager upset a player because he wanted to win so badly. He had that desire and that rubbed off on us. You had to do well because if you didn’t, he would let you know. You had to do well and I think players realised that and played for him.<br /><br />Of course he lost his temper and there was a fear about the place but he also looked after his players and he earned massive respect for that. He was a genius. It was a privilege to play for him and I consider him a friend. He is the greatest manager of all time and probably always will be</p>
