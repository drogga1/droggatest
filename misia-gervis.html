<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sonny Pike was heralded as the ‘next big thing’ to emerge out of British football when his skills with the ball earned him a move to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. But his promise was never realised]</b> His story is classic, inasmuch that of course he was going to get depression. I’m not surprised in the least, because his whole identity was poured into ‘you’re a player! You’re going to be a player!’ and people were exploiting that. Then when it didn’t happen he’s going, ‘oh, well who am I then? Everyone told me I’m going to be this. I’m not this person.’<br /><br /><b>[There is something of a blame game, but Pike, who has gone through the mire, is unequivocal in his assessment]</b> For me, it’s a simple answer. And it’s that the responsibility lies with the adults, which is: the parents, the football clubs, everyone who is looking after the youth of today. I think they’ve all got a responsibility</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[QPR consultant sport psychologist Misia Gervis explains how dangerous it can be when someone base their self-perception and identity on their footballing skill]</b> It has to be about valuing the person first. Football is just something you do. It isn’t who you are, because the problems come when you invest in your identity and you have one identity. And then that identity gets taken away from you because you’re released - that is when you walk yourself to the edge of the precipice and fall off</p>
