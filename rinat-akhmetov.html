  <p><b>[Manchester United have been warned they will be expected to exceed Manchester City’s previous offer of €50 million if they are to sign Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk]</b> You know that we had negotiations with Manchester City this winter, and there was an official offer - a very big figure. They offered us around €50m for Fred. And we had enough strength to reject it, because we were playing in the Champions League, we were finishing the Ukrainian League campaign. We won the championship and the cup - in principle, our decision was correct. And I am convinced that we will receive and are receiving no less interesting proposals than that from Manchester City.<br /><br />We’ll get exactly the amount he costs. We can’t get a dollar if the player costs 50 cents. We don’t want to sell him for 50 cents if the football player costs a dollar. This will be a market price, the fair price, and it will be beneficial both for the club inviting Fred and for us. That is, I can somewhat feel that Fred will be more expensive than Fernandinho and <b>[Alex]</b> Teixeira</p>
