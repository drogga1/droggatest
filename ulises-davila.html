  <p><b>[Former Mexico, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> starlet Ulises Davila redefining success in New Zealand]</b> Failing would’ve been if I didn’t leave the country, if I hadn’t taken the chance, taken on the challenge. It would’ve been a failure for me if I hadn’t had the courage. For me, triumph in life is about doing well, enjoying my family, becoming a better person. I’ve enjoyed it, and for me that’s success<br /><br />Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the most important thing in life is how much you fought, how much you enjoyed and beyond winning or losing the important thing is that, being brave, taking risks and fighting for your dreams. That was the dream: to play soccer, to go to different places, and I feel happy and satisfied with everything I’ve done in my career<br /><br />In the short-term, my goal is to be one of the best players in the A-League and be able to win a championship with Phoenix. They’ve never won a title before, and I want to win one here as the best player in the season or one of the best players during the season. After that, see what happens in soccer, I’d love to continue here, I really like being in Wellington and my wife feels really good here as well<br /><br />We were seeing if there was an opportunity there. I was at home and the chance came up to see if I could come in and train for a bit, to help me stay fit physically. Honestly, when the chance in New Zealand came, I left, told them thank you and that I didn’t want to stay longer with <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a>, that I had to take this important opportunity for my career. We left on good terms, I thanked them and I told them that I was hoping to continue my career outside Mexico<br /><br />Everyone makes his own decisions. I’ve had good opportunities football-wise and economically that I’ve taken. I enjoyed India for the little time I was there - it was only three months with the club. Now here in New Zealand, I signed for two years. That’s why I made the choice to come because I felt like I’d be a very important player here, that I’d be happy here with my family and enjoying playing soccer here</p>
