  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Andriy Voronin Signs For Dinamo Moscow]</b> I had options to continue my career in Germany, and several in Russia, but in the end I opted for Dinamo <b>[Moscow]</b>. I liked the professional approach of the leaders of the Moscow club during the negotiations, and I also liked the conversation with head coach Andrey Kobelev. I believe the Russian league is of a very good level</p>

  <p><b>[Andriy Voronin Can’t Wait To Start Dynamo Moscow Adventure]</b> I liked the professional approach of the Moscow club’s officials during negotiations and I also liked my conversation with coach Andrei Kobelev. Dynamo are planning to clinch a <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League spot and even first place, and this means a lot. The Russian league is strong and very exciting and there were never problems with motivation for me. Dynamo are a new challenge and I’m tuning myself in as much as I can</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Liverpool striker Andriy Voronin says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> is a ‘jerk’]</b> Terry couldn’t clear the ball cleanly, so hit me in the face. Jerk! In my opinion, he did it deliberately. Terry is capable of wickedness. As are <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> and <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>. They are the masters<br /><br /><b>[Voronin cut short his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> stay in January when he moved for £1.8m to Dynamo after a lacklustre spell in the English top flight. And he didn’t have many kind words for the football he experienced at Anfield]</b> In England it’s carnage. If in a match one of the players doesn’t bleed, doesn’t smash his head in a collision or lose his leg, the fans feel cheated - the game was a failure. It’s a crazy pace from the first minute to the final whistle. Complete dedication, tremendous atmosphere in the stadiums, but the tactics of most teams are simple in the extreme: throw the ball 50 yards up the pitch and then mob rush up to the opposition goal to score</p>
