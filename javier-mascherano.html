  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> It’s the best trio I have seen. To say we will see nothing like it again, you never know. The most surprising thing is that they complement each other so well and each one of them brings us something different. That they get on so well and don’t let egos get in the way is not easy, it’s not easy to share the limelight the way they do. They do it naturally and modestly. They mark the way forward for the team. If the stars get on so well then it is up to the rest to follow that example</p>

It would have had consequences for the team and impact at the global level. Fortunately, everything has been resolved in a normal way with <b>[Messi’s]</b> return to the squad. We need to move on <b>[from the Copa America final defeat]</b> to achieve the goal of qualifying for the World Cup. We must look ahead because in less than a year we will know whether we will be going to Russia or not</p>

I hope I am remembered as a good person, and to be able to go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in 15 years and say hello to the fans, to have the doors open at a place I have been for so long. The titles are in the trophy case, but when this finishes it is the person who remains. I am delighted to stay in this house that has been my home for the last six years. It is the club at which I have spent the most time and that makes me happy, it is obviously a cause for great pride. It is not easy to stay so long in such a competitive, demanding club, my goal for the future is to maintain their trust</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano back <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> to return to Argentina National Team]</b> Anything can happen in the world of football and it depends on his desire to play in Argentina. There’s also the family aspect when he decides to live over here. These are personal issues and no one else can influence them. If he decides to come here in the future, it’d be a huge jump in quality for our league and the country<br /><br /><b>[Mascherano received a hero’s welcome in his homeland after joining Estudiantes back in November]</b> <b>[My return]</b> would be nothing compared to Leo.

It was no secret that I was close to signing for Inter Miami, I mean it was almost a done deal but things can change very quickly and at the end I chose Estudiantes de la Plata</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is from another planet!]</b> Whenever I refer to Leo I say the same thing. In football there is decision making and execution. Most players make good decisions, but they don’t execute them in the best way or the other way around. And he normally does both. And at the speed with which he plays, it’s different. In addition, Leo knows how to control and that allows him, within a game, to have seven, eight or ten important chances, at 100%. That is his ability to dominate the game. Normally, the game dominates us all. It takes you, you carry out different actions, because the rival or the game invites you to that. In the case of Leo, it is the other way around: he decides what to do or not to do with the game. So he’s from another planet.<br /><br /><b>[Mascherano is showing no sign of slowing down, but is approaching his 36th birthday and admits he may not have long left before heading into retirement]</b> I don’t know how easy or difficult it is to come back three or four months without playing, but my mind <b>[is made up]</b> to keep doing it</p>

  <p><b>[Mascherano hoping for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> return at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as he dreams of MSN reunion]</b> The other day, I watched the final in Berlin again and what the three up front created was impressive, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, Suarez and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Each of them had a position in the team, the pressure after losing the ball and control. They added a lethal edge to our play. I hope Ney returns to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and they play together. It would be so nice for the club and the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has made <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> a complete team]</b> The team that continues to surprise me with the evolution it has had is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It is clear that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has put it together in his image and likeness. I am 10 years behind, I see how we played with that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team it was nothing like what I see today. I have been following <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> since he coached <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, which was a pressing team similar to what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> does today but now he has added a way to spread out the play, when before it was much more direct. That evolution is what I like because, in the end, it ends up being a more complete team</p>
