  <p><b>[Barcelona will miss Javier Mascherano]</b> During the World Cup in 2010, Barcelona needed to replace Yaya Toure and I told Leo that I’d love to be considered. He talked to Guardiola who said: ‘But Mascherano won’t get a game if he comes here! ‘How can I put Argentina’s captain on the bench?’. But I told Leo to tell Pep that I wasn’t the kind of player who causes problems. I remember being called to his office in the Ciudad Deportiva soon after I signed.</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> It’s the best trio I have seen. To say we will see nothing like it again, you never know. The most surprising thing is that they complement each other so well and each one of them brings us something different. That they get on so well and don’t let egos get in the way is not easy, it’s not easy to share the limelight the way they do. They do it naturally and modestly. They mark the way forward for the team. If the stars get on so well then it is up to the rest to follow that example</p>

It’s clear Leo conditions our collective performance; I hope as his team‑mates we can meet his standards.<br /><br /><b>[Mascherano recognises that morale suffered badly on the path to the World Cup]</b> It all started off really badly with a defeat to Ecuador at home, then we went to Paraguay and drew. When we thought we might be able to make the jump, in the matches against Brazil, Colombia and Chile, an actual team started to appear, that’s when we went to the other Copa América in the US <b>[the 2016 Centenario edition, with the final staged in New Jersey]</b>, and ended up changing manager. After Tata <b>[Martino]</b> everything descended into chaos. Because we weren’t getting the results, because we were so needy, so lacking … because we changed manager again after that. There was such a sense of urgency. We were so close to the edge … one match away from not qualifying for the World Cup, it was a Calvary. Those of us who have been around for some time have seen the good times and the bad, facing up to the task and doing what’s needed along the way … luckily we’ve come through</p>

  <p><b>[Mascherano angrily denies Argentina player revolt against under-fire coach Sampaoli]</b> Ask all the coaches who picks the team. There have been seven, eight coaches and nothing has ever been said. That tag has been placed on our generation, who knows why, but this is repetitive: one person says, another says it and the snowball doesn’t stop rolling.<br /><br />There is a lot of myth in all of this. The best coaches in the world also ask for players’ opinions, because the players are the ones who make the decisions on the field. The coach doesn’t have to agree, he just wants to know how you feel on the pitch. It is not about imposing any opinions, but rather coming to a collective agreement over what feels best for the team<br /><br />I cannot stop a guy from sending an audio, I don’t know if it’s on purpose, or if the phones are bugged, I don’t know what to believe in now. I don’t even want to think about it, I believe in the 22 other guys here with me who I know and nothing else. Let everybody take care of their things, I am here to say that we are not playing well. I haven’t been in any videos or audios, whoever says that, it is up to them, I won’t answer for anybody else</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano has given no thought to his next outing for Argentina being his last]</b> I’ve not thought about that. I’d rather think about what we can achieve and try to do my best so that things turn out well. After that, fate will decide how our story ends.<br /><br />There’s no doubt that, until Croatia’s first goal, the match was pretty even. But then we lost our shape and organisation, and we ended up looking quite bad. That’s what was most worrying. We obviously know that results can vary and you often don’t get what you deserve, like in our match with Iceland. But to lose our shape like that - that’s not right. That’s something we’ll need to assess properly, because it can’t happen to us again<br /><br />The team is frustrated, not Leo. Let’s not put all the blame on him. We’re frustrated that things haven’t gone our way, but we have to accept that and try to get out of this situation we’re in. We have to be able to overcome such difficulties. We can’t just let things happen to us and then give up the chase. It’s an internal struggle that we need to win</p>

I hope these guys can accomplish something in the future. I hope that they can accomplish what we couldn’t today. We have to keep supporting them so they keep trying. Sooner or later, it will happen for them.<br /><br /><b>[He added in the wake of a 4-3 defeat at the Kazan Arena]</b> Football is like that. We had the game relatively under control, they scored a great goal and it’s hard to get up from that. France are a very good team</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano has come to the defence of his former Barcelona and Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi]</b> They always look for something to criticise him for. They said ‘he has to return’, and when he gets back, he’s the problem. He’s always the problem. I’m not in his shoes, but I can imagine he should be tired. The criticism is not about the game. They talked about how he dismissed himself after the Venezuela game, but they didn’t say anything about how he trained with the team for 10 days before the matches against Spain and Italy <b>[in March 2018, before the World Cup]</b> when he knew he wouldn’t be able to play. Do you know how many times he travelled to the USA, prior to some friendly game, knowing that he would not play, just to be with the team?<br /><br />Against Nigeria, we reached an agreement with Sampaoli, to solve some doubts that we were having on the pitch. He was always the manager. He made the decisions and decided the team. We spoke about everything with him. Sampaoli selected the team for the match against France. When you try to deny spaces on the wings, Mbappe will kill you. The plan was to defend on our side of the pitch and try to counterattack. Clearly, it didn’t work</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Mascherano says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is from another planet!]</b> Whenever I refer to Leo I say the same thing. In football there is decision making and execution. Most players make good decisions, but they don’t execute them in the best way or the other way around. And he normally does both. And at the speed with which he plays, it’s different. In addition, Leo knows how to control and that allows him, within a game, to have seven, eight or ten important chances, at 100%. That is his ability to dominate the game. Normally, the game dominates us all. It takes you, you carry out different actions, because the rival or the game invites you to that. In the case of Leo, it is the other way around: he decides what to do or not to do with the game. So he’s from another planet.<br /><br /><b>[Mascherano is showing no sign of slowing down, but is approaching his 36th birthday and admits he may not have long left before heading into retirement]</b> I don’t know how easy or difficult it is to come back three or four months without playing, but my mind <b>[is made up]</b> to keep doing it</p>
