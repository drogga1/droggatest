  <p>[Australian defender Josh Mitchell has revealed he kept himself afloat by playing poker before signing with Hong Kong Premier League club Eastern SC in July] It was kind of nice to have that break. I left Liaoning, came back to Sydney and was obviously waiting to see what happened, and in the meantime I actually played poker to keep myself afloat. So I would get up in the morning, go train, go to the gym, go running - whatever it was to keep fit - and then I’d play some poker in Sydney to pay the bills, so to speak. Then finally something concrete turned up, because I had a lot of near misses, and I was off to Hong Kong.<br /><br />[the complicated historical and political relationship between Hong Kong and China] It doesn’t get any bigger. I can’t wait. It’s going to be great<br /><br />Football here [in Hong Kong] is not young but it’s still developing and it’s changing. There is more investment coming into the game here, especially at some of the top teams, and they’re just trying to put Hong Kong football on the map. To show we’re here, we are a serious league, a serious set-up, we have some very professional teams, and to showcase that and what we have to offer</p>

  <p>[Eastern SC coach Chan Yuen-ting is the story heading into the 2017 AFC Champions League [ACL] group stage but the first woman to lead a men’s team in continental competition] There’s always media at training and a lot of the media comes to training to do stories on her or to speak to her and that’s normal, and she’s also very good with them. She keeps her distance … takes a couple of photos, give a quick interview and back to the training. There’s no mucking around… she handles it really well and from what I’ve seen it’s all very positive media attention but at the same time she knows she’s got a job to do and that’s manage the team. She’ll be the first one at training and she’ll be the last one to leave.<br /><br />[Chan is] very thorough, very enthusiastic and she wants to achieve great things. She wants to really push herself to try and improve … and she handles the pressure. You never see her waver. You never see her get frustrated. She’s a real model manager, someone who’s there to steer the ship, and she does a great job, so it’s been great so far<br /><br />She keeps that distance where the players respect her because she’s the manager. That’s something I’ve found really good because some managers don’t do that - they want to be your friend, they want to be your coach, they want to be everything and in the end they lose track<br /><br />She wants to win the title this year, you know, even with the ACL and everything else going on to say ‘I’m here and I’m the real thing</p>
