And I don’t think there are many occasions where they score from free-kicks or from balls into the box<br /><br />We showed good courage to get on level terms, but their second goal was disappointing. In the second half we looked like we were the more likely to score and when they got a third it took the wind out of our sails</p>

It was another sign of just how helpful he can be. I have had it before - he will send a text or call you up and he is always willing to give that help. He likes to see his old players stay in the game and he also understands how precarious it can be. Sir Alex is on record as saying you can be a good manager but you need luck</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has claimed his West Brom counterpart Tony Pulis phoned Ryan Shawcross to call him a loser after their match last weekend]</b> We were annoyed with a number of things. We were annoyed with their manager ringing up Ryan on the Monday morning after the game and calling him a loser. I wasn’t too happy with that either, but hey ho. Any number of things surrounding the game were, in our view, unnecessary. There was a voicemail left <b>[by Pulis for Shawcross]</b>. I haven’t heard it, but Ryan wasn’t too pleased and tried to ring back and didn’t get any answer.<br /><br /><b>[Berahino, who joined Stoke in the January transfer window, had been handed an eight-week ban for failing a drug test]</b> Under WADA <b>[World Anti-Doping Agency]</b> rules he wouldn’t have got a ban. It’s the FA that include recreational and out-of-competition testing. It was a low level misdemeanour. If it was a constant problem, he would have got a longer ban. He’s working exceptionally hard and doing work every single day. He’s not unfit, just not match fit and not quite ready to start games. The next two weeks we can really push him on and by <b>[the game against]</b> Tottenham he will have more capability to cope with 90 minutes</p>

He’s got a big smile on his face - there’s a weight off his shoulders and he just needs to get on with his career now.<br /><br /><b>[Hughes said Berahino will likely be involved when Stoke take on Tottenham in two weeks]</b> He’s match short, clearly, but we have two weeks away which will help him immeasurably. Likelihood is he’ll be involved versus Spurs</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has been backed to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United]</b> It’s been in the offing for a while it seems. There’s been a lot of discussion in terms of which club he was going to go to. There’s been a lot of talk about Chelsea but it looks like he’s going to go to Manchester United. From the outside, it looks as though Everton have already been spending the money they’re going to accumulate - it is a big chunk of money, you have to say. In fairness to the boy, for a number of years, he has been scoring regular goals at the top level of British football. Given that Manchester United have lost Zlatan, they clearly had to address that and they’ve gone for Lukaku.<br /><br />It will be a different challenge for him. Everton are a good club - I’ve played at both clubs. Everton are very much a family club, United - clearly since I left - it’s gone on to become even bigger on the world stage and it’s a huge entity now. Maybe he’ll find a little bit of a difference in that but his day-to-day work will be similar and I’m sure he’ll be a great success there</p>

We have prioritised adding further strength in depth to defensive positions this summer, and we have certainly done that by fending off any number of clubs who were all interested in taking Kurt on loan.</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton have named Mark Hughes as their manager, two days after sacking Mauricio Pellegrino]</b> It’s a challenge I’m excited by. It’s a great opportunity to come back to a club I know well, and a club I’ve got real affinity with, and I couldn’t turn that down. I bring experience of the Premier League. I understand what it takes in this league to win games. But first and foremost I think it’s about coming in and maybe being that different voice, that different message from myself and the staff, that will enable the players to recognise and focus on what needs to be done in this key period of the season. The objective clearly is to remain in the league and make sure we’re a Premier League club next year. That’s where this club needs to be, that’s where it should be, and that’s our intention to make sure it remains there.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Hughes was unhappy that Marcos Alonso had escaped a red card after a high boot caught Shane Long on the back of his calf at the end of the first half]</b> It was a poor challenge, a really poor challenge. It should have been a red card, clearly. I am disappointed that the officials didn’t see it. They were all within a 10 or 15 metre radius. I think between the referee, linesman or fourth official that one of them should have seen it. It was a poor tackle, it was a tackle that thankfully had no drastic consequences for Shane. Thankfully he is okay, he just got a rake down the calf. Clearly, with Chelsea down to 10 men and us in first half on the ascendancy, it is a slant on the game really. Those are key moments and referees have got to get them right, maybe that’s why the <b>[Premier League]</b> referees are not at the World Cup this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is in danger of missing Chelsea’s FA Cup semi-final clash with Southampton after being charged with violent conduct]</b> Shane has got a real gash down the calf. Having seen it again, it’s a clear red card. There’s intent to hurt Shane in my view. It’s a rake down the back of the calf. It’s a dangerous tackle. It could have broken his leg. There were three officials within five or 10 yards of him so how they all missed it is beyond me. I’m not sure but I don’t think Alonso was booked. Maybe people have to look at that situation again retrospectively. The referee didn’t give a free-kick. It’s not sour grapes, we’re not trying to get fellow professionals in trouble but a decision needs to be made on that as it wasn’t acceptable. These are key moments and referees have got to get them right. Maybe that’s why they’re not at the World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have come a huge distance]</b> The name of Man City does not resonate like the Real Madrids, Barcelonas and Man Uniteds of this world, yet. I say ‘yet’ because if they continue in the same vein and have the ­resources to go into the market like they have done in recent times, then clearly they will become a huge power in world ­football. But it takes time and it is only the early stages.<br /><br />When I ­became manager of Man City they were just a mid-table Premier League team. What is that, eight years ago? They have come a huge distance in a short space of time, so you can’t start saying they are the best there has ever been ­because you need to do it over a longer period. They have the potential and ­resources to be able to affect the top end of the ­Premier League and European trophies for 10, 15 years. And they could well become the team of this generation, like United and Liverpool before and Chelsea and Arsenal in between. It is up to everybody else to try to stop that. Irrespective of all the resources at any one time you can only play 11 players. You might have 11 ­exceptional players, but the teams around you might have that as well. Now the Premier League is not a ­British league or a ­European league, it is a world league</p>

Clearly at the top end of the pitch we’ve been struggling for someone to give us a spark to set us off to score more goals and create more chances. He’s got unbelievable pace. It was important that I had a look at him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> environment because he could very well be someone we can use. Bringing on Michael late on in games as an impact sub could be something that will help us. I was pleased with what he did, he didn’t look phased by the stage he was on so that bodes well as something we can work on. We’ll see how he progresses. He’s been playing well in the Under-23s and getting goals so he’s deserved his chance</p>

I went there with Stoke and scored twice against them and it made them angry and we ended up getting beat 7-2. That’s what happens. You have got to go there with the attitude we have worked well, our training has been good, we are in a confident frame of mind in terms of our defensive work, so let’s use that and see where it takes us</p>

  <p><b>[Martial isn’t a natural striker but looks happier]</b> He’s always had that potential. He’s a young guy trying to find his potential in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> shirt. I think he’s maybe looking to take on responsibility, and he needs to do that. His first two goals <b>[against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> were great finishes, striker’s finishes, which you always like to see from the guy playing down the middle. I think he is enjoying playing with the two guys either side of him - <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and <b>[Mason]</b> <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> - there is a lot of interchanging of positions, and that is the way he likes to play that role. He doesn’t like to be stuck in the middle of the park. At times, he looks like that movement to get involved doesn’t come naturally to him when he’s got his back to the goal, he’s happier when he links the play in a deeper position and then drives into the box and gets on the end of things. He looked like he was enjoying his game more than maybe he usually does - he gives this impression that it’s all a little bit too much like hard work for him, but he worked his socks off and got the reward with the goals<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Martial can be regarded as a long-term option down the middle for United]</b> I think everyone accepts that around 26/27/28 years of age, that’s when you are at your peak as a top-line player. So he has got a number of years to go before he gets to that point. He is never going to be an out-and-out scorer who will score you 20-30 goals a season. I don’t think he’s scored anywhere near 20 goals in a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season yet, but if he nails down that position in the middle rather than being put out onto the wing, then that will affect his ability to get on the end of things. If he says to himself ‘I’m going to be the main striker here, I’m going to be playing down the middle’, then I think he’ll get more goals</p>
