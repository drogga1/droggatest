  <p><b>[Birmingham City Sign <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> On Season-Long Loan]</b> I have always said that Joe is a really good young keeper, and his talent was obvious to <b>[goalkeeping coach]</b> <a href="kevin-hitchcock.html">Kevin Hitchcock</a> and I from the outset. His contribution to the team prior to <a href="shay-given.html">Shay Given</a>’s arrival was fantastic, but by loaning him to <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>, he will add invaluable experience to that already gained here at City. I know he will relish the prospect of regular <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> action, which is vital at this stage in his career.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil had a hand in all three <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goals as they chalked up their seventh consecutive victory by comfortably beating Stoke]</b> We are disappointed with the manner of the goals, we lost three goals to set plays and that’s not something we usually do. And I don’t think there are many occasions where they score from free-kicks or from balls into the box<br /><br />We showed good courage to get on level terms, but their second goal was disappointing. In the second half we looked like we were the more likely to score and when they got a third it took the wind out of our sails</p>

  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I know the pressure he has had to endure over such a long period, so for him to keep driving himself forward and driving his team forward is a fantastic achievement</p>

  <p><b>[So many managers during the past 30 years have spoken about how open Ferguson is to receiving telephone calls and sharing his thoughts, but the track record of those who have followed suggest that even the grand old master of soccer management can only do so much to he]</b> It was a private conversation: we just talked about football. It was another sign of just how helpful he can be. I have had it before - he will send a text or call you up and he is always willing to give that help. He likes to see his old players stay in the game and he also understands how precarious it can be. Sir Alex is on record as saying you can be a good manager but you need luck</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton manager Mark Hughes has praised Michael Obafemi for his performance against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in their 6-1 loss on Saturday]</b> It was something I wanted to have a look at. Clearly at the top end of the pitch we’ve been struggling for someone to give us a spark to set us off to score more goals and create more chances. He’s got unbelievable pace. It was important that I had a look at him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> environment because he could very well be someone we can use. Bringing on Michael late on in games as an impact sub could be something that will help us. I was pleased with what he did, he didn’t look phased by the stage he was on so that bodes well as something we can work on. We’ll see how he progresses. He’s been playing well in the Under-23s and getting goals so he’s deserved his chance</p>

  <p><b>[Martial isn’t a natural striker but looks happier]</b> He’s always had that potential. He’s a young guy trying to find his potential in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> shirt. I think he’s maybe looking to take on responsibility, and he needs to do that. His first two goals <b>[against Sheffield United]</b> were great finishes, striker’s finishes, which you always like to see from the guy playing down the middle. I think he is enjoying playing with the two guys either side of him - <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and <b>[Mason]</b> <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> - there is a lot of interchanging of positions, and that is the way he likes to play that role. He doesn’t like to be stuck in the middle of the park. At times, he looks like that movement to get involved doesn’t come naturally to him when he’s got his back to the goal, he’s happier when he links the play in a deeper position and then drives into the box and gets on the end of things. He looked like he was enjoying his game more than maybe he usually does - he gives this impression that it’s all a little bit too much like hard work for him, but he worked his socks off and got the reward with the goals<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Martial can be regarded as a long-term option down the middle for United]</b> I think everyone accepts that around 26/27/28 years of age, that’s when you are at your peak as a top-line player. So he has got a number of years to go before he gets to that point. He is never going to be an out-and-out scorer who will score you 20-30 goals a season. I don’t think he’s scored anywhere near 20 goals in a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season yet, but if he nails down that position in the middle rather than being put out onto the wing, then that will affect his ability to get on the end of things. If he says to himself ‘I’m going to be the main striker here, I’m going to be playing down the middle’, then I think he’ll get more goals</p>
