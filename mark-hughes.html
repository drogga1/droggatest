It was another sign of just how helpful he can be. I have had it before - he will send a text or call you up and he is always willing to give that help. He likes to see his old players stay in the game and he also understands how precarious it can be. Sir Alex is on record as saying you can be a good manager but you need luck</p>

We were annoyed with their manager ringing up Ryan on the Monday morning after the game and calling him a loser. I wasn’t too happy with that either, but hey ho. Any number of things surrounding the game were, in our view, unnecessary. There was a voicemail left <b>[by Pulis for Shawcross]</b>. I haven’t heard it, but Ryan wasn’t too pleased and tried to ring back and didn’t get any answer.<br /><br /><b>[Berahino, who joined Stoke in the January transfer window, had been handed an eight-week ban for failing a drug test]</b> Under WADA <b>[World Anti-Doping Agency]</b> rules he wouldn’t have got a ban.

He’s working exceptionally hard and doing work every single day. He’s not unfit, just not match fit and not quite ready to start games. The next two weeks we can really push him on and by <b>[the game against]</b> Tottenham he will have more capability to cope with 90 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has been backed to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United]</b> It’s been in the offing for a while it seems. There’s been a lot of discussion in terms of which club he was going to go to. There’s been a lot of talk about Chelsea but it looks like he’s going to go to Manchester United. From the outside, it looks as though Everton have already been spending the money they’re going to accumulate - it is a big chunk of money, you have to say. In fairness to the boy, for a number of years, he has been scoring regular goals at the top level of British football. Given that Manchester United have lost Zlatan, they clearly had to address that and they’ve gone for Lukaku.<br /><br />It will be a different challenge for him. Everton are a good club - I’ve played at both clubs. Everton are very much a family club, United - clearly since I left - it’s gone on to become even bigger on the world stage and it’s a huge entity now. Maybe he’ll find a little bit of a difference in that but his day-to-day work will be similar and I’m sure he’ll be a great success there</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma has completed a season-long loan move to Stoke City]</b> Kurt is undoubtedly one of the most talented young defenders in the game, so naturally his arrival will enhance our playing squad for the forthcoming campaign. We have prioritised adding further strength in depth to defensive positions this summer, and we have certainly done that by fending off any number of clubs who were all interested in taking Kurt on loan.</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City have signed Kevin Wimmer from Tottenham for £18 million]</b> Kevin is an undoubted talent and he will significantly add to the quality of the group of players that I already have at my disposal. We put a real emphasis on trying to enhance the defensive areas of the squad this summer and we feel that we have been able to do that. We brought Kurt Zouma in earlier in the window and managed to bring Bruno Martins Indi back to the club following his loan spell last season, so bringing Kevin here too, a player I admire greatly, gives me real strength in depth in those central positions.<br /><br />Obviously this deal was with a view to the future because we know that Kurt is a Chelsea player, but Kevin is our player now and we knew that this deal wouldn’t have been available to us this time next year. There is a lot of money being spent this summer, so for us to get a player of Kevin’s calibre through the door for the price we have paid, in my opinion, is something we will really appreciate for years to come</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City boss Mark Hughes believes that Chelsea will miss out on the ‘dark arts’ brought by Diego Costa]</b> If you look at Costa, he was brilliant at taking it up to the edge, then stepping back, and it affected opposition teams. Maybe they don’t have that ability with the dark arts right on spec at the moment. I don’t know the whole circumstances, but from a football fan’s point of view I think he’s a loss to the Premier League.<br /><br />I used to enjoy watching him play because he had an edge to him and the reaction of other players to him was really interesting. That’s a skill in itself. You can take it right to the line and then step back and get other people into trouble because they haven’t got that skill to stop where they should do. He was great at it and that’s why I like watching him play.</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke have lost seven of their last eight games against Liverpool]</b> We will certainly contemplate changes because we are facing tough weeks leading into Christmas now, so most clubs will try and use their resources, just as we will. We are playing against a high-quality team, who will test us, but I fully expect us to give a real good account of ourselves. We are facing a player in Mohamed Salah who is clearly in the best form of his Liverpool career. We can’t be overly concerned with one player though because they have match winners all over the pitch. We need to nullify them on Wednesday.<br /><br /><b>[Geoff Cameron won’t be involved for the hosts]</b> We’ve had everyone in for training and there doesn’t seem to be any doubts from the weekend. There’s a few bumps and bruises but we’ll have a clearer idea tomorrow. Ramadan <b>[Sobhi]</b> is fine. We didn’t know how long Mame Diouf would last on Saturday and needed cover on the bench which is why Saido Berahino missed out. He’s in my thoughts for Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Hughes not worried about Stoke’s Premier League place]</b> I don’t do relegation. There are a lot of managers who have a badge of honour that they’ve never been relegated. I’ve never been relegated because I’m too busy trying to get in top 10s. I’ve never been near it so I’m not going to start now, am I?<br /><br />I don’t see how it can compare. We had 12 games at the start of the season when we didn’t win a game. We got four points out of 12 games. Here we’ve played 17 games and got 16 points. It’s not comparable<br /><br />It’s harder as a manager because as a player you can affect things on the pitch. You can do something about it. Pressure as a player never really affected me. It was always the bigger the game the better in my view. As a manager it’s different. When you lose as a player you can take comfort from the fact you may have played well. As a manager if you get beaten you take the responsibility. You think it’s your fault and 30,000 in the stadium know it’s your fault! But you accept that and you don’t come into this business if you’re not able to deal with it</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton have named Mark Hughes as their manager, two days after sacking Mauricio Pellegrino]</b> It’s a challenge I’m excited by. It’s a great opportunity to come back to a club I know well, and a club I’ve got real affinity with, and I couldn’t turn that down. I bring experience of the Premier League. I understand what it takes in this league to win games. But first and foremost I think it’s about coming in and maybe being that different voice, that different message from myself and the staff, that will enable the players to recognise and focus on what needs to be done in this key period of the season. The objective clearly is to remain in the league and make sure we’re a Premier League club next year. That’s where this club needs to be, that’s where it should be, and that’s our intention to make sure it remains there.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Hughes was unhappy that Marcos Alonso had escaped a red card after a high boot caught Shane Long on the back of his calf at the end of the first half]</b> It was a poor challenge, a really poor challenge. It should have been a red card, clearly. I am disappointed that the officials didn’t see it. They were all within a 10 or 15 metre radius. I think between the referee, linesman or fourth official that one of them should have seen it. It was a poor tackle, it was a tackle that thankfully had no drastic consequences for Shane. Thankfully he is okay, he just got a rake down the calf. Clearly, with Chelsea down to 10 men and us in first half on the ascendancy, it is a slant on the game really. Those are key moments and referees have got to get them right, maybe that’s why the <b>[Premier League]</b> referees are not at the World Cup this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is in danger of missing Chelsea’s FA Cup semi-final clash with Southampton after being charged with violent conduct]</b> Shane has got a real gash down the calf. Having seen it again, it’s a clear red card. There’s intent to hurt Shane in my view. It’s a rake down the back of the calf. It’s a dangerous tackle. It could have broken his leg. There were three officials within five or 10 yards of him so how they all missed it is beyond me. I’m not sure but I don’t think Alonso was booked. Maybe people have to look at that situation again retrospectively. The referee didn’t give a free-kick. It’s not sour grapes, we’re not trying to get fellow professionals in trouble but a decision needs to be made on that as it wasn’t acceptable. These are key moments and referees have got to get them right. Maybe that’s why they’re not at the World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have come a huge distance]</b> The name of Man City does not resonate like the Real Madrids, Barcelonas and Man Uniteds of this world, yet. I say ‘yet’ because if they continue in the same vein and have the ­resources to go into the market like they have done in recent times, then clearly they will become a huge power in world ­football. But it takes time and it is only the early stages.<br /><br />When I ­became manager of Man City they were just a mid-table Premier League team. What is that, eight years ago? They have come a huge distance in a short space of time, so you can’t start saying they are the best there has ever been ­because you need to do it over a longer period. They have the potential and ­resources to be able to affect the top end of the ­Premier League and European trophies for 10, 15 years. And they could well become the team of this generation, like United and Liverpool before and Chelsea and Arsenal in between. It is up to everybody else to try to stop that. Irrespective of all the resources at any one time you can only play 11 players. You might have 11 ­exceptional players, but the teams around you might have that as well. Now the Premier League is not a ­British league or a ­European league, it is a world league</p>

It was important that I had a look at him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> environment because he could very well be someone we can use. Bringing on Michael late on in games as an impact sub could be something that will help us.

  <p><b>[Martial isn’t a natural striker but looks happier]</b> He’s always had that potential. He’s a young guy trying to find his potential in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> shirt. I think he’s maybe looking to take on responsibility, and he needs to do that. His first two goals <b>[against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> were great finishes, striker’s finishes, which you always like to see from the guy playing down the middle. I think he is enjoying playing with the two guys either side of him - <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and <b>[Mason]</b> <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> - there is a lot of interchanging of positions, and that is the way he likes to play that role. He doesn’t like to be stuck in the middle of the park. At times, he looks like that movement to get involved doesn’t come naturally to him when he’s got his back to the goal, he’s happier when he links the play in a deeper position and then drives into the box and gets on the end of things. He looked like he was enjoying his game more than maybe he usually does - he gives this impression that it’s all a little bit too much like hard work for him, but he worked his socks off and got the reward with the goals<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Martial can be regarded as a long-term option down the middle for United]</b> I think everyone accepts that around 26/27/28 years of age, that’s when you are at your peak as a top-line player. So he has got a number of years to go before he gets to that point. He is never going to be an out-and-out scorer who will score you 20-30 goals a season. I don’t think he’s scored anywhere near 20 goals in a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season yet, but if he nails down that position in the middle rather than being put out onto the wing, then that will affect his ability to get on the end of things. If he says to himself ‘I’m going to be the main striker here, I’m going to be playing down the middle’, then I think he’ll get more goals</p>
