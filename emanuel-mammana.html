<blockquote>
  <p>[Emanuel Mammana has always had to grow up quickly] I thought it was a joke. They told me that I was going to get called and it took another 10 minutes before [Alejandro] Sabella called me. I didn’t know what to say.<br /><br />Finding someone to be with me everywhere, like my girlfriend and her father, really helped me. I was in a bad way when I lost my father, they made me move forward because I did not want to do anything anymore. Since I lost my family, River became my second home, because I was staying in the boarding house when that happened to me. The club really helped me a lot, I was supported by the people there, the coach and everyone else</p>
