  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s out of this world overhead kick against Juventus deserved to set a new Champions League record]</b> It was a big game - a quarter-final. Having scored nine consecutive goals in the competition, to score your tenth in a game like that in the way he did … Both goals were really good, especially the bicycle kick which was just out of this world. The height he kicked it at was unbelievable.<br /><br />He came as a young lad but he knew what he wanted to become, and he also said it: ‘I want to be the best player in the world’. At the beginning you think: ‘OK, he’s a young lad - keep dreaming’. But the work-rate and talent he’s combining has made him achieve his goals, and he’s still going strong. It’s fantastic<br /><br /><b>[On Pressed for his selection]</b> In goal, Edwin van der Sar. For Man United and Holland he was amazing for a long period of time - he was on the top of his game. Jaap Stam, one of the strongest, quickest, aggressive centre-backs I played against - also good on the ball, too. Then Andres Iniesta: the way he plays is fantastic to watch, everything is with technique and vision. He’s done it for 10-15 years, too. I have two more and that has to be the two who are dominating world football over the last 10 years, destroying every record in football that was there. It’s Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. I think that’s a pretty decent team</p>

  <p><b>[Mohammed <a href="mohamed-ihattaren.html">Ihattaren</a> has already made his Eredivisie debut despite his tender age, much to the delight of Under-19s coach Ruud van Nistelrooy]</b> The way he has developed is spectacular. I thought he was going to need at least a season to develop and get used to things, but he has developed as a rocket really. There’s a big future ahead of him. But it’s a matter of putting in the daily work to develop yourself and to get the maximum out of yourself in every aspect. I think that’s his biggest challenge<br /><br /><b>[Following in the footsteps of <a href="mohamed-ihattaren.html">Ihattaren</a>, <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a> and Zoet is something American youngster <a href="richie-ledezma.html">Richie Ledezma</a> will be dreaming of at this stage of his career]</b> Richie adds something special, that’s why we brought him in. He’s making a difference in midfield with very quick thinking, passes, movement, he can score a goal and he’s creating chances for the whole team. He’s a very promising talent, I was really happy to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Inside the managerial mind of <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> legend Ruud van Nistelrooy]</b> The reason that I’m coaching and training is to help players develop, share my experience and train and coach them to the next level. I love that process and that’s why I do this. I experienced the situations that the players are in now both on and off the pitch. I know what’s being asked and then it’s up to my qualities as a person, as a coach to get the players there where we want them. And that’s what I love about the job. I think that I look at the players’ perspective. It’s not that I impose my vision on a group of players. I obviously have my ideas on how to play, but I think I want to create a team from the players that I have as individuals, the personalities and the footballing qualities. I want to combine that into what’s best for that group of players<br /><br />So in that sense I’m starting to analyse first what I have and what I’m going to work with and then I’m building a team and a style of play that suits the qualities. The measurement of success is always the player. Without the will of the player there’s nothing. I have to follow the player’s lead where he wants to go and guide him the way I feel he should be guided. I think that’s the way I work and the way we work as a club. Values are important, education is important. It’s not just about getting people here and developing them as football players, no, I think the human side is just as important<br /><br /><b>[Having been in his current role for a little over a year now, Van Nistelrooy has come to the realisation that the best way to learn is still to just get yourself out there and experience what it’s like to be a coach]</b> It is quite challenging. Many former managers and coaches that I spoke to told me I just needed to get on with a coaching job and experience it. Only then would I know and feel what it’s all about. And I think they’re right. I obviously did all my coaching badges and you learn and everything and that helps, but I think by actually starting and doing it and making your decisions yourself in every aspect of an individual, a team, a staff within the club you work for, yeah, that’s what it’s all about<br /><br /><b>[While his predecessor Van Bommel enjoys a close relationship with former Netherlands coach - and father in law - <a href="bert-van-marwijk.html">Bert van Marwijk</a>, Van Nistelrooy has a number of managers to fall back on for advice]</b> I learnt so much from the managers that I worked for and I took bits from training sessions, from the way they coached, the way they talked, the way they are as human beings. I was fortunate to work with the best, with very different styles of management and different styles of play as well. It’s great to be able to call former coaches and managers and to talk things through what I am experiencing as a coach. I don’t have one guy like Mark has, but I do like to call Foppe de Haan, a coach I had at Heerenveen. I’m mostly in touch with him and it’s fantastic to learn from his experience</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who now coaches <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>’s Under-19s side on <a href="mohamed-ihattaren.html">Mohamed Ihattaren</a>]</b> He joined us from the U17 team in the U19s but he was younger than everyone, so I thought he’s going to need at least a season to develop and get used to things, but he developed like a rocket really. He joined the winter break training camp with the first team last season and he just blew everybody away. That’s not normal with a player who is 16 years of age, of course. I was saying to him: ‘I want to develop you so that you will make the step to the first team and then I don’t want to see you back here anymore.’ That’s the way I think it should be because for players who go and come back it’s very difficult. He managed to develop himself at such speed that he left and we never saw him come back.</p>
