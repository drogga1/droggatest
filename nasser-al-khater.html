  <p><b>[Qatar 2022 World Cup to have a robust security plan]</b> Every tournament has its risks and this is typical with any major event. As long as we have a robust security and safety plan, you are able to minimize destruction as much as possible. The good thing is that we have started working early. We have started working with Interpol <b>[International Police Organisation]</b> and ICSS <b>[International Centre for Sport Security]</b> from very early on.<br /><br />What’s good is that we work with security and police forces of various countries that have a large database of people who have created trouble in the past. We are fortunate that the information sharing is taking place. We hope to minimise the people who in the past have caused trouble, from being involved in the World Cup. I think that’s an important thing that we shouldn’t ignore<br /><br />There was never a World Cup which had 12 year lead time also! I think Khalifa’s refurbishment is not just for the World Cup as it will host the 2019’s World Athletics Championship. We will have stadiums ready relatively early as compared to other World Cups. We have a deadline of 2020,<br /><br />I think it’s going with the trend. I think Asian football is rising. It is becoming more competitive. There is a lot of investment from Asia especially from China in football. Technically too, the football is improving. It will be 20 years since Asia last hosted the World Cup. So it will be a source of immense joy and pride for the people of the region and Qatar<br /><br />Look obviously, our slogan was ‘Expect amazing’. We wanted to be true to that but also we promised an innovative World Cup. I think we are sticking to that promise as well. The amount of research going into this World Cup is immense. We have a new type of signature grass that is made for the region. We have the solar fuelled helmets, the cooling vests and the stadium alert system<br /><br />There is a weather station at the construction sites too. If the temperature goes beyond a certain point, the alarm goes on and the workers stop working. Because of the heat in Qatar after a certain temperature the work has to stop. It used to be done manually but now this one is completely automated. To answer your question, yes there was a drive. We wanted to be innovative and there was a drive to be sustainable. There was a drive to develop spot beyond just football</p>

  <p><b>[Nasser Al Khater acknowledged that Qatar has worked hard in order to be a knowledge hub for the footballing world]</b> There has been a lot of research that has went in. Dr. Saud has done immense research in World Cup related projects. We have been getting a lot of requests in the last two weeks to help with cooling stadiums. It’s nice to see that your expertise, which is ground breaking, is something which we are being asked to give advice on. We have been asked to give advice on the pitch management too.</p>

  <p><b>[The 2022 World Cup in Qatar is expected to be a 32-team competition, the campaign’s CEO Nasser Al-Khater has said amid talk that it could be expanded]</b> Let me make this clear. There is still a feasibility study taking place right now. There is also a consultation process that is taking place right now. At the end of the feasibility and the consultancy process, we will be presented with the findings. Ultimately, the decision stays with us - we, with the state of Qatar. The state of Qatar has bid for this as a World Cup of 32 teams in Qatar. The country is still open to looking at the feasibility study. We now, as a joint venture responsible for organising this World Cup, we are working on the plans of a 32-team World Cup in Qatar. Subsequent to that, I think by June we will know the direction that will be taken and at this point, we are working towards a 32-team World Cup in Qatar.<br /><br />We have no doubt that the amount of activities on the entertainment side, on the hospitality side and on the food and beverage side is going to be something unforgettable. However, experiences in the desert that we are paying special attention for the fans to see, as an overall package, we believe it’s going to be something quite unique that the fans will enjoy. When it comes to the subject of alcohol, it happens to be a subject that the media has always raised. Yes, Qatar has always been a conservative country. However, Qatar is a hospitable country. Hospitality is in our DNA and we make sure that people will come and visit or who live there feel hospitable. We understand that it is in some people’s culture to drink alcohol. Alcohol is legal in Qatar. It might be a little bit more restricted as compared to many other countries. However, it is available. During the World Cup, we will make sure that there are designated areas where people who want to enjoy their drink can enjoy their drink</p>
