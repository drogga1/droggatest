  <p><b>[Rodrygo has admitted to feeling nerves ahead of his impending arrival in Real Madrid]</b> Of course it motivates me to be at one of the biggest clubs in the world. That can also scare you but that fear is good because it motivates you even more. I want to prove why this club believed in me and signed me<br /><br /><b>[He added on leaving Santos, who have nurtured him to this point]</b> I have mixed feelings as I’m leaving the place where I’ve been since I was 10 but at the same time, I feel good because I leave knowing I’ve done a good job here. Who knows, perhaps one day I will return. I always had the pressure to be the successor of players like Neymar and Robinho but I never worried about that. I just focused on training and being ready</p>

  <p><b>[Asked if a report that Madrid managed to seal the transfer in under half an hour]</b> I always said I preferred Real Madrid and when they came I didn’t even have to ask questions, so 20 minutes and it was all done. There was no issue and everything was in place so it was very quick. I think everyone who knows me since I was a child knows I’ve always been a Real Madrid fan. I always told my dad I’d play for Real Madrid and when they came I didn’t have any doubts at all.<br /><br />I’m a fast striker, I score and dribble. I’m Brazilian and we’re like that. I identify a little with Robinho and Neymar. Neymar is a great player, but he’s on another team and I cannot talk about him<br /><br /><b>[On whether he would like to be the Neymar of Madrid]</b> No, I would like to be the Rodrygo of Real Madrid. There is only one Neymar, there won’t be another</p>

I am typically more used to operating on the wings, but that is what the coach wants. It’s a position in which I am comfortable and enjoy<br /><br /><b>[Rodrygo netted eight league goals in 35 games for his former club in 2018 as he was largely deployed on the left-wing]</b> I am not sure whether I will be playing in the first team yet. It is up to Zidane and his staff to decide where best to utilise me<br /><br /><b>[Discussing his superb debut goal]</b> I always used to take free-kicks at Santos, that is why I asked to take it.</p>

The confirmation on Wednesday that Marco Asensio ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Arsenal comes as a huge blow for Real Madrid. Brahim Diaz, Takefusa Kubo and Rodrygo are all in an uncertain situation at the Santiago Bernabeu and the club are analysing the trio in detail to decide whether to keep them in the first team, drop them to the Castilla side or ship them out to another club</p>

<p>: 2019 08 01
Rodrygo or Kubo? Real Madrid face an impending dilemma over who will fill their non-European Union quota spots for next year following the impressive off-season form of Takefusa Kubo.</p>

It was a surprise, I admit, and I was nervous, but I really enjoyed this. The coach told me to go out and enjoy the experience, but to concentrate on the defensive duties he’d detailed for me, too. My objective now is to go back to Madrid and keep working hard, day by day, and see how far my efforts can take me. Boy, I’m enjoying this, though - it’s a bit of a dream come true!</p>

I am still a very young player to talk about filling the place left by someone like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who is one of the greatest players in the history of the club - if not the greatest. I don’t want to weigh myself down with the pressure of replacing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.<br /><br /><b>[The youngster has made a big impression in the Spanish capital but is surprised by how quickly his career has taken off]</b> You always try to make sure you are fully prepared so that things turn out well, but I could never have imagined that everything would happen so quickly.<br /><br />It’s all come as a huge surprise to me. Only a short while ago I was hoping to make my Champions League debut <b>[…]</b> and maybe at the most score a goal. Scoring a hat-trick like I did was something nobody expected. So I can’t really explain how I felt after the game. All I could do was enjoy a special, once-in-a-lifetime moment.<br /><br />Learning the ropes as a footballer isn’t just about what’s done on the training pitch. There is a big mental part too, preparing yourself so that success doesn’t go to your head and knowing how to handle fame and to not be presumptuous. <br /><br />On that side of things, it helped me a lot that my father was a footballer, and that gave me a head start on the mental part. I watched him go through things that are happening to me now and so I know I can’t let all of this attention go to my head.<br /><br /><b>[Rodrygo was left on the bench for Madrid’s 4-0 win over Eibar on Saturday but is primed to make his senior Brazil debut]</b> I feel fulfilled. It has always been my dream. Since I was a boy I have dreamt about representing the national team and playing alongside the best players in the world - players whose careers I have been following for a long time. So being here gives me happiness that I can’t begin to put into words. Everything that has been happening in my life makes me feel very happy</p>
