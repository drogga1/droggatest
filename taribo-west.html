I was told clearly that nobody could force out <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> because he was a godfather in the club. Because I had a good relationship with <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Massimo Moratti</a>, I called him to tell him what was going on.

  <p><b>[In January 2000, Taribo West moved to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> after being frozen out by Inter, but only played four games before being shown the door. This came as quite the shock to him, who felt that he was the best defender at the club, better even than the legendary Paolo Maldini]</b> In 2000, I played the African Nations Cup with Nigeria and when I returned <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> was injured. I played the games in his place but I was told clearly that nobody could force out <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> because he was a godfather in the club.

He admitted that not understanding the French language was a major part of the problem as his agent represented his own interest]</b> I played in Auxerre for free. I was playing under a contract for five years without knowing the content and conditions binding the contract.

I saw the details of what I had signed. Where my fellow defenders were earning as high as 120,000 French francs, I was going home with 3000 French francs<br /><br />I wanted to set Auxerre on fire that day. Immediately, I called my manager who was turning me left and right <b>[while]</b> enjoying himself in Senegal<br /><br /><b>[West said the issue persisted when he switched to Italy to join <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> giants <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> in the summer of 1997]</b> One day I went to see my coach after training where I met a certain manager who told me about five clubs were interested in signing me up.

He began to make calls and Inter was the destination, I signed the contract papers without knowing its content yet again</p>
