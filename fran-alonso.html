<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Behind Glasgow City’s battle for Scottish football supremacy with <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> and Rangers]</b> Nobody was happy with a draw. That, when you’re playing the champions of the last 13 years, a team that is still in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, is a massive statement. Not in the sense of quality, but just in the sense of desire, passion and ambition<br /><br />We want to be like the men. We want to be the most dominant team in Scotland. We want to be like Glasgow City has been for the last 13 years. A club like <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> has to win titles. We don’t have the pressure from the club that we have to win the league, because they know the game very well and things cannot be changed suddenly. It’s a developing process that has to be put in place, which we are <b>[doing]</b>. But that doesn’t mean that it is impossible. I would like to see <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> winning the league in at least the next three years. There are three or four clubs in the country that have the same goals and only one can win, so it’s going to be challenging. But if in three years, we haven’t won the league, for me, that would be a failure</p>
