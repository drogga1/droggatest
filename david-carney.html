<blockquote>
  <p>[Sydney FC winger David Carney has declared nothing less than success will do for the Sky Blues as they attempt to finish their brilliant season with an A-League championship] We will win and that’s it. It’s been built in us since day one this season - we win every game and no-one at this club thinks about losing.<br /><br />I remember we started off very slow and they had a couple of chances at the start - for some reason we were a bit flat. They were on top and we were lucky to still be 0-0 after 25 or 30 minutes. The first 20, I don’t think I was the greatest myself. It took a good run or something like that to get into the game - sometimes you need that.<br /><br />When you’re a kid you just want to start off well but sometimes you need that little bit of good fortune to set you away and get you into the game. I think our experience in that team at the time overcame it. We had the likes of Dwight Yorke and Steve Corica scoring the winner and that sort of got us over the line. I remember the second half we seemed to dominate them, but it’s a long time ago<br /><br />It’s surreal in a way where you win it when you’re just starting off your career and now I’m coming to the end of my career and I’m playing it again. I started that one but I’ve just got to be there for the boys and hopefully when I do make an impact it’s a good one. I seem to do well against Victory so I’m happy we’re playing them</p>
