<blockquote>
  <p>[Former club captain Mick Martin says Rafa Benitez leaving Newcastle is a disaster] Yes, it’s been a disaster, to be honest with you, and I have to say I didn’t think it would come to this, because Benitez seemed happy to be in his position at Newcastle. Other than the fact there’s a couple of issues that needed to be sorted out. He loves the crowd, he loves the area, he’s done great work with the team, and he just wanted a couple of things made clear to him. In other words, a couple more quid to invest, and control, and help with transfers. And on top of a few quid more on his wages, so I think he would have deserved all that, the crowd would have been happy. But unfortunately, it’s come to this stage where there’s going to be turmoil around here.<br /><br />The problem you have facing you now, is an appointment of a new manager. Now a new manager comes in, straight away you have to hit the ground running, because if he doesn’t, results aren’t good, then the crowds are going to start booing him, booing Ashley, and everything is going to be up in the air. Whoever does come in has got to be strong and handle the pressure of replacing Rafa Benitez, because if he doesn’t he’s going to get buried up here. There is one little possibility that might happen, if there is a sale of this club prior to the season starting, it wouldn’t be beyond the new owners to go to Benitez if he hasn’t got a job by then to bring him back. I read that somewhere and thought ‘God, that’s a good idea’, and if there was a sale that could possibly be on</p>
