  <p><b>[Robert-Louis Dreyfus questioned the abilities of the coaching staff at the club in addition to president Pape Diouf, however, despite admissions from Gerets himself that he was angered by such comments, Jacquet does not think that this is the primary reason for the Belgian departing the Stade Velodrome in June]</b> For some time there was a vagueness in the statements made by Erik Gerets, but I did not really believe he was going to quit. It shows that he had a difficult year, a complicated season. But it’s not just that in my opinion. He is worried about the future of Marseille. It is well known that Marseille are a great club … if he wins the French title, there must be continuity <b>[in their success]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Jacquet has backed OM to make the most of their two point advantage over Girondins de Bordeaux and close out the title]</b> It is clear that the players are very close to their coach and will keep going until the end. I think they will make him happy</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup Winning Coach Aime Jacquet Backs France Trainer Raymond Domenech]</b> Our French team is changing. The coach is forming a new group of talented young people. But it is not like that. A team is built. It is the pleasure of the coach – perhaps the only one. I have confidence in this team<br /><br /><b>[While lending his backing to the current regime, Jacquet said he would also castigate those who have been vocal in the stadiums against <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a> and his charges. He was particularly critical of those Saint-Etienne supporters who chose to whistle <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> and his <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> team-mates in the French side simply because of their club affiliation – OL are Sainte’s traditional rivals]</b> These whistles made me feel very bad. I had a pain, almost shame. Being whistled when a team loses or plays poorly, I have known. These French players were whistled because they were Lyonnais. The environment of the team worries me. I hope we can be more together</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup Winner Aime Jacquet says Four Years Of <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Raymond Domenech</a> Is Too Much For France]</b> When holding a position like his, which was also mine <b>[from 1993-1998]</b>, four years is enough! After that, it’s too hard. There are too many settings that prevent you from working well. That’s what I blame the FFF for: they do not understand the substance of the job of a coach. It’s a job that you can fill for only four years because it is a position so exposed.</p>

  <p><b>[Aime Jacquet believes France’s new generation will prevail over a Germany side he says are in decline]</b> They are our eternal rivals. They are a fearsome adversary, but not unbeatable. They have a generation coming to the end of its cycle and I hope that, with our new generation, we will be able to come through this test. It will be very difficult. I saw Germany against Italy and it was a tight and tactical contest.</p>

  <p><b>[Jacquet had <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> in his side for his crowning glory 18 years ago and spoke of his admiration for the France boss]</b> He knows how to handle things. He has all his experience as an exceptional player and a coach at the highest level and a wonderful personal journey with the France team. He’s been in this situation as a captain with me and I can assure you he’s controlling everything perfectly behind closed doors. That’s another reason why we’re lucky to have players who have played across Europe. Didier played in Italy, England and Spain – and what a fantastic collection of trophies he has.</p>
