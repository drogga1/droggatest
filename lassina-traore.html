  <p><b>[Burkina Faso starlet Lassina Traore relishing <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> challenge]</b> I’m really excited and looking forward to my new journey. What counts in my favour is that I have been here before and I know the culture of the club. My aim is to play regularly but in order for me to do that I have to show them that I can add value to the team, you know. Hence I’m prepared to work hard and be committed to the club. I would like to thank Mr Ari Efstathiou <b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> Cape Town CEO]</b> and everyone at the club for the love they have shown me during my time here. It was a very enjoyable experience and they made my stay in Cape Town very warm, especially Louis de Faria and his wife where I was staying during my time here. Thanks to all of you that played a role in my career</p>

  <p><b>[Lassina Traore talks about his first days at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and an interaction he had with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]</b> He asked me if I had a PlayStation. I replied ‘yes’ and told him I’d sold Huntelaar on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> because he was too old. He replied that when he’s the coach of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> he will send me back to Burkina Faso</p>
