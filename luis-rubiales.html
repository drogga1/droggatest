The decision of the <a href="rfef.html">RFEF</a> is to trust <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a> as the coach. He will continue on the same duration of the contract that was already signed. He will be in charge of taking us to Euro 2020 and of doing a good job if we qualify</p>

As a result, it failed to materialise, with Rubiales labelling the Relevent deal as worthless without support from the governing body]</b> <a href="javier-tebas.html">Javier Tebas</a> spoke to everyone except the people he had to speak to. It’s a total lack of respect, unfaithful and incomprehensible. This president demands a lot from others when his own behaviour frankly leaves a lot to be desired. We’ve not had even a single call. I haven’t seen the contract. Put bluntly, he’s rude. He has signed an agreement that it is not up to him to sign. What he has signed is worthless. It means nothing without our authorisation</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rfef.html">Spanish FA</a> president aiming to avoid playing behind closed doors]</b> There is no date. We valued May 31 and communicated to the Royal Household.

  <p><b>[Luis Rubiales, the president of the <a href="rfef.html">Spanish FA</a>, has hit out at coronavirus testing for footballers as irresponsible in the current climate]</b> I think it is irresponsible when there are patients with much more at stake than a competition, with life itself at stake. It is not appropriate to be using tests <b>[at clubs]</b> when there are people who need tests. It fails to see reality.<br /><br />We are all confined to home; it doesn’t make any difference if you have been infected or not. It’s the same outcome <b>[isolation]</b>. And if someone does have severe symptoms, that’s the person who needs the test. Not a footballer. He is going to be isolated anyway.<br /><br />The authorities have said this: ‘If anyone has a test, masks, gloves, hand them over.’ Hospitals are running out. There’s someone sending tests to clubs: that’s a lack of solidarity, it could even be illegal. He should be ashamed. We don’t want that, and it’s anti-patriotic.<br /><br />When all this is over, when fewer people need it, then maybe we will consider testing players at our clubs but for now, tests have to be for those that need it. We all have to lend a hand.<br /><br />It would a tremendous injustice not to finish the season. We are not going to declare it void, we want to finish it. We don’t even know when competition will restart. We are in the hands of what the health authorities say. We can’t guess the future</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Rubiales criticised clubs for taking testing kits away from more vulnerable members of society]</b> Knowing the lives of many people are at stake it seems out of place to me to use tests on footballers when there are people that need them. The result for the player is the same, if they are positive and don’t have severe symptoms they will be confined at home. Testing players seems unsupportive and absolutely anti-patriotic in these conditions</p>

We can’t just relegate teams now. Teams have to be promoted by right. There are hundreds of teams waiting to complete the season. When the country recovers, that will be the moment to complete the current season. Let’s hope I’m mistaken and that we can play at the start of May. I don’t think that’ll be possible, but I’d love to be proved wrong, we’ll have to extend the calendar. The objective is to save this season.

We believe the deadline should be health, integrity and safety. Mainly when the country takes back the normal situation</p>
