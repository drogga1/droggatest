  <p><b>[Julen Lopetegui has been sacked as manager of Spain, after taking the Real Madrid job]</b> We have decided to fire the national coach. What we have achieved in getting here is due in great part to him, and we must thank him and wish him luck.<br /><br />I don’t feel betrayed. Lopetegui has done impeccable work. How all this has been done is something else. I have spoken with the players and I can guarantee they will do everything, along with the new coach, to take the team as far as possible. Real Madrid look for the best coach, that is fine by me. I have no opinion about how Real Madrid act. But the federation have an obligation to represent all Spaniards. I found out <b>[about the deal with Madrid]</b> five minutes beforehand and asked for nothing to be done, that I was getting a plane and coming here. But, after five minutes, I saw it in the press and we had to react. We have a responsibility. I know there will be criticism but the values of the RFEF are set by the RFEF itself. To win is very important, to have the best coach is very important, but above everything is acting in the right way. Maybe this is tough now, but in the end it will make us stronger<br /><br /><b>[Rubiales has not revealed who will be in charge for La Roja’s opening game of the tournament]</b> We are going to touch as little as possible. We are working on it. When we know we will tell you. All this is a big blow, but we are training again later today, we will stay together and move forward. The players are very focused and they have told me they are fully committed and will give 100 per cent</p>

The Federation cannot be left outside the negotiation of one of its employees and find out just five minutes before a public announcement.</p>

I haven’t seen the contract. Put bluntly, he’s rude. He has signed an agreement that it is not up to him to sign. What he has signed is worthless. It means nothing without our authorisation</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Rubiales, the president of the <a href="rfef.html">Spanish FA</a>, has hit out at coronavirus testing for footballers as irresponsible in the current climate]</b> I think it is irresponsible when there are patients with much more at stake than a competition, with life itself at stake. It is not appropriate to be using tests <b>[at clubs]</b> when there are people who need tests. It fails to see reality.<br /><br />We are all confined to home; it doesn’t make any difference if you have been infected or not. It’s the same outcome <b>[isolation]</b>. And if someone does have severe symptoms, that’s the person who needs the test. Not a footballer. He is going to be isolated anyway.<br /><br />The authorities have said this: ‘If anyone has a test, masks, gloves, hand them over.’ Hospitals are running out. There’s someone sending tests to clubs: that’s a lack of solidarity, it could even be illegal. He should be ashamed. We don’t want that, and it’s anti-patriotic.<br /><br />When all this is over, when fewer people need it, then maybe we will consider testing players at our clubs but for now, tests have to be for those that need it. We all have to lend a hand.<br /><br />It would a tremendous injustice not to finish the season. We are not going to declare it void, we want to finish it. We don’t even know when competition will restart. We are in the hands of what the health authorities say. We can’t guess the future</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Rubiales criticised clubs for taking testing kits away from more vulnerable members of society]</b> Knowing the lives of many people are at stake it seems out of place to me to use tests on footballers when there are people that need them. The result for the player is the same, if they are positive and don’t have severe symptoms they will be confined at home. Testing players seems unsupportive and absolutely anti-patriotic in these conditions</p>

When the country recovers, that will be the moment to complete the current season. Let’s hope I’m mistaken and that we can play at the start of May.
