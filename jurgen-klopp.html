He scored a nice goal <b>[against Netherlands last Thursday]</b> and that will be good for him. But our only problem is the pace in which developments obviously have to happen in football. You always get asked about a new player in a new club after a really short time of being able to train together, that’s our only problem. Everything else is fine. I hope that in three years we’ll look back and no one remembers the first five or six games. He needs time to integrate in this team; we need time to develop our team play. Now we could have had the time for it, but now <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> is injured. Of course we’ve got <a href="shinji-kagawa.html">Shinji Kagawa</a> as well but he hasn’t played with the team yet. Everything is far from perfect but we’ve got to stabilise our game while we collect results. Most likely we have to do that with a new player in the starting line-up who will have to reclaim his self-assurance as well. That will be hard. When Ciro came back he seemed very relaxed, I think he was very glad his injury wasn’t as bad as feared. The bruise hurts a lot at the beginning but it heals quite fast</p>

It was an intense game for us and a deserved win at the end. There is a lot to analyse. This was the most defensive team <b>[Sunderland]</b> I ever saw in my life. Sunderland always play a defensive style and that is okay. We forced them to be that. It is the most difficult thing in world football to come through but we stayed concentrated, worked for the moment and found a way.<br /><br />The excitement is in the detail and that means you have to celebrate before you score a goal and push the team on if possible. It worked out. It’s important the crowd know about the importance of their support<br /><br />It is an ankle injury but we can’t say anymore until we see a scan. Roberto Firmino got a knock on the calf as well. That should not be that serious.</p>

We have all the skills, but you need to be patient. If you score the first goal early, then we get the second, the third, the fourth. It opens the game but it is all about the timing of when you get the first and the longer you don’t, the most important thing is you don’t get frustrated because we need to get used to situations like this. Last year the games were different with a few teams played defensively against us. This time, because we are better, we have forced them into situations like this.</p>

That’s great for us as a club, and I think for him it’s perfect because being a manager is a job you have to learn. When a person like Steven Gerrard - the player he was, but more the person he is - is ready to make the steps, that’s wonderful news for football. Combining the playing experience with all the things he’ll learn from now on, that’s a bright future and is brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Sturridge is in a race against himself]</b> I thought the Southampton game, from the physical side, was a really good game from Daniel Sturridge. He was really involved from the first second to the last. There was not a big difference between the first half and the second half and all that stuff. Usually, and it’s not about speed or anything, Daniel Sturridge scores twice in this game with the chances that he had. But he’s a human being and he missed chances - that’s all. Of course, longer injuries and more injuries means you lose some, not speed, but the 100% trust in your body for sprinting. Ask a sprinter, it’s high intensity and if you have a few injuries, everything takes a little bit of time afterwards, but it’s not lost forever. Daniel’s in the best age for a football player, and so if he can stay fit, everything will be fine.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool still on course to beat Manchester United in Champions League chase without their Super Mane]</b> The big problem was in January, and I’ve said it a few times, is that it was not only Sadio missing. Of course, everybody would miss Sadio - Southampton still miss Sadio probably, Red Bull Salzburg miss him, so we have nice company! But it was such a hard moment in January. We had these games, we had the derby, then we played Stoke, then we had City, then we played Sunderland, then we played the <b>[League Cup]</b> semi-finals. It was not the freshest moment of the season, I would say, and then missing Sadio in the shape he was in, plus missing Phil and all that stuff - it was not perfect, but that’s how it is.<br /><br />We have 59 points, we are in a nice position in the table. Yes, a few teams have played less than we have, but they cannot win them all, that’s for sure because a few of them play against each other. We are in a good position and I really want to use this position. I said at the beginning of the season that the whole season is pretty much to prepare to finish. This is the finishing part of the season, there are eight games for us and nobody asks for your problems, everybody only wants results. We want the same, we expect results from ourselves and we want to fight for everything<br /><br />That’s what we’ve done all the time, even if maybe sometimes it didn’t look like this, but I thought more often <b>[than not]</b> everybody could see that we are really fighting. That will still be like this and for this we need not only an atmosphere in the stadium, we also need a positive mood within the club and around the club because the situation is positive<br /><br />As a manager, I can’t really remember the last time I had all players available and decisions to make were so difficult that I thought ‘oh my God, I’m leaving five players at home and really good players on the bench’ because that’s really rare. So, the only job to do is to play the best you are able to and not think about who you miss and all that stuff. Now, let’s go</p>

Atleti left the game to us and said ‘come on’.<br /><br />In the first half, we had a few nice moments where we had some good crosses.

To take in the good things. To enjoy our development.<br /><br /><b>[does Klopp feel Liverpool fulfilled that hope?]</b> I would say - ‘yes, done!’ It was good because finishing in the top four and getting to qualification for the Champions League hasn’t happened too often for the club in the last few years. It could have been better - we could have ended higher and been already in the Champions League without needing a play-off. But I think it’s really important in life that you value what you get - you think, okay: we did good in this, were the best in this, need to work on this and here’s the result, now for the next steps. I loved big parts of last season, we had a few hard moments but overall most of it was enjoyable. If we learn from our setbacks, it becomes an even bigger positive<br /><br />We have to be spot on, 100 per cent, to make our lives easier. We need to improve our defending in one-on-one situations. We dominated the game against Crystal Palace but <b>[Wilfried]</b> Zaha and <b>[Andros]</b> Townsend - okay two tough wingers to face - but it’s a one-v-three situation and they still come out with the ball. This is where my players have to be better, be tougher. If you look at some of the goals we’ve conceded, it just doesn’t make sense. We’re a completely fair team - we don’t make fouls on purpose and I like it, but we need to make real challenges. If you look at Burnley last season, we get opportunities to win the ball so many times, we didn’t - ‘oh, 2-0 Burnley’<br /><br /><b>[Klopp admits that, at times, Liverpool have been too self-critical]</b> With us, one mistake and we were punished every time last season. So, when we spoke as coaches and management about our mistakes, we said ‘that’s not good, that needs work’. Then, we watch the analysis of the next five games to see our opposition make those same mistakes a few times and not be punished. We make it one time again, concede, and then we make a big fuss about it: ‘This is how we have to change it, we need to do this, this, this’. We have to use the information from the mistakes, yes, and we have to find solutions, but we must also be fair <b>[to ourselves]</b><br /><br />We always need little signs. When we score early, it’s like ‘voooooooom let’s go!’. When we don’t score early, it’s like ‘no, what can we do? There’s no space. They’re defending deep’. We need to be our own sign, to have confidence in our abilities and our way. All of the players can still climb to the next steps and take their good moments and make them great - consistently. But you cannot surprise yourself all the time and think ‘that was good, wasn’t it?’ Yes, it was good, but it must not be a shock, it must be the minimum you expect from yourself so you can push on</p>

Since then I have followed him and when I heard it may be possible to sign him I didn’t need to think twice.<br /><br />I hear a lot of talk about positions but let’s talk about the player; he is someone with really good abilities who always gives everything for his team.

Already he is a very, very good player and I think he has the mentality and desire to get even better - and that excites me.<br /><br />This is someone making a tough decision to leave one great club and come to another great club and I think he had many options, so to get him means I am delighted. He didn’t make an easy decision but I think he made a great one to go on this journey with this squad of talented boys and our great supporters. I welcome him to the Liverpool family</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp went straight back to the dugout and sat next to his assistant, Zeljko Buvac, to run through what he had just seen]</b> The first goal starts in a situation in the midfield when we can shoot the ball easily away. Emre is a little bit late in the situation, that’s the first moment I realise something will happen.<br /><br />Until then, it was a nothing situation. That’s a press ball, in the half-space on the left-hand side, and in the end, I think it was through the legs of Dejan, I don’t know exactly how it was.

In a game like this, usually you score more often than we did tonight, so nobody should rely on this that we try that often and don’t score.

It’s not about this, it’s kind of this being dominant and losing a little bit the grip on the game. That’s all space for improvement for all of us. We need to learn to be dominant and not to give easy goals away and the first one was, for sure, not necessary and too easy. The second, I have absolutely no clue how they came through that, to be honest, I have to see that again. It’s not a general defending problem but we have to improve, 100 per cent</p>

A mistake they all made in their life - but it is like, ‘he is a £65 million signing, he will improve’. Why do you think the other one cannot improve? I don’t understand that.<br /><br />For me it’s really difficult always to come to your planet, visit you and say ‘yeah you’re right, there were five good options out there and we missed them because, I don’t know, we wanted to spend the money anywhere else’. It is not that we ignore it - I said if there would have been a solution out there we would have done it. I had to make a decision and the decision was our boys are not worse than them. It is concentration. It is not a quality thing. But if there’s no-one, no solution out there, and no real quality issue then you have to work on it and that is what we will do.<br /><br />I believe in trust.

It feels strange, it feels wrong, but it’s a fact - we drew.<br /><br />Why we feel so disappointed or frustrated is because we all see what this team would be able to do. Seven changes and playing that kind of football - nobody should take that for granted, it’s pretty rare, so that’s good. Obviously we have quality and now we have to use this quality consistently, that should be the plan<br /><br />Could Trent have won the first headed challenge? Yes.

  <p><b>[On Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]</b> I think it would be strange if I have to say something about a player after two-and-a-half weeks when Arsene Wenger said this after working together with him for six or seven years. But a new start is very often kind of a relief. You are in a situation in your old club - I don’t say this for Alex especially, just in general it is like this - you are in a specific position and accept it and then at some point it’s difficult to make the next step.<br /><br />It’s how it is. So I thought it made complete sense for Alex to change the club and especially for him to come here. So far I can’t see that <b>[he struggles to believe in himself]</b>. He has settled in perfectly, but he knew all the England players and a few others. He’s really nice lad so it’s easy for him to settle in the team, he takes the situation like it is.<br /><br />He knows he played all the games for Arsenal from the beginning and now he comes here and is sitting on the bench and it looks like ‘oh it was not the best decision’, but it’s about the long term. We can already use him and that’s good, but we also want to prepare him - that’s all. It’s all good<br /><br />I thought in the last game, he played like a Liverpool player - highest intensity, was involved, was not fixed in a position. I saw already a lot of things. At the end, he didn’t hit a goal so maybe people will say that’s a proper Liverpool player - doing everything right and then at the end he doesn’t score. I’m really happy to have him here. I hope he’s also happy to be here<br /><br /><b>[When asked how Oxlade-Chamberlain’s development could be furthered under his charge]</b> It’s just because we play different to Arsenal. That doesn’t mean better or worse, it’s just means different. At least being involved in a different football <b>[style]</b> is already development because it helps you react in different moments, so that’s not always doing the same.<br /><br />Arsenal changed a lot of since Alex is there. I’m sure they didn’t always play with three in the back, wing-backs and stuff like this. I played against Arsenal when Alex was centre-mid, I played against Arsenal when he was on the wing, I played Arsenal when he was wing-back. He played different positions and that all is highest quality.<br /><br />If you can play in the Premier League in different positions, that says a lot of you. It’s a judgement from outside that you don’t develop. But playing different positions is development. When Alex was probably 18 or 19, people thought he could be ‘the man’ - how a lot of people think a lot of the time pretty early. How I say, you immediately put a rucksack on their back. That makes development not easier, so hide them as long as makes sense. That’s the plan. But he’s now in the perfect age and is still able to make big steps</p>

He can be happy with his performance and I’m very happy with it.<br /><br />We play good football in general. We are in a good way. We do a lot of things that you do when you’ve worked a little bit longer together. Yes, we still have issues. Yes, we lose challenges. Yes, because of the defence discussions it doesn’t help a lot if you make a mistake in defence, but it still will happen with all different line-ups, we will concede goals in the future.<br /><br />A little bit too much today, maybe one for sure too much and one goal you can concede at Leicester. We could have defended better before they could cross around the second goal, that’s the 100 per cent truth. In modern football that’s maybe rare, I’m not sure, but we want to be successful together. That means we always feel bad together when it’s not that good. We’ve felt quite average the last few days, and today much better</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s profligacy and a moment of poor decision-making saw them draw a second Champions League game they should have clearly won]</b> We, in this moment, are not the luckiest team in world football, so it’s not that things go easy for us.<br /><br />We did really well in creating chances against a very defence-orientated team. We didn’t give a lot of chances away for them; the free-kick they scored with was not a foul, so it’s difficult to change this. In defending if you win the ball clear and there’s still a whistle it’s difficult, but it was a brilliant free-kick. We made our equaliser, we scored and we could have created even more chances, that’s the crazy thing.<br /><br />We did enough and we had four or five 100 per cent chances and that’s then disappointing but it is like it is. In the Champions League in the group stage the only target you have is to go through the group to the next round, and that’s still possible for us.<br /><br />We know now more about two teams in the group and both games we could have, or should have, won but we didn’t. In the end that’s always our fault, but we will carry on and carry on like this, or even better. I saw a lot of good things tonight, it was not a perfect game, but there were a lot of good things.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s crisis of confidence threatens to crank up pressure on Klopp]</b> I played a lot of times with different teams in my life really badly and we’ve got a point. Afterwards, it feels like you’ve won a point, but you know you have a real problem because you have to play better next game - otherwise, you will not get a point. We do it the other way around. We are the better team again, we create more chances again, we are in very promising situations and then we don’t score. That’s of course a problem but it will not stay like this. I know, I’m long enough around football to know that there will be one day when the knot opens and maybe then we’ll score times than once, that’s pretty likely.<br /><br />It was only one game! Everybody gave points away, even Chelsea - okay, not too often because they were champions at the end, but it happened. It’s all about how you handle these situations and it’s something we are really working on to be stronger in<br /><br />What we have at the moment is that everybody wants to help where the first ball is. You see this very often - we come too close together where the first ball is, which means when the second ball comes, we don’t have a good formation. We really work on this, but I would say around these situations, there’s not the same confidence<br /><br />Players make the right decisions when they have confidence, when they don’t have it, then they feel ‘next pass needs to be the goal’ or ‘now we are under pressure and need to force it. No! You stick to what you’re doing, try, try and try again. Each missed chance is not a failure, it is information - use it and go again<br /><br />We create, we play good, but obviously we don’t score in these moments. But there are different ways to get one win in seven. You can play really bad and lose a lot of games or you play in a few games really, really good - I’d say in most of the games actually we were the better side - but a few chances are enough for the opponent to score, and we need a lot more and have at the end the same number of goals. That happens too often of course in the last few weeks, but the only alternative for us is to carry on<br /><br />We have to do it like this. We can’t say we won’t try it from now on and get more passive, come here and we are the counter-attack team and hope that something happens - I don’t think that is the right way for us. We are having obviously our hard moment, and other teams will have theirs in the season.

We were sure he can help us. Michael Edwards, Dave Fallows and Barry <b>[Hunter]</b>, they were really in my ear and were on it: ‘Come on, come on, Mo Salah, he’s the solution!’. When you have 20 players on the table, different players, it’s difficult to make an early decision, but we all were convinced about it so we could make the early decision so we could really get him. He’s a fantastic person, a nice lad and a really good football player. There is so much more still to come from him.<br /><br /><b>[For the opener, Salah delivered a curling beauty into the far corner from 20 yards out after Roberto Firmino dispossessed Dusan Tadic and Gini Wijnaldum spread the ball to him]</b> It was not a real chance from there I would say. It was a fantastic goal</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool are now in the Mo Salah period]</b> If you see Roberto <b>[Firmino]</b> working unbelievably hard, he’s not scoring in the moment. Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> doesn’t score in the moment. But they work and they will have their moments and then we will talk about them. There’s the guys on the bench who will have their moments. This is the Mo Salah period - no problem with that, well deserved. But he’s also very important even when he’s not scoring because he stretches the formation.<br /><br />The speed of the boys means the last line drops - there can be no other reaction. And then we have the space to play. The speed players aren’t only for counter-attacking. Sometimes that’s not possible. It’s about stretching formation and creating space for the rest.<br /><br />I don’t think it’s like this. Maybe it was one reason he came back, but he’s not like ‘now I will show you the real Mo Salah’. He’s completely relaxed. For sure he wanted to show a little bit he’s better than that, but everyone knew it already. He was a kid when he came to Chelsea, and we have heard a few times that’s quite difficult, and in that time they were really successful. It was quite difficult to come through.<br /><br />A little bit less muscle, a little bit less physical, and you fly through the Premier League - not like he’s flying now - but one body check, you understand. With his body shape that’s now different. He’s a man now, he was a kid at Chelsea, now he’s a man. That’s good</p>

It’s normal that you try to control the game then, but a team like we are have to control the game with the ball - and we didn’t play football anymore.<br /><br />We became a little bit passive, they scored the first one and it was obvious the atmosphere changed immediately. It gave them a big boost. Until the second goal, we were reacting but after the second goal I think it was an open game again. We could have scored off counter-attacks, but we didn’t. We opened the door for them and didn’t close it anymore, so they could score in the last minute and that was the story of the game. It was a misjudgement. We wanted to play like we played the first half but, of course, control the game a little bit.<br /><br />Why should we take a lot of risk? But then you become a little bit passive and that makes no sense, it doesn’t work. Free-kick, penalty, we scored twice from a set piece in a fantastic first half but two goals came from a corner.

If you always big up what people are saying on social media then we talk about it as if it is the truth. Even if they are pundits it doesn’t mean it makes sense, it is only like creating a story. I heard a lot of things about what people said about this or that. We have to accept it at times but we should not suffer all the time.<br /><br />Of course, Jordan can play the No. 6. He played it for England, he played it for us. In this game, I would love to see one of the big pundits being on the pitch and in a game like this be the person who changed the whole game. That really is fucking legend. It really never happens.<br /><br />Could he change the game on the pitch? No. Was he too deep in a few positions? Yes. Does that make me think he cannot play the No. 6? No, of course not. Can he improve? Yes. But did he improve already a lot? Wow, 100 per cent.<br /><br />He is a proper captain. Meanwhile, he wasn’t when I came in but only because he didn’t know how to do it because nobody had to think about how to be captain at Liverpool because they had one for 20 years. From the first moment, whatever he <b>[Henderson]</b> is doing it is not good enough because even when he is good he is still not as good as the other one was. I have no problem with that. We can all improve but it is not about the position 6 or whatever. We had to do much better in all positions.<br /><br />We spoke about a lot of things but not about the role of Jordan Henderson in this specific formation because it was not an issue. He was not better than the others unfortunately, but he was not worse. How you can say he needs to be better because he has the captaincy I will never get this kind of talk.

  <p><b>[Klopp hails ‘unbelievable potential’ of £35m Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]</b> He is on a very good way. I like it, but he has so much potential it’s unbelievable, what he still not shows. It’s only just the beginning and I really like it, I really like it. He’s like a wonderful package, I can only say. Hopefully he stays fit, that’s the most important thing. He can be much more decisive in a few moments. <b>[He’s sometimes a]</b> little bit too much of a midfielder instead of a striker - there are a lot of things he can improve, but I’m really happy about the status quo.<br /><br />We don’t really think a lot about it. It’s more that you see the last game and you see the other guys in training - because the guys who didn’t play train much more. And if they show up in these moments you think ‘Oh, that’s cool’. That’s why we do it. We trust the full squad, that’s the first and maybe most important thing. I said it and I have no problem: I make the decision so I get the criticism for the decision. I don’t want people to say ‘Wow, fantastic rotation!’ because I don’t need that. I do what I think is right.<br /><br />That cannot work all the time unfortunately, but it should work pretty often. So far, it’s OK. We had a really fantastic period, a little interrupted by two results and one performance; I really liked the Everton performance, not too much the West Brom one. But the next game is waiting, Arsenal away. That’s not a children’s birthday <b>[party]</b> - that will be really hard but should be hard for both teams. There is something possible for us</p>

I’ve seen it since I’ve been in England and for sure, it’s not right. But he’s still there and he’s doing a brilliant job again. Top five, six, fighting for fourth and being involved in different cup competitions and things like that. He’s obviously still very ambitious and as long as you feel that, you can stay. If you are the only part who likes it, that’s wrong. It needs to be a perfect fit. We feel that here at Liverpool in this moment and I’m sure for the next few years, but you cannot force anything to happen. It needs to feel right for everybody</p>

Because of Adam’s quality and attitude in training, it looks immediately like we can put him in, but physically he’s not fit. The two things that happened after his big injury were in the 10 or 15 minutes after he came on. From nil to 100 in a second, and that’s maybe what caused the problem. We really tried to be sensible with it, to do the right thing. But it didn’t work, twice. It’s really not a big thing, three games is like not being injured. He’s maybe available for Tottenham, and if not then he’ll have missed three games. That’s really OK but, of course, it’s not cool. The body needs to adapt again to the intensity.</p>

Swansea was good, defensively, and he was involved in the two biggest chances we had. West Brom was a bad game for the whole team and then we thought it makes sense to rotate.

We don’t ignore the goals we conceded, but if you ignore them for a second you would say, ‘OK, that’s how you have to play’. Don’t take too much risk, you pass, you come around the touchline, you have the crosses, you have the set-pieces, you have the finishes from distance, 18 yards, all these things. We had these things in pretty much all moments, but we didn’t score. Because we put pressure on ourselves obviously, that is not helpful for your confidence if you are 2-0 down at Manchester. So we passed, crossed a few balls that were not too good but <b>[then]</b> we found our way back on track minute by minute and second half we chased the game really.<br /><br />I think we deserved the goal and then it was the situation with the best piece of football in the whole game, the one-two between Roberto and Sadio and a clear foul and no penalty. That’s hard, but not to change anymore. I think with all the minutes around the two goals we conceded then a draw would have been deserved for us, but because we made these two mistakes we have to take the result like it is.

Nobody could know that he could play as a striker. We learned it step by step. We didn’t know exactly that he’s capable of playing in the centre. But we will not treat him like: ‘You don’t have to train, Mo - just come on Saturday for the game and we’ll see you there at Anfield or whatever.’ He doesn’t want that. He’s in the moment of his career but he knows there is a lot for him to come. He wants to learn and he wants to improve<br /><br />Sometimes he needs a little … reminder. A lot of my players need that. Don’t misunderstand me, it’s only a thing. If you talk about Roberto Firmino, he loves running in that direction and chasing the players.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp says the success enjoyed by Manchester City rival Pep Guardiola is not witchcraft]</b> His teams are always excellently positioned. He always has great teams which make excellent decisions. At Barcelona it was Xavi, <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, <b>[Sergio]</b> Busquets, Lionel Messi and so on, just to mention the creative players from his time there. At Bayern he had fantastic players who made a lot of great decisions. Now, with <b>[Ilkay]</b> Gundogan, <b>[David]</b> Silva, <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero, <b>[Leroy]</b> Sane, <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling and Gabriel Jesus, they’re extraordinary. Positioning is important but this is not witchcraft. It is not unusual just because the wing-backs come inside but when the players are in position they move every millisecond in order to be available. And when they are, that’s when the individual quality of the player becomes important. So they’re already well positioned on the pitch, they know what’s going on around them, they are very well orientated and they can pass the ball into the next area. That’s what makes them extraordinary. Whenever they can’t pass they use their pace in order to progress further up and then the space on the wing is free<br /><br />There’s no big difference, actually. It’s just that Pep has always had better teams than me. You can see that now with Manchester City - they have a lot more points <b>[in the Premier League]</b> than we do. However, that difference has never been as small as it is now. When we coached at Bayern and Dortmund respectively, that difference was really big. And when he was coaching Barcelona I was at Mainz, so that was a completely different situation. They’ve got a lot more ball possession than I ever had in my coaching career. They were always world-class teams and we always had to improve a little bit. When you have more ball possession, you don’t need to worry too much about what you need to do when your opponents have the ball</p>

I think it is now clear that he is making the same impact in England that he did in Spain and Germany, in terms of creating a team that is capable of beauty and dominance.<br /><br />I hope everyone involved can embrace the joy of being part of it, rather than allowing the intense focus to create pressure that numbs the excitement. I am someone who loves football. I have since being a very small child and I don’t envisage that changing until my last breath is taken. And what I love about football is that it offers all the most intense emotions and experiences for the period of time the game is being played and we all get to experience it together. It offers us collective joy, collective pain, collective tension and collective hope and belief. It brings a mass of people together, where in the split-second - the specific moment - we all experience and feel the same thing, at the same time.

He knows and appreciates absolutely this club, and the other boys really respect him for all the work he’s doing. This constant discussion about whether he’s under-valued or whatever in public, this never happened for one second either in the club or in the team. He feels completely comfortable and is planning for the long-term here. That’s becoming rare because if you are not Barcelona or not Real Madrid then there’s usually another club somewhere you can go to. It’s really good news for us. He’s absolutely a big factor in our future.<br /><br />This is one very important step. Absolutely. But even Roberto cannot play alone! We need to carry on in this way. In the moment every player knows about our plans. He’s the first <b>[to commit]</b> but for sure he won’t be the last<br /><br /><b>[On Roberto Firmino]</b> He’s a footballer, from his head to his toes! He enjoys playing football and he’s not bothered about hard work which is another important thing. Because Millie <b>[James Milner]</b> didn’t play the last game <b>[against Stoke]</b> from the start, Roberto had the highest distance covered. For an offensive player that is pretty rare in world football! I often think that because he doesn’t give himself a rest I have to do it from time to time. That’s all good and how football should be. You play it because you have the opportunity to make your mates better and they help you to become the best player you can be. It’s as simple as that. I am happy to have Roberto around - he’s just a good boy in the dressing room. It’s perfect news</p>

  <p><b>[Why Klopp believes Liverpool are ready to make the next step and bring silverware to Anfield]</b> I think I would take the game again! We played a really good game actually. I remember we were not that experienced in Champions League terms at that time and, well, winning 4-1 against Real Madrid in the first leg is a pretty good result! It was not expected for us. They told us immediately it will be completely different in Madrid with the atmosphere and all those things. But we pretty much killed the atmosphere at the beginning of the game. We had chances from one yard out; Ilkay Gundogan, Robert Lewandowski should have scored, which would’ve had quite an influence on the game. And then about 15-20 minutes before the end, Real scored the first one and it got quite exciting! Yes, I would take the result if I wanted to have the same trip again but I don’t think anyone wants that! We go there actually to try and win the game, not to only lose 2-0..<br /><br /><b>[He is referring back to another European semi, this time with Liverpool in the 2016 Europa League]</b> We conceded a late goal to Villarreal <b>[in the first leg]</b> and it didn’t feel great in that moment to be honest. And then you saw them celebrating and I felt immediately, ‘What are you celebrating? You still have to come to Anfield!<br /><br />In the first moments after the game last week, it was like Roma felt better than we did and that’s crazy. It was 5-2 but everyone was like, ‘Oh, now we have to work again!’ But we knew that already. Look, I cannot tell the boys old fairytales, like ‘You have a manager that came through against Madrid so it is fine’ or whatever. That does not help. We have made our own experiences in the competition and the boys did brilliantly, especially away<br /><br />Everybody talks about the Anfield nights. Yes, outstanding. But the away performances? We have been spot on <b>[in terms of attitude]</b> all of the time. But these are things we have to prove again and again and again. Against Seville we were not mentally weak or whatever; that’s football - it can happen. It’s not that we gave up and it was clear they would score these goals. It was a different game and an interesting game for us. I knew before that Seville is one of the most difficult places to go. I’ve never been to Rome so I cannot say too much about that but I’m sure it will be difficult as well. Of course, the boys are growing in these situations - that’s what you need as a player. You use experience. You don’t take something out of the toolbox and say, ‘That’s the Champions League tool,’ or whatever. But we are more convinced about ourselves than we were before the season, that’s 100 per cent. That’s why we are here.<br /><br />Now they are here, though, the aim is to go further. The final in Kiev beckons, the chance to put European Cup No.6 in the cabinet. Pressure, Jurgen? I don’t think that people are interested in semi-final losers. The same with final losers - I could write a book about that! But the only way to win something is to go the whole way. In football, as in life, if you are not ready to lose you cannot win. If this team goes to the final it would be an outstanding - outstanding - achievement already. It is not the prize we want, because if you go to a final then of course you have to think a little bit bigger, but it would be something we could not have expected at the start of the season. We were not even qualified for the Champions League, we had to play a qualifier, and I don’t know who else reached the semis having been a qualifier at the start? The boys really stepped up<br /><br />From the first minute I came in you are confronted straight away by it. Did you ever hear a player who just signed a new contract not say, ‘I want to win silverware’? They always say that because they have to say that! You cannot come to Liverpool and say, ‘Well, it’s quite a comfortable situation so I’ll have a few nice years of my career here’. We are Liverpool, so somebody kicks our ass constantly. It is, ‘Make the next step, make the next step, make the next step’. It is not possible in this club to stand still. We need to deliver and the good news is we have now a real group of players. I really think it is difficult to improve it a lot. I know which players you immediately think about when you talk about how we could be better because it is always the same, but find me better ones who you know will react in certain situations. The guys on the other side of the fence always look a little bit nicer but we can be stronger. This team can still develop and we will bring in a few fresh legs as well because we need them if we are to be on a high level constantly. A lot of things are really good but players know their responsibility is to be successful. In the end, there will be a team at Liverpool at one point that wins silverware, and we all hope that we are involved in that</p>

We want world-class talent to see they have a home at Anfield where they can fulfil all their professional dreams and ambitions - we are working hard together to achieve this.

Equally, our commitment to him says we see his value and want him to grow even more and get even better within our environment.<br /><br />The key thing to remember is the best thing about Mo is that he never sees himself as being more important than the team or anyone else within it. He recognises his team-mates and this club helped him achieve individual success last season. He sees the individual awards come because he is part of something bigger that is special. Mo reflects where we are as a team, I think. Last season was special with many special moments - but we want more.

When you feel this, you are free for creativity and that is how football works.<br /><br /><b>[When Manchester United were about to pay a world-record fee for Paul Pogba]</b> Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. But if you bring one player in for £100m or whatever, and he gets injured, then it all goes up the chimney. Do I have to do it differently to that? Actually, I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money. The day that this is football, I’m not in a job anymore</p>

They were quite excited, so we did it.<br /><br /><b>[Klopp dismissed concerns over Alisson’s price]</b> I think it’s something we have to do.

I like Christian, I’ve known him since he was a kid. He’s still not really old, he’s a fantastic player, and it’s deserved people think highly of him in America. In Germany it’s the same. If he wants to play in England or whatever one day then for sure he has the chance to do so but he’s at a really good club for his development at this moment. It’s really good to be at a club where they know him already.<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic has made a name for himself in both Germany and the USA]</b> He had not his best season last year but he was still a decisive player. But it’s important in that age group that there’s no rush. He still has 14 or 15 years to play in his career and that’s good and he wants to be the best Pulisic he can be. For this, there is still space for development. If - at one point - he will join us, I don’t know. I like him, it’s not that that could be the problem, but we respect contracts still and there’s no market I know about at the moment. We did our business and Dortmund are doing theirs. All good</p>

We need to be ready for that. I cannot give guarantees here but I understand if people think that. I know about the expectations and that is completely normal. First of all we have to play the football that gives us an opportunity to win something. I am confident we can build on last season. It’s not that we lost things completely but you have to work on it to get it back. I am not in doubt about our basis or that we will reach it again. I want to have the best start ever but we all know that something can happen and then everything is questioned in a second. I am in for the start of a third season and in each season there was one period when people questioned me or our progress. In the end it was OK. I am prepared for these moments. The new players will make us stronger 100%. How? By starting, coming from the bench, the depth of the squad<br /><br />It is not just that we have to be more consistent, we have to create circumstances where we can be more consistent. Nobody is consistent with 11 players. What we are working on is the depth of the squad because you need it. The first part of the season when we did the rotation and we were quite active with it, we did six or seven changes from one game or the other, we still had quality on the pitch that felt perfect. We need to make sure we can do that much longer over the season and that is only possible if you have the squad. That’s the situation. Create the circumstances that we can be more consistent and to improve individually and as a group. Other teams, of course, will do transfer business as well. They will not be weaker than last year. City brought in Riyad Mahrez. I did not hear that they lost one player so far. So it means the quality of last year plus Mahrez. That’s a nice plan as</p>

Yes our job is to improve the team every year, to improve the football every year and if you do that then the chances become bigger. But the thing is that the other teams don’t sleep, so Man City are still a fantastic team and United will have again a fantastic team… Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham. Tottenham pretty much complete, Arsenal, they lost <b>[Jack]</b> Wilshere, that’s it, and otherwise they only brought players in, so strong side obviously. Everton … big things, Wolverhampton can be a surprise. It’s a difficult league, so we don’t have to dream too much and we don’t.<br /><br />The circumstances are good and we have a good team. The people are happy about the team and the players we brought in obviously have quality as well. That’s all good, but that alone is nothing. We have to use the potential and make quality of it.

That’s part of the job, to try to bring the best players you can get. The goalkeeper market is different because it’s not each year that there is anybody available and stuff like that. We didn’t know exactly if Alisson is available or not, but from a specific moment we realized obviously he is available and that’s the moment when we decided we want to go for him. We are really fine with our goalkeepers. So there’s no doubts Simon Mignolet – big quality, absolutely Premier League highest-level quality, Loris Karius as well. Yes, we all know what happened in the <b>[Champions League]</b> final, but we know as well why it’s not about that. It’s not the reason.

It’s not often you get the opportunity to play in the second biggest stadium in the world. It’s an impressive building, it’s cool.<br /><br />It’s pre-season, but it’s United against Liverpool, Liverpool against United so it’s a big game. People in America obviously were waiting for that game, or at least 100,000 people were! We’re really looking forward to it<br /><br />It’s not easy to reach that point, eh? But what can I say about that? Jose can say what he wants to say, to be honest, and obviously I can do the same. But I’m not too much interested in Manchester United. I’m pretty sure they will do business as well in the next few days, but we know about our responsibility. We feel responsible only for our fans, for our owners, for the supporters all over the world, nobody else. That’s the situation. We are ambitious, we never said anything different. We have to deliver; what that means exactly, I don’t know in this moment. We will see that. But a big part of the job is to play football that our people like. That happened last year, probably the year before as well, and now we are in the situation where we want to make the next step. But the opponents don’t sleep. We know that. It means our life is not easier because we brought a few players in. We only feel a bit better prepared than last year. That’s all<br /><br /><b>[Nathaniel Clyne flew home on Thursday for the birth of his son]</b> There are more important things than football, and babies are more important<br /><br /><b>[Klopp chose to throw the name of Rafa Camacho]</b> Having a lot of good full-backs is a perfect situation for the manager. They will all probably play from time to time, and if someone is in very good shape they will play more often<br /><br /><b>[On the Premier League transfer window]</b> I think the idea in general was good, and then we did it and nobody else pretty much did it!. Then we did it in the year the World Cup is in, so it means the boys coming back three days before the transfer window is closing. That is not perfect. It ends earlier and I like it. We did our business pretty early, or at least parts of it. It’s not perfect, but in the next few years I think other countries will adapt or we will adapt again. It’s strange; in other countries the clubs are waiting a little bit, but in England the clubs cannot wait because in 12 days or 13 days it’s closed!<br /><br />If you bring together 100,000 people to watch a football game that says a lot. And I don’t think they all flew in from Europe! They are mostly from America and that’s a good sign. I’ve loved this game since I was three years old. Yesterday for the first time in my life I watched a baseball game. I was in Boston at a sold-out stadium. It’s a different sport and people love it. The country is big enough for soccer to be big as well. So far the atmospheres here have been really good. Wherever we go, our supporters are already there. Last year we flew to Sydney for 15 hours to play a game and then went home. This club is so big that wherever we went in the world we would find Liverpool supporters!</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has broken his silence on Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos following the incident which saw Mohamed Salah suffer a dislocated shoulder during the Champions League final]</b> If you watch it back and you are not with Real Madrid then you think it is ruthless and brutal. I saw the ref taking charge of big games at the World Cup and nobody really thinks about that later. But in a situation like that somebody needs to judge it better. If VAR is coming then it is a situation where you have to look again. Not to give a red card but to look again and say: ‘What is that?’ It was ruthless. I’m not sure it is an experience we will have again - go there and put an elbow to the goalkeeper, put their goalscorer down like a wrestler in midfield and then you win the game. That was the story of the game.<br /><br />Ramos said a lot of things afterwards that I didn’t like. As a person I didn’t like the reactions of him. He was like: ‘Whatever, what do they want? It’s normal.’ No, it is not normal If you put all of the situations of Ramos together then you will see a lot of situations with Ramos. The year before against Juve he was responsible for the red card for <b>[Juan]</b> Cuadrado. Nobody talks about that afterwards. It is like we, the world out there, accepts that you use each weapon to win the game. People probably expect that I am the same. I am not.<br /><br />We are aggressive but I always use the word ‘legal’ as well. Usually if you try something you will get punished. Someone will see it and ban you for four or five weeks. But in this example, no one. This ref should have had the courage to decide that game. In this situation we didn’t get it and, if you write this, people will say I am weak or a bad loser or a whiner. I am not. I accept it. It’s not like I wake up in the morning and think: ‘Ramos!’</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp on why Liverpool are ready to step up]</b> You saw the video, yeah? Well, everybody obviously had a little bit too much alcohol, and when that happens then you should put all smartphones away! That’s the best advice. But I can say this; with all I have, I want to win. I hate losing. I have had to learn to accept it but I still hate it! But after the final whistle, I don’t waste my life suffering. I don’t take the defeat around with me, I go somewhere for a few moments and then I’m done. It cannot help to carry it around. You have to put it away, you can’t go through the game again and say ‘but this and that’. The things from the game are obvious and I can talk about them, but I don’t feel them. That’s how it is.<br /><br /><b>[That run started in 2013 with another Champions League final, a defeat for his Borussia Dortmund side at Wembley against Bayern Munich]</b> It’s different, you’re right. We lost Mario Gotze after that 2013 final - in fact we lost him two weeks before that! It was not ‘over’ for Dortmund after that final, we were still a good team who could finish second and get to the cup final and things like that, but it was not exactly the same, yes. Somebody came and thought ‘they’re too good, let’s try to avoid the next step!’. With Liverpool, we never felt Kiev was the last step. We are in the middle of our development. We are not unbeatable, we are not the best team in the world but we have a specific style of play which makes us a really good side. I was really happy, for example, with how we played for half an hour in the final. I think before the game everyone felt ‘Real Madrid is the better team so they will win’ but after half an hour a lot of people who don’t watch us that often will have thought ‘game on!’. I was happy with that, but we didn’t win so that’s that. We start again, we are silver-medallists in the Champions League, if you like, but we need to start over. We will get a really tough group, for sure, but we have to be ready. I think we will be<br /><br />I was not in doubt about my team before the game and I was not in doubt afterwards either. It was only that we had that chance and it had gone. Do you get it again? I waited five years and had to move clubs to get another chance, but that’s life. A lot of my colleagues tried their whole lives and never got there. I went there twice, which is big, but with not winning it can only be an experience. It’s an interesting experience, but it’s not what it could be. You can win a final with a really bad team if you’re lucky. Nobody wants to play the best football in the final, only to win it. For us, that didn’t happen<br /><br />We need to be a little bit more lucky in decisive moments. For example, if you saw the final; Madrid played with their strongest line-up, with every player included. Okay, Carvajal got injured but they had Marcelo, bam, centre-halves, bam, midfield, attack, everyone. We had a strong team too, but we played with the same team for what, the last 12 games? And that’s not an advantage! If you want to be successful in these competitions - Premier League, Champions League - then you need to have a wider squad. That’s what we are trying to do. The squad last season was wide enough, actually, but in one week we lost three players and it’s like ‘wow!’ The midfield was like … .gone, and it’s a very intense position. You see the players and they run left and right and you’re thinking … ..<br /><br />Then we had Chelsea chasing us until the last game. They were 2-0 down against Southampton, and if they lost that game then our season is over and we can prepare for the final. But they win it, and so we have to go ahead until the very last matchday. It was really tough. But that’s the job. Nobody moaned. You cannot blame anybody, and we don’t try to. What we do instead is try to make the squad wider with similar quality and then try to make the next step together. Hopefully everybody can see that<br /><br /><b>[Which begs the question; what makes it work so well, and who deserves the credit?]</b> The big thing is to be always working together. How can I go around and say it’s about this or that? We talk about positions, and then we bring in the names from left and right. Then we think ‘oh yes, sounds good, make a video’. Then we make a video and it looks even better! That’s how it works. It’s not one genius decision where someone says ‘oh, I think if we can get him then … ‘ stuff like that. They are obvious things. Salah we worked all together, with Sadio we worked all together, now with Shaqiri we worked all together. That’s how it is; one brings it up, then someone else makes the next step. But at the end, I have to make a decision; does it fit or not? If I think it fits then we do it. That’s what we have done the last few years, that’s what we did with Virgil in January, now with Alisson it’s the same. I’ll use an example; Robbo <b>[Andrew Robertson]</b>. Robbo we had a long think about. There were not 20 clubs who wanted Robbo. A left-back getting relegated and then coming here? It was clear that he needed time, but he took the time, he used the time and now, if I was to sell him I would have more than 20 clubs wanting him. People would pay much more than we did now! The whole team gives players opportunity to settle quick and to use their quality to make the next step in their own careers. That’s really cool and hopefully we can continue like this</p>

But it’s getting more and more difficult for young boys at a club like Liverpool, to be honest. On one side we are buying players for 50 or 60 million, and on the other we are getting players for free from the youth team. But they need time and opportunity to play. They play in the U-23s, which is fine, but then they don’t like it that much. They train the whole week with the first team and then they go to play with the U-23s and the dressing room is as big as this table and there are no supporters! It’s not the same.

In the moment it is OK, but in the future it will be too small, so we will build and we go together. It will be the football headquarter of Merseyside. The ones who go through that Academy, at all steps, must be brilliant footballers. That’s the goal. I’m really looking forward to it. It’s good for the Academy as well. If you go to U-18 games there, you know what the wind is like, yeah? When we go there we will sort it, we will build things around it that can help the young players.

The media thing, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, you lose a game and have to give 17 interviews, and yeah it’s not what you want to do. But you don’t want to do it if you win the game! Mind you.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has aimed a fresh dig at Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos]</b> I don’t want to win by any means. Of course I would have liked to become a Champions League winner, and I would not have returned the title if shown various indiscretions. I do not expect that from him <b>[Ramos]</b>, I only expect that he gives more thought to his assessment of certain situations. It may have been a coincidence, but Mo Salah was taken out of the game during an outstanding phase of his footballing life, in the middle of the field. Many people will say that these things happen. But if that is the message we are sending to our children, that nothing is out of bounds and it’s all about winning, then I will be glad to leave this planet in 40 years. Am I a good loser? No. But during our preparations we had to talk about Ramos because he had influenced the final the previous year with a dive and a red card <b>[for Juan Cuadrado]</b> against Juventus. Real Madrid have deserved to win the Champions League, nobody has ever said anything else. But do you have to have those situations with Ramos? No, you don’t.</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp pieced together Liverpool’s £177m spending spree before Champions League final]</b> The Champions League final had absolutely nothing to do with our transfer business. Everything was already fixed and clear what we wanted. All decisions were made to that point already. I think our areas were obvious. If Alisson was not on the market, we don’t move for a goalkeeper. He was on the market so we went for it. That we wanted to have more options offensively - that was clear long before the final. I think Shaqiri is a fantastic example of how you can do it. He ticks different boxes, he can play wide, he can play No. 10, it looks like he can play eight too and that is cool. As for Fabinho, we knew a bit longer that Emre <b>[Can]</b> would not extend his contract so Fabinho was clear as a target, but not clear that we would get him. Naby was clear. One left, one came in. Phil <b>[Coutinho]</b> left before then Naby came in. It is not the same type of player but it is a similar position at least.</p>

I am not a genius. I knew about the potential of the club and the stadium because everyone knows about it. Of course it is different <b>[now]</b> but the team is different and we win step by step. If I would have said three years ago we would have a better atmosphere in the stadium and win more home games then that is nothing. People would expect that. We want to win things but we don’t know when that will happen. We don’t have a clue, so we should have the best time of our lives until it happens. Performance-wise, result-wise, atmosphere-wise, have the best time until it happens. When it happens we have to start again. If it doesn’t happen we have to try again. That is how life is and football is.<br /><br />I don’t expect a better atmosphere because what I like is our crowd really responds to the game. Not in a bad way if we don’t perform they don’t moan or whistle. But if we deliver passion, they are over the moon. Against Southampton we controlled the game so I am completely fine. But now Chelsea is coming in a very good moment. I don’t understand why people constantly say it is about City and Liverpool <b>[for the title]</b> and forget that Chelsea are winning games in a quite impressive way. Then again Chelsea on Saturday. It is fine but nothing else</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Fabinho to be given time to settle by Klopp]</b> It’s not different between him and other players. It’s really not complicated, he just needs to get used to it. It’s about positioning; it’s about reaction, about spaces defensively, closing them, offensively using them. It’s a football team with a specific way of playing. It needs time, and they were all used to other football teams. So, you have natural runs in a team. Like, let me say, a very famous movement here was Phil Coutinho. Half left, inside, nice shot! For this one, you needed somebody to overlap and make it difficult to defend, so that one defender at least is busy. Things like that explain it. It’s completely normal. There’s no time to say ‘I give you that, or that’, but it will happen. Because the game is so quick and intense, it needs to get natural. It’s not about changing these players, we want their football personality. They are here because of what they did. Three or five weeks sound like a long time in football, but to improve something you can give half a year, to really make the next step. That’s it<br /><br />Football players are used to that. Playing a game at 50 per cent would be a waste of time. I don’t put pressure on each player who plays tomorrow. If I make changes, I see it as an opportunity, if not then it’s an opportunity anyway. The boys have to prove themselves constantly, to show they are ready for all competitions and each game. That’s pleased me the most, the impact of the boys who came in. Joel was brilliant, really brilliant. <b>[Xherdan]</b> Shaqiri, of course, all the guys who came on were really good. I want to see a really good football game tomorrow, and I want us to win that game. The pressure is already there. If you don’t perform then it’s quite difficult to improve your situation. But the situation of nobody in this team is bad at the moment. Maybe they are not in the squad, but that doesn’t mean they train bad. I couldn’t name one player in the moment who is not training on their highest level. That’s the best thing to say. And as long as that’s the case, then it’s a good situation. They are all in, nobody is out<br /><br />We lost important players during the summer, so we had to replace them and we did. We had always quite a good squad when we had no injuries, then we had injuries and the squad didn’t look that good anymore! In the moment we are in a good way. If they all can carry on training like they do, pushing each other, then we are ready for more than one competition. There are only two competitions per week. Always the Premier League, then you have to play one of the other ones. It depends on us how long we will play them</p>

  <p><b>[Why Klopp and Liverpool cannot underestimate the League Cup this season]</b> We never say it is ‘only the League Cup’. When I first came in, my first cup game was Bournemouth and everybody here told me you play ‘the kids’. I thought: ‘What? You have a competitive game and you play the kids?!’ If I see one player tomorrow go into the game and give me the feeling that he thinks: ‘It’s only the League Cup,’ then he could have a real problem. But I know that there will be no player.<br /><br />We make the decisions because of the situation, not the competition. It’s a competition we like! The final is at Wembley. That means something. I remember when we were there, we wanted to win it. We were close, but we didn’t. We will try it again<br /><br />It’s not about judging which silverware is more important. You cannot do it like that. What we have to do is to always be at 100 per cent; concentration, rhythm, focus, intensity. Always be there, and don’t think about where it leads to. Tomorrow night is a football game, at a sold-out Anfield. We will be there with all we have. Then if, if, we go to the next round, then we will play that game again with all we have. That’s the only way I know, unfortunately!</p>

We actually have two. It’s always two in a week. There are not three competitions in one week. We have to play Premier League always and then one of the other competitions, it depends on us how long we will play in them. From this perspective, at the moment, I would say we can give our all in two competitions as long as possible. But how long is it possible? I don’t know</p>

He lost balls in those situations last year. How do you deal with it? Be relaxed, completely relaxed, because there is no need for anything else. Completely relaxed. The quality is there and so everything is fine<br /><br />There are not big talks necessary, just a completely normal situation. Even Ian Rush didn’t score 40 goals in 10 seasons, season after season. That’s not how it works. You have to be a proper threat. As an offensive player you have to work hard. At the end of season it depends how much success we have as a team if it is successful or not. There is no personal success possible. All awards are for everyone. We do what we do best. So in these situations going through them there is no advice, you can not give it, because the experience they make themselves.

We want the focus to be on a great game of football, free from anything else. We are keen to be respectful and keen to avoid any distractions that would take focus away from a 90-minute-plus contest that is important for football and only football. So for that reason, Shaq is not involved and he accepts and understands this. Shaq is our player, we love him, and he will play for us a lot of times, but not on Tuesday.<br /><br />I have heard so many wonderful things about the city of Belgrade, and the country of Serbia as a whole, from friends and colleagues who’ve visited before, so now I’m really looking forward to taking Liverpool there for a great game of Champions League football.<br /><br />We will take pretty much everyone. Clyney is ill and will not be involved, but Dejan and Naby are back in the travelling squad. Hendo was close, but not close enough. He needs two proper sessions for his fitness, which he will get at Melwood, with Shaqiri and hopefully Clyney if he is back from illness. They both should be fine for the weekend.</p>

  <p><b>[Why Xherdan Shaqiri was left out Liverpool’s squad for Red Star Belgrade]</b> It’s a situation where we will go to the fantastic city of Belgrade as a football team to play football. We have heard and read the speculation and talk about what kind of reception Shaq would receive and although we have no idea what would happen, we want to go there and be focused 100 per cent on football and not have to think about anything else, that’s all. We are Liverpool FC, a big club, a football team but we don’t have any message further than that. We have no political message, absolutely not. We want the focus to be on a great game of football, free from anything else. We are keen to be respectful and keen to avoid any distractions that would take focus away from a 90-minute-plus contest that is important for football and only football. So for that reason, Shaq is not involved and he accepts and understands this. Shaq is our player, we love him, and he will play for us a lot of times, but not on Tuesday.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists he is not concerned by Roberto Firmino’s form]</b> No. He’s hard-working, sometimes better, sometimes a bit less, but good. That’s how it is. It will be all fine for sure. If he didn’t score in the last few games then … one in nine? All competitions? Didn’t he score against Red Star? That was the one goal he scored? Okay, good. I am not concerned. Things like this happen. He is a very important player for us. I was not really happy with our defending first half in London and he was involved in that. That’s what I’m talking about. In the end everything will be fine. We know about these situations. Sometimes it is clicking easier than in other moments, that’s all. There are no concerns.<br /><br /><b>[When pushed on whether the striker is in need of a rest in Belgrade on Tuesday]</b> Not really but, of course, it is something we think about 100%. Constantly, actually. It often leads to the decision that he still has to play. He starts or comes on, sometimes it is better to come in the game later when all the rest are a bit tired but we will see how we handle</p>

To be clear: the performance against Red Star wasn’t at the levels we expect of ourselves. End of story. But I also cannot and will not ignore everything else we have done so far this season. We kick off this fixture today, our 12th Premier League game of the season, with 27 points and within striking distance of first place in the table. These points have not been given to us on a silver plate or gift-wrapped. Our destiny in the Champions League group remains in our own hands. Not only are we in a situation with a number of avenues to qualify but if we win both our remaining games we will finish top of a highly competitive mini-league</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp concedes that Liverpool got a bit lucky in a meeting with Fulham]</b> I have seen it once, I’m not sure. What did the guys who have seen it 20 times say? It’s still difficult to tell? I don’t want to compare it, but against Arsenal we scored a clearer goal which was not offside and didn’t get it. You cannot change it. The most important thing is reacting in that situation that quickly, that was brilliant. In the end, we were a bit lucky. It’s like it is. We cannot change it. Fulham cannot change it. The reaction was brilliant.<br /><br />In a few moments it was tough, and in a few moments it was not that tough. When we saw their line-up we were a bit surprised - how could we prepare for that line-up? It was the first this season, I think, that Fulham have played like this, with the players they lined up today with four or five centre-halves. So far, Fulham have always had a football-playing idea. Today, they were winning second balls, had everyone on their toes, and while they played a bit of football there was a lot of long build-up, and Mitrovic did outstandingly well in those situations. That was a bit tricky, but apart from that, the boys from the beginning did really well. We created, we passed, we accelerated in the right moments. We had big chances early with Sadio <b>[Mane]</b>, with Shaq, with Mo in the box, when they were blocking in the last second and the goalie could make a save. I don’t know exactly how many chances we had today, but it wasn’t important as we scored twice. Maybe it was a bit strange how we scored, one after a quick restart and one in the second ball phase at a set-piece. But it’s important you have these situations in your locker and you can use them. I’m completely happy, apart from scoring more goals. It was a really good performance. We had to work hard, we won it. All good</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has dismissed suggestions of a permanent formation change for his side]</b> We played it from time to time, we didn’t only play it at the beginning when I came in. We played it last year, I think we played it in the last game. We played different systems. But I don’t think too much about things like that, I’m always in the situation. I use my experience with only what I can remember - I don’t go through my papers and think: ‘What did we do in that situation?’. I’m pretty sure we played a diamond because I played it always when I had the opportunity to do it, bringing in two strikers and stuff like that<br /><br />Our system, when we play with all three up front, is something like a diamond; it can be a 4-5-1, it can be a 4-3-3. Of course, 4-2-3-1 - 4-4-1-1 I’d prefer in most situations to name it - is a good system. But it’s never about the system, it’s all about the players. My job is to bring the players into the best position where they can help the team most with the things they can do. If I can do it with the system, I do it, but it’s not that we go through the week and be very creative with things like that because, in the end, the players need to play <b>[on instinct]</b>. If I need an hour or two to explain what I want from them, maybe I have got them <b>[in the mind]</b> but I don’t get them deeper. That’s the problem. Don’t make football more complicated than it is; the game has enough demands for the players that we don’t need a manager who asks more questions</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp never had any doubt that Sadio Mane was an outstanding player]</b> He is an outstanding player, I never had any other opinion. Since he came in he helped the team so much, he improved so much. He is an outstanding offensive player. If you ask me if he is a striker, yes, from time to time; is he a midfielder, yes, from time to time; he can probably play a slightly deeper position as well - we don’t have to play him there because we have other players there but he could play it as well. He is physically strong, technically strong, he is unbelievably quick, he is quick in mind as well, and he is a good shooter with both feet. That makes a good player and he is a fantastic person. He needed more confidence when he came in, the start was really good but I think he was a bit surprised by himself. Everything was good until the first time his shape dropped a little bit and then he struggled a bit with that, because he needed to get used to that he is a world-class player. Now, he knows that much better. That helps us. He is a really good player.</p>

So many things are better than last year: defending is better, set-pieces are better; we are much more mature in games, game management is better. So many things are better. Last year at the same time, we didn’t have 20 good games - we lost at Tottenham in October. In the Champions League, we were flying, that’s true.<br /><br />Belgrade, by the way, there is no excuse for that - it was just a really bad game. And Napoli was not a really good game as well. So there were two days we were really not good, that’s true. All the other games were really good. We played against PSG; they have lost one game in the whole season in all competitions and that was against us. It’s all good, I like the season.

I can’t think of a single club anywhere in Europe that wouldn’t want a player like Sadio available to them, so the fact he wants to remain with us says something about where we are currently. He is a such an important member of our team and squad. He radiates joy and I think this is reflected in his performances and impact on the pitch. The only criticism I could ever have of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to see just how good he is - but as an attacking player he is the complete package. He made a big impact when he first arrived, but if anything he’s got better and better each season. His trajectory has only been upwards in terms of his level and his contribution</p>

He used the time to adjust to what we want, which was really good in the last games he played. Of course he will not leave. I don’t talk about transfers but if anybody asks then nobody leaves here. That would be completely crazy. He doesn’t want to, it’s just the crazy world out there where if a player doesn’t play in the last five games, you open kind of a transfer market.

At the end of his career, Dom Solanke will not really know about these two or three years. He’s only in the situation he is in because he is so good. That is why people already think about why he doesn’t play. He started early with games at Chelsea.

We fixed that, kind of, and it always happens that the first step is it costs you a bit of fluency and creativity. That is a completely normal thing. If someone would think about it for one second they would see it is clear, it is logical. Now, when we fix that, I can’t say in the first moment to the boys: ‘But that’s not enough offensively’.

There were a few games last season, when we were really flying and the opponent collapsed like Watford here, then we had the big games like Roma and Man City, where were these games in the league? But I get constantly confronted with the question - something is missing. What’s that? Of course it could be better but it is not because of one player. We are creative. I don’t know how many goals we’ve scored but we’ve had many more chances. Creating is not a problem. You could say finishing the problem, whatever you want. In the end, in the games we won we were always the better side. That’s pretty rare. Not one lucky game when it was ‘wow, how did that happen?’ I get that you have to write about things, no problem, but write it and don’t ask me about it because I’m not interested about it, I don’t think about it and I can’t answer it.

  <p><b>[Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had no hesitation selecting James Milner at right-back for his 500th Premier League appearance]</b> It’s no problem. I thought it could be a problem, but obviously he would have even played goalkeeper in game number 500! We need to be flexible, all of us, in the period - different positions, different jobs to do in the games. But it’s only slightly different and Millie knows it from his time at left-back. We are a very offensive-orientated team, which means he is very often in a comfortable area. With his experience, and especially against Bournemouth with the counter-attack, you need all the defensive skills as well. Fraser, Brooks, Stanislas or whoever are all nice and speedy, King as well. It’s a job to do, but it’s nice to be part of the 500th Premier League game of Millie.<br /><br /><b>[Andy Robertson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum are also recalled]</b> I don’t think any of the boys have to show they are ready for a test or whatever. It was clear when we built the squad for the season that we wanted to have opportunities like that. It’s never easy because for football, rhythm is a very important thing and if you have no rhythm, like you saw in the first half against Burnley, it makes life a bit uncomfortable, but that’s normal. Having that game was very, very important and then the second half showed everything is fine. Now we have to do the same again because it’s only three days since Burnley, and we play our next game in three days. We don’t think about Napoli in the moment, but we cannot ignore it from an intensity point of view</p>

They <b>[Napoli]</b> should have to work very hard for any chance and then we still have the opportunity to save it. And on the other side, we have to score. The only thing that is clear is if we go 1-0 up then it is not like it would usually be at 1-0. If they score we then have to score a second and a third and that is a very hard job to do. We knew that already. Now we have to do the job.<br /><br />We were all not 500 times in a situation where 1-0 is good but 2-1 is not, 3-1 is good again but 3-2 is not.

Then you come closer and closer as a group. But if we have a training session and the boys are not spot on, I’m probably the loudest person in the world. It’s a waste of time. As long as we don’t waste time, we have no problem with a good atmosphere around the sessions, I have no problem with the good atmosphere in the sessions. But I expect 100 percent concentration because we train an hour and a half or whatever a day.

  <p><b>[Klopp has dismissed suggestions that his side remain in strong contention to lift their first league title since 1990]</b> That means nothing. We play Arsenal and City. Good that we have six points more than other teams but that is pretty much what we wanted to do all the time, create a basis for the rest of the season. Now the first part of the season is over. We want to create our own history so the first time in the Premier League unbeaten, we conceded seven goals, that is good. Numbers good, good situation, but 19 games to go.</p>

It’s absolutely not important how much points you are ahead in December, even in the end of December. What you all create and I get that, how can you not be positive about us? But you are the first if we drop three points and the next headline is: ‘Are they nervous now?’. That’s <b>[an]</b> easy job. I would love to be in your situation, still earn the money I earn, but be in your situation. We cannot play that game and we don’t do it.<br /><br />Before the game we heard because it was on all the screens about the result of Tottenham. Did you think the party started already? I didn’t see a smile in any faces in the dressing room. Just see it and then go on. We came here in that situation with 54 points after 20 matchdays now completely being focused on the situation. Now it’s not about creating headlines, creating stories. It’s still about preparing football matches, play them as good as you can and try to get as many points as you can. That’s it</p>

There are a couple of clubs interested, but to be honest if these clubs don’t give me the guarantee that he will play, there is absolutely no reason from my point of view to give him on loan.<br /><br />When we give players on loan, we don’t want to make them ready for life outside because that’s what we can do as well. We want to give them the opportunity to play football and for playing football you need to fight for your place, but that’s what they learn here as well. You don’t need to give them on loan so they learn this.<br /><br />Football is, in parts, a ‘dirty business’ and people really forget immediately - if you have two or three games and are not that convincing, people think ‘oh, he lost it’ or whatever. Ben Woodburn is an outstanding talent, still pretty much a kid, and I am happy to see him here, running around, completely fit and really settled in the squad. He was that before.<br /><br />In the summer, I think he lost a bit of patience and it was really long he was already with us. The first-team situation didn’t really change and then you maybe - and it’s normal and can happen - lose patience. Then you have a rather average experience at another club and you come back and see here everything is still like it was before.<br /><br />Now he trained for the first time so I think if something happens with a loan, then it will happen at the end of the week. We will really try to give him as many sessions as possible so if he goes somewhere, he is really in a good situation</p>

Everything is fine but people understandably become a bit nervous in situations like that. That is normal. My experience at <b>[Borussia]</b> Dortmund was no different there.

You cannot do it like that. I don’t think about losing the game, but if we do then we are still level on points with Man City That is the worst thing that can happen. Yes, we have to be 100 per cent ready to have a chance there. But If we are 100 per cent ready then we have a chance there - we are strong enough that they have to respect us as well</p>

All the injuries in the game obviously cost us rhythm. It happened to us with Bobby <b>[Firmino]</b> and that was a catastrophe<br /><br />United played with a completely new midfield and three up front. We lost our rhythm and couldn’t get it back. It was a game without a lot of highlights - it was intense. On days when United are beatable you have to do it and we didn’t do it<br /><br />We have a point more and Wednesday is our next game. We might feel like we won a point or lost two. We started exactly how we wanted to start. We were without chances - only United had one big one when Alisson made an excellent save - the rest were set-pieces. It kept the game open but we didn’t create enough and that’s the truth. We didn’t do well to be honest. We take that. It is a point gained because we have one more than before but it doesn’t feel like that</p>

I am not here to be disappointed, I am here to help the players to play their best football<br /><br />Mo said this week in an interview ‘there is pressure’ and of course there is pressure. Actually, from my point of view it is a very positive pressure, but I don’t have to play. I only sit here and say dumb things, so that’s easy. We all have to learn in these situations, the only way we can do it is with passion. This club, the heart and soul of this club, is passion. On Wednesday night we have another chance <b>[against Watford]</b> and then there’s the derby <b>[against Everton]</b>, which is always a very emotional game so again passion. We had to fight, but it was a different fight to what we expected and we didn’t adapt exactly like we should have. We know where we are coming from and we know where we are. Now let’s make sure we use the situation as good as possible and then we will see where it ends for us.<br /><br />Today was not brilliant, but we’ve lost here more often than we’ve drawn. Today we drew, we have a point but it feels like we should have won - that was the same against Bayern. It shows where you’re coming from when Bayern plays against you and defends with all they have. Something changed in the world of football, everybody adapted to it and now we have to make sure we adapt as well to our quality. Nothing really serious happened today; we came here, we wanted to win that game with all the talk around and stuff like that about United being in a fantastic moment. They are, that’s true but they still have 14 points less than we have. The good news about today is that didn’t change so let’s carry on. We take that point, it’s one more than a lot of people probably expected. So now everything is equal games-wise, and now let’s play the rest of the season. All good</p>

I was a full-back myself for a decent part of my career, it looked completely different to what the boys are doing but at least I know the things to do; you have to be really strong defensively, but on the other side a lot of teams clear the wings for the full-backs offensively. You have to be able to be open-minded enough and clear enough to see some people in the box with the same shirt! That helps a lot. In that game <b>[the 5-0 win over Watford]</b> it was exceptional.

There’s not a moment where we say, ‘Come on now, throw everything in that direction’. You cannot play in the Premier League like that.

All that we saw so far in training looks really good, it looks really exciting, but we all know it is a massive difference between each training session you have and playing a proper game. It’s not about the opponent, it’s about judging situations, a bigger pitch, higher intensity, a different concentration level. The preparation for a match is different to a normal training session, so players after a long period <b>[out]</b> need to get used to that.<br /><br />There is absolutely no expectation on the game <b>[for him]</b> apart from go through it, tick that box, come back and go on training again. It doesn’t say anything about him ‘being ready for five days later’ or whatever, it is just a first - and very, very important - step. As I said, in training Ox is back but now we have to make sure we really prepare him for the rest of his career and the rest of this season. Probably it will be 45 minutes and that’s absolutely OK. It is a bit difficult for Critch <b>[U-23 manager Neil Critchley]</b> when the manager tells you to make a change at half-time, but it’s nice for Ox.<br /><br />The boys worked really hard and a lot with him in rehab, but you cannot do it like it is a normal football game. The intensity cannot be that high or you kill a player then. He needs matches and as many as possible, but we are in the middle of the season and will not say now, ‘You need six or seven matches until you are ready’. It is about getting him the experience again on the pitch, getting him back in this one and then using him minute-by-minute on the pitch. As long as all the other players are fit and stuff like that, we will have to see who can help the team more when he is finally back. In the moment, he looks brilliant, everything is really, really good. Now let’s play football<br /><br />I am happy people didn’t ask after one session if he could play at the weekend!. He’s had a couple of sessions and now he has a first game and that’s really cool. Let’s see how he reacts, how he feels and all that stuff. But it is not in the plans, there is nothing to think about before the international break, but this game, maybe another game and having a bit longer and then having the international break, which from now is around three weeks I think, so then.

But they like this kind of game. There are only two interesting games in the whole of Europe that night. Let’s play them, let’s watch them. This is the spotlight you want as a professional football player, so let’s play the game. We all have to qualify constantly for Champions League. That’s what gives us the money to improve to do the next step and the next step. When we qualified by beating Napoli <b>[in the group stages]</b> I’m not sure how much but it was <b>[worth]</b> a lot of money in one game. I didn’t think a second about that before that game. It wasn’t like ‘Oh my God! We have to earn this money for the club!’ We only wanted to go through. But after we got through it was like ‘Wow! That’s proper!’ It is a money-throwing competition, if I can say that, and we have to be in it as long as possible because we have to improve the situation for the club.<br /><br />It’s not like we always ask people ‘Do you have some money? Do you have some money?’ We have to earn most of the money for ourselves with the football that we play. That is exactly what you can do in the Champions League. If it happens, it will be a great night. If it doesn’t happen, it is not the end of the world<br /><br />It’s all about the situation in that moment. You have seen how it can change in three weeks. There was a little bit of criticism around - not free-flowing football and second in the league, which for Bayern is a deep crisis. Our image and our strengths play into this: how we can play if a team is not 100 per cent against us? It’s not the first time it has happened to us but it’s a very good sign in general for us as a club that we have that respect again within the game. We have developed a lot and the boys have improved. We are a proper contender in a difficult competition with only fantastic teams left. It was not surprising they played like this. It’s normal, they adapted. Bayern is famous for going for results they think are good for them. Usually they try more to win than they did at Anfield but on the night they thought 0-0 was the perfect result. Now we have to show it is not like this - we have to score if we want to go through; they have to score if they want to go through. This will change the game a little bit but not too much, especially probably at the beginning</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp wary of motivated Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller following Germany axing]</b> The only possibility for me is to think about how I’d react. I was never in contention for the national team but if something like this happened to you when you are young, fit and healthy then I think I would try to show it was a mistake. I know that all three would love to play for Germany, that’s how it is. With all the decisions a manager has to make, it’s always 50/50 - some like them, some don’t like them. The difference between a national coach and a club coach is if I say to a player here that he cannot play anymore then he can look for another club. In this case you cannot look for another country!<br /><br />I don’t know the reasons exactly 100 per cent but what I would say is it is difficult to take the opportunity away for a player to qualify for a national team. I didn’t hear about a lot of similar situations. A centre-half at 30 years is nothing, so age cannot really be a reason. Other reasons, I don’t know. If you are a player and you don’t really retire by yourself there should still be an opportunity to qualify for the national team. That’s my opinion but I am not in the situation. If you tell a player, ‘You stay at home, I don’t invite you - I am not happy with your performances’ or whatever, then that’s the 100 per cent right of the national team. But if it is ‘Whatever you do, it won’t be enough to be in the national team again’ it’s not like it should sound</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp hoping Champions League ‘trend’ continues]</b> That’s it! That’s the new trend! It doesn’t make a massive difference that we didn’t score at home. I like this situation. If we have all the players available and can really go for it, then we are in a good moment and it is a big chance for us. Last season, we were 5-0 up <b>[against Porto]</b>, 3-0 up <b>[Manchester City]</b> and 5-2 up <b>[Roma]</b> from the first legs, but all we can use from that is our experience. Usually the game is not decided after the first game. We have to know that. We are not like kids thinking if we do not win it in the first leg we have no chance. We are still in it, for sure<br /><br />I do not think about that. I can imagine people think like that, but all the games were completely different. The <b>[Red Star]</b> Belgrade game was a bad game from us; the worst game we played in any competition. You could not explain it. So, you cut it off. Playing in Paris is not a nice place to go, especially when they need a result. The third, Napoli, yes they were just good. It was nothing to do with playing away. It was not our best football. That is how we see it. It is not that we are not able to perform in an away atmosphere<br /><br />They talk constantly. It doesn’t <b>[mean they]</b> make more sense because of that. That’s the problem. It is so easy to sit in an office or a studio and talk about things like that. We draw a season and say the best way to go through it is to go out of all the cup competitions early. Then, you do that and in that moment the same people go for you like mad. It’s like: ‘You are disrespectful to the competition’. Now it is closer to the end of the season and it is allowed that we go out of the Champions League without even trying to go through? That’s really mad! That’s the reason why they don’t have a job on the sideline. I mean it. It’s one of the reasons. No criticism but it’s a big difference to be in charge or to talk about somebody in charge. That’s a massive difference. We play proper, real football and we try to win every game. Now it is the next one, it is the only one we play on Wednesday night, so let’s try and win it.<br /><br /><b>[Klopp himself has admitted that the Premier League is the trophy his fans want]</b> It is important to everyone. The only thing I would say is that if we go out, maybe the fans won’t be outstanding or exceptional angry - ‘How can that happen!’ - because we still have a chance with the league. I don’t think they will think before the game ‘I hope we go out’ or something like that.<br /><br />There is no real pressure. I only see it as an opportunity. We cannot think about the league in a moment like this. What can we do? Change all the players, make six, seven changes and try with a kind of ‘B’ team? You have to go into this game with all you have, use the opportunity and try everything you can. Win it or go out. Everyone knows you can go out against Bayern and no-one will say: ‘How could that happen?’ That’s how we see it. Clear. We wanted and we still want to prove our value again in Europe<br /><br /><b>[Victory over Bayern]</b> We have a chance. And that is all we need</p>

The best way to do it is to bring together a group of players, try to develop them all together and then stay together for a while.

We are in this situation long enough to know it is difficult for other teams to beat us, and that gives us always an opportunity to win. In most of the draws we had, we were closer to winning the game, and that gives us confidence to go for it and do the right things. For five or 10 minutes before the equaliser, we had so many mistakes, which made it a wild game. we controlled the game completely, then we gave Fulham the ball and then the crowd came and it was a bit more exciting again.

We probably didn’t have as many chances as we wish in the second half, but controlling happens in different ways. The best way is with the ball. When we lost it, we had to do a lot of work to get it back. That’s not too cool, but we had fantastic counter-press situations, protection was brilliant second half.

We showed we are in good shape, as we have to be because we have really big targets. That’s what we have to show again.

Chelsea are in good shape, Hazard is in very good shape. It’s a big game for us, and not an easy one. But come on, we are in good shape as well. It’s Anfield and I said it a few times, we have to create the Power of Anfield and use it again. I am so happy with our supporters, how they dealt with everything. We really developed together and this is a good moment to show all the improvement we made, and use the positive vibes and energy.

It’s still only a few people doing it, but the stronger the reaction is from all of us, the more it will help to avoid things like this in the future. These guys now are football fans, and if you do something like that, you should not be able to enter a stadium again, in my point of view, in your life.<br /><br />It’s just a complete misunderstanding of how life should be. All kinds of racism are just that some people think they are worth more, more valuable than others. That’s the biggest misunderstanding in the world out there. As a part of the football community, I can say that these people should not be involved. Football is the best example for how different people, different races can work together brilliantly. Go in each dressing room, and you find them all there sitting there together, next to each other and nobody cares about where he’s coming from, who his parents were. It’s never an issue. That’s what I can say. They should not be allowed to be part of the football community again. They did it now, but hopefully we can avoid someone doing something like this again. Football is very public and we have a strong voice, we have to use that strong voice and show that we all think the same. Things like this are not allowed to happen again.</p>

For this season it was already different when we came back because of the negative things we experienced ourselves in the last game of last season.

That has nothing to do with other games and I really hope people don’t come in the stadium and feel that way because we need <b>[the atmosphere]</b> like it was in the Tottenham game. Four years ago we were 2-1 down to West Brom at home and lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace and 15,000 people left the stadium because they thought: ‘OK, I want to beat the traffic’. That is when I said I felt alone. Tottenham was the absolute opposite of that. No one thought: ‘They have bottled it again, it has slipped through their fingers.’ Instead they thought we have to stand up and go for it. That is exactly how it was. I don’t know if it was not like this in the last five or 10 years. But it is like this now and that is great. There will be nervy moments, difficulties in the game, but in this moment we all looked ready for dealing with it and that is why I am happy with that<br /><br />If you take a 400m race the runners are all together.

In England, the top four have a very good age structure. And, of course, there are a few other reasons why there are a lot of good footballers around here in England. English football is good, the national team too, the top six are all very good - but that’s never a guarantee for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp’s priceless response after being asked how <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> can fix Man Utd]</b> They didn’t help us, why should we help them?!<br /><br /><b>[Asked for his thoughts on the Manchester derby]</b> It was the result I expected. United tried whatever they can, in the first half especially. They were a bit unlucky in one or two moments, but over 95 mins it was clear they can’t stand up to City at the moment. I was not surprised by the result. I watched it and I was completely calm. Finally, this game was played, for months there was always one game in hand. Now it’s clear, we are one point behind City and if we win our next two games, then it will be decided on the last game. That’s pretty special. But first we have to win our games, which is difficult enough. We are concentrated on the next one, against Huddersfield<br /><br />It’s like Highlander, only one of us will be there at the end! We don’t only play to be champions, yes it’s a main target, and this team is pretty close in the moment. We still have a chance, and we will see what happens. But this will be the first time, not the last time. Just because the club is waiting a long time but that doesn’t make it any more likely. That we are close is already rather surprising because last year we were 25 points behind. That’s really good. We have to carry on, and we will carry on, but only one team can be champion. I knew that before we started. We want to play the best football we can play every single day. That’s all we are interested in. We still have three games to play, <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>, Newcastle, Wolverhampton - they proved again that it will be a tough game. We don’t have to reset the situation or summarise the season. If we do it, we will do it. If we don’t do it, there are no regrets as long as we give it our best, and I saw that all season from the boys. Whatever we end up, it is only the first step. We are not finished. We started this year with this team and we will carry on.</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s triumph of Barcelona is the culmination of multiple moments]</b> A moment like this is worth more than silverware. This season has been a year full of wonderful moments, wonderful moments altogether. Looking forward to games, enjoying games and last Tuesday was like the icing on the cake so far. Wow. That’s exactly the picture we want to draw for the outside world - this is Liverpool. It’s possible here. It’s possible in this club and in this city with the people around. That’s the picture. If that leads to silverware, then wonderful. But we cannot do more. If people judge me on not winning something in the past or winning something in the future, I cannot change that. We do all this for entertainment. The people that go there want to go there and enjoy the game. They think two days before and three days after about this game. Heart surgeries are much more important but I don’t think people want to read as much about heart surgeries as they do about football. That’s clear.<br /><br />If you struggle in a game, they hit the post and the bar but you win it, that’s good for looking back and saying, ‘that year we won it and oh we were lucky’. It’s a nice story but it doesn’t help with development. The job is to develop as far and as high as possible so it gets more and more likely that you win silverware and that’s what we’ve done so far. Now we go to a final and we’ll play it, learn from the past few years and see what we can do there</p>

It’s really very important that you are empathetic, that you try to understand the people around you, and that you give real support to the people around you. Then everybody can act. That’s what leadership is: have strong people around you with a better knowledge in different departments than yourself, don’t act like you know everything, be ready to admit, ‘I have no clue in the moment, give me a couple of minutes and then I will have a clue probably’.

Everyone in football knows it was so special and it is not something you will see often in your life. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have gone from being the not most attractive girl in the village to a supermodel. We are one of the five or six best clubs in Europe again. I do not know when that was last the case but it was a while ago. That is why I am happy for the people. They see where their club is and think, ‘Look at that. Look at that red. That is Liverpool’. This is what we feel now.<br /><br />If I am trying to make signings I don’t have to convince players anymore and tell them what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is. That is obvious. I never had so many messages as I did after both <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> games. Everybody watched it, and thought, ‘Wow, what was that?’ I have never had so many compliments for the performance of my team. I don’t know how many people watched but there will have been a few in the world. That makes it special as well - one game, a semi-final. There was no other game on the planet with such focus.<br /><br />Silverware-wise I am not sure if that is possible in an era of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> because there is one team above all of us and we have to fight like crazy to be kind of close. But development wise, joy-wise, it can be a golden era and for me it is already. Who connected to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> cannot be happy? Who cannot love what we are doing? Because step by step we are coming closer to everything. Okay, we didn’t do it again in the league because of City, but we are again in a final and it is still very positive. Who can ever promise silverware? I can’t do that. But in terms of the development of the club, putting the club where it belongs? We are there. This year was our first try for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We could not try before because we had no weapons to try to be champions. This year, after the first five games, I was like, ‘We can try. We are in the flow’. It forced us to a new level and City to a new level. Now we have to do it again and again</p>

What happened then is football and without luck, it wouldn’t have been possible. We needed a good goalkeeper, we needed a sensational defence and we needed a lot of courage to go through as we did.

Of course we move on. It’s not that wherever we go it’s like, ‘Morning, we won the Champions League!’. But why should we forget it? It’s just something that should give the boys more confidence - that’s important. But if you only use confidence you have no chance, but nobody should worry about this team. It’s not about being finally satisfied, happy or done with our careers because we won the Champions League, there is so much to go for. We smelled really how it feels - we played the final, we won the final, we came into the city, we saw the city and saw the people. That’s something you can get addicted to, you want to have that much more often</p>

I don’t want to sound like a moaner, but this is an obvious thing. We need to see how we deal with it. The Brazilians finished the season on an absolute high winning two trophies, for Mo it was slightly different but I’m constantly in contact with him and all three of them are fine.

It’s a not a long-term project where the boy has to think he has to wait five years to play for us, but it’s not necessarily for this moment. We don’t struggle in the centre-back position, we have a lot of options. Last year, there was a time when we had just one left plus <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>. That should not happen again.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> must learn to deal with Champions League glory]</b> The players aren’t the problem. How would they change in four or five weeks? The new situation is that it was a big achievement for the club, a big achievement for each individual. They had a completely different summer. Everybody is talking to you about it. If you win something then everybody feels the need to tell you first of all congratulations, then where they watched, how they felt, how their family felt, how their friends felt, how their dog felt. It’s all nice but of course it keeps you in that moment. I want to be completely focused on the new season from a specific point. That’s the one thing. When we said we have to get rid of the backpack of the history of the club so we can make a step in the right direction, we have to make sure our own history - even though it’s a very good one - doesn’t keep us in that moment.

That’s one reason. Ours was the first year on that level. We have to prove we can be on that level again. That’s how it is. The 97 points were no coincidence but it’s not like we outplayed all the teams, like we shot them out of the stadium constantly. We needed tied games, close games a lot. We were a real result machine last year, it was really, really impressive. The champions are favourites. They didn’t lose a player - they have lost Kompany, sorry, and brought in another one. I knew they would do something <b>[in the transfer market]</b>. If somebody asks if we’re favourites in the Champions League we probably couldn’t deny it. We don’t think it’s like this, but then we are in the final twice in a row so obviously we know the way to the final. Does that mean we will be in the final again?

  <p><b>[Klopp reveals how he turned <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> into mentality giants]</b> Look, if a player has no talent in football, I can’t make him a great player. But in terms of mentality, I think human beings have it. I think it is in them. The explanation for me is this. How long can I hang on the edge of a mountain with one finger, when I will only save my own life? I have no clue, maybe 10 seconds, maybe a little longer? But if, on the other hand, I have my little boy, and I have to save him, I could hang there for three days - in my imagination, anyway. I’d do it for him, not for myself. The more you realise the different things you do for different people, how valuable it is, the easier it is to go over your limit. These boys have that talent. They would hang on the mountain edge for four years for each other, I have no doubt!<br /><br />Of course, you can learn about mentality. We are not ‘mentality giants’ when we are born. Nobody is. Life makes us what we are. In this case, football and bad experiences can help us a lot. You lose a game and it’s not so nice, but if you use it, it can make sense. If you don’t use it, it’s useless. The little defeats in life, the little defeats in the outside world and in football, they can make you stronger, they can create mentality. And if you then put the different parts together, different people with different stories, it can create one mentality. It’s really nice to be a part of that here<br /><br />When I came in, I said that nobody likes this team, not even the team! That was the truth, but that’s completely different now. It’s development, it’s time, patience that you give the boys. And it’s bringing quality in as well<br /><br />We had only two signings where we thought ‘Right, they absolutely have to be a slam dunk. That was Ali and Virg. The others, they had to develop. They were still kind of projects, where we had to see if they could do it in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, if they could do it consistently, all that stuff. <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Gini Wijnaldum</a> and <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>, for example, they were relegated and they came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They were easy picks for us, but they were not obvious picks from the outside. We had to work with these players, all of them<br /><br /><b>[Asked to put his finger on why he had ability to connect with his players]</b> I like people. Life is about relationships. Not only with players, but people in general. With players, it’s the same. It all starts with the phrase I used when I first came. I’m the friend of my players, but not the best friend<br /><br />There are always a few ups and a few downs, which is normal. But, in general, it’s about respect. They have to respect me as a human being and as their boss, and I have to respect them. It depends how you look at it. The decisions I make can be always hard or always easy. I cannot really make a mistake when they are all fit, because of the quality of the team. The decision will always be right, and the others have to respect it and accept it. They want to play more often, of course, but they know we have 11 in the line-up and we will need more than 20 over the course of a season. And if you are in a very good shape, you will have a very good chance to play a lot of games. Even if you have a struggle here or a struggle there, you will still have the chance to play games. They appreciate the situation a lot. They look left and right and see world-class players, and that is a good situation to be in!<br /><br />With any relationship, friendship, work colleague, whatever, the proof is always ‘How is it when it’s not going so well?’. And these were the moments when we came closer together. We lost the final, we lost three finals, and the boys were still able to look in each other’s eyes. They like to be around each other, and I like to be around them sometimes too<br /><br /><b>[For a second, just a second, he pauses, lost in his thoughts.

We have the team, now let’s work with the team and see what we do with it later. New players are never the only solution. And making this team stronger, the starting line-up, that’s really difficult and very expensive and we don’t have that money. That’s how it is. You cannot go out with £150m or £200m and just say, ‘Yes, that’s the guy we need and he can make us better’. Because, also, that would only be if one of the others cannot play. These players, you can’t really get, because they ask, ‘When will I play?’ and I have to tell them, ‘When he is ill or when he leaves.’ It makes it even more difficult.

A new player came in and struggled and so it was the same players who played again. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had the class of ‘92. How long did they stay together? They changed a few after <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> got older and brought in Van the Man <b>[<a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>]</b> or whoever. You do not change completely. We are a good team together in a very difficult league with a lot of competitors desperate to get the position we are in. Nobody knows how it will look exactly but Sunday showed we will be fine and the rest is what we make of it.<br /><br /><b>[Klopp expects the league to be more competitive than last year]</b> For me, it looks like this season will be different because there was a big gap between the other teams and us and City. It looks like we will all be closer to each other than last season. If that is the case then you cannot get 97 or 98 points. We don’t know in this moment. The only thing we know is that nothing will happen for us in a positive direction if we don’t win our games. We have to start with that on Friday. Friday for us is deadline day because pre-season is over and now we have to perform as good as possible</p>

For me, it’s clear and obvious not a penalty because Callejon jumps before there’s any contact. But we can’t change that. We have to be critical with ourselves. We could have done better. They did well in a lot of moments, we played a lot of good football that we didn’t finish off. We had our chances. There were moments when we wanted a free kick. I don’t understand why there was no free kick when Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> goes down, up and down, up and down. You think ‘what’s happening here?’. It kept the intensity of the game, but what I said, we controlled moments but didn’t have a lot of chances at the end. You saw a lot of respect from both sides where we both defended well, but each ball we lost or they lost was immediately a threat. In these situations, you have to finish it off. I think one situation, Sadio was running, if he makes two more steps and shot, but from the beginning he wanted to pass the ball, in the end you’re like make another step and you can do it yourself. We made these decisions that were not right tonight and we have to accept the result<br /><br />It should hurt because there were opportunities to win the game. This was a much better game than the last time we played them and they won 1-0 in the last minute. It was an open game.

We were running, they were running and that killed everyone on the pitch. Then we started controlling it again but conceded a penalty. That doesn’t help. I don’t think it’s a penalty.

If you have a good plan, if you have good players, which is what they obviously have, then they can win the competition. We experienced that you don’t have to be the best team in the world to win the Champions League.

It’s not a physical problem tonight. We have to finish the situations off. How everybody is in life, you need positive moments and you can run forever. We didn’t have really positive moments tonight.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has overseen some of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s most productive transfer business of the modern era and admits that his recruitment philosophy is to seek out world-class potential]</b> In football, there are two ways to improve. One is to sign good players and the second is training, but having time together is always good. We don’t start at minus 20 and say ‘by the way, set-piece, we do this, we do that’ and you have to explain to six players and you think ‘oh God!’. Having a basis is brilliant, but you need world-class players and if they are not world-class already, they need the world-class potential. That is what we need at a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I think that is what we tried to do and it I think it worked pretty well. All the boys have improved a lot since we were together and that is what you have to do. So whatever we achieved, we did it because the boys always took the next steps, got more mature, got more confident and more convinced about the way we play. I think meanwhile, it becomes really natural for the boys and that is so important. For us, our big target was to qualify for the Champions League and it was clear we wanted to do that. But it’s the most difficult league to do this in, in England, but it happened somehow<br /><br />I didn’t look at it as having to change a lot. OK, it was clear that something is not going exactly how the people want it to go. I said it before and it is pretty much a famous phrase, nobody likes this team, not even the team likes the team, so that was something we had to change first and foremost. We have to feel the value they have, that they are in the right place and the right club and the history of the club doesn’t feel too much on their shoulders and all these things, so, those were the things we had to change immediately</p>

I told them the truth of the situation: ‘The last time <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> won in Munich, most of you were still in your Pampers.’ Then I started playing some scenes from Rocky IV on the screen. The one with Ivan Drago. A classic, in my opinion. Drago is running on the treadmill, and he’s hooked up to the big computer monitors and the scientists are studying him. I told the boys, ‘You see? <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> is Ivan Drago. The best of everything! The best technology! The best machines! He’s unstoppable!’ Then you see Rocky training in Siberia in his little log cabin. He’s chopping down pine trees and carrying logs through the snow and running up to the top of the mountain.<br /><br />I told the boys, ‘You see? That’s us. We are Rocky. We are smaller, yes. But we have the passion! We have the heart of a champion! We can do the impossible!’ I was going on and on, and then at some point, I look out to all my boys to see their reaction. I was expecting them to be standing up on their chairs, ready to go run up a mountain in Siberia, going absolutely crazy. But everyone is just sitting there, staring at me with dead eyes. Completely blank. They’re looking at me like, ‘What in the world is this crazy man talking about?’ So then I realised, ‘Wait, when did Rocky IV come out, 1980-something? When were these boys born?’ Finally, I said, ‘Wait a minute, boys. Please raise your hand if you know who Rocky Balboa is?’ Only two hands went up.<br /><br />Everyone else, ‘Nope, sorry, boss.’ My entire speech - nonsense! This is the most important match of the season. Maybe the most important match of some of the players’ lives. And the manager has been screaming about Soviet technology and Siberia for the last 10 minutes! Can you believe this? I had to start my whole speech over from scratch. You see, this is the real story. This is what actually happens in life. We are human beings. Sometimes, we embarrass ourselves. That’s how it is. We think we’re giving the greatest speech in the history of football, and we’re actually talking complete nonsense. But we get up the next morning and we go again. Do you know the strangest part of that story? I honestly cannot be sure if we won or lost the match. I am pretty sure that I gave this speech in 2011 before we won 3-1, and that certainly makes for a much better story! But I can’t be 100% sure. This is one thing about football that people don’t always understand. The results, you forget. You get them all mixed up</p>

We gave <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> an opportunity to play the way they wanted to play with five at the back etc. They were hardworking. Our orientation wasn’t good enough. We felt under pressure when we weren’t and could have turned inside at some opportunities.<br /><br />The first goal I think everyone can agree it was a foul but with VAR it is not a clear foul. That is the situation. We didn’t lose but it was an obvious foul. There was clear contact and <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> goes down. They carried on and counterattacked. Yes, there is contact, I’m sure they said that but it is not a ‘clear foul?’ That doesn’t work. That’s just not how it should be. Then we got a disallowed goal. I didn’t see it back but it was probably handball but everything just seemed to go against us. We changed a little bit our formation and had these moments.

Although not certain, the strong likelihood is that a number of our younger players will feature in some capacity tonight. In Milton Keynes, <a href="caoimhin-kelleher.html">Caoimhin Kelleher</a>, Ki-Jana Hoever, <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a>, <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> and <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> all started and equipped themselves superbly. Herbie Kane, <a href="pedro-chirivella.html">Pedro Chirivella</a> and <a href="sepp-van-den-berg.html">Sepp van den Berg</a> all came on off the bench. The attitude these players showed in the last round is exactly what will be required this evening, if again given the opportunity.<br /><br />They show the right attitude and the perfect amount of hunger each and every day they train with us at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>. They show us, in their actions, that they understand what an immense privilege it is to represent a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - it’s an honour all of us blessed to work here feel. Clearly the ability of these players is not in question. It is their talent that has brought them here and kept them here. At this stage of their careers it is about a variety of other factors - and being ready to grasp an opportunity is a big part of it.<br /><br />It is appropriate to point to <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> when discussing this. This month three years ago he made his first-team debut. Against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at the weekend he made his 99th appearance for the senior side. The reason he has achieved this in such a short space of time, one of the four youngest in LFC history I believe, isn’t just because he has amazing ability. It is because of how he has handled himself, taken his chances and dealt with setbacks and difficulties. There won’t be a player in our current first-team squad who hasn’t faced these challenges at a young age. It is the job of all us to help them and nurture them and give them an environment to grow, develop and flourish. I am confident we are doing this</p>

I don’t say anybody is doing it on purpose<br /><br />We still have to learn, we still have to improve, we do, we will, I know that. Sometimes you need to get knocks but so far, we could sort it, most of the time. Yes of course when you score these kinds of goals, it’s lucky but it’s not that we didn’t deserve to win the game. I never thought a second about ‘did we lose already?’ or ‘can we win?’. We just have to try to score, that’s everything. It’s not that I think because now we have a couple of comebacks today is another comeback</p>

If the centre is closed, then it makes sense to use the wing. But if you use the wing constantly, then usually the centre opens up a little bit.

But it’s not like a long-ball idea where you are <b>[always]</b> hitting it long and going for the second ball.<br /><br />It’s just one option for us and it’s difficult to defend.

We must be in the moment. We saw just how tight the group was last season. The very last kick of the very last group game could have put us out. If you, for even half a second, lose sight of how hard this competition is and how precious each and every point is, trust me, we will not have the experiences like we enjoyed the last couple of seasons.<br /><br />A Champions League game, be it group or knockout, is a heavyweight world title fight every time. Every team you face has the quality to beat you and to knock you to the canvas. These teams don’t just have a puncher’s chance, they are winners with a winner’s approach. If you have the wrong attitude or the wrong mindset you will lose. There is no question of this. I’m not particularly interested what happens elsewhere in the other groups but I am pretty sure it is the same in all of them. The final answer for group standings will almost certainly go to the last game again.<br /><br />I have no worries about our approach because I know this team and this club is streetwise enough to know what is needed. We have that institutional knowledge ingrained in us that a Champions League night, be it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> or away, is an occasion to relish and respect. As a club we don’t take these nights for granted and that must show in our performance. And by ‘our performance’ I mean all of us. Players, management, staff and supporters. We all come here and show our best face. Genk absolutely will - so if we don’t, we risk our future in a competition we are in love with.

How long it will take <b>[to recover]</b>, we’re not sure 100 per cent but it looks pretty sure he will not be involved in the Christmas fixtures. We have solutions for the position. We can replace him. We’ve played good without him, but now it’s important to get him doing the right things and get him back as soon as possible. Until then, we have to find solutions. We’re not the only team with injured players.

We have to play football and win football games again.<br /><br />It’s not that nobody is as good as him. It’s different quality. Gini came on in that position and was brilliant. We just have to make it work. Fab couldn’t have played all the games from now until March. It’s not cool, but we’re in contact with him. We think a lot about it - not in the case of ‘oh my God, how can we deal with it?’ - just in the case of ‘let’s do the right thing for Fab, let’s do the right thing for the team<br /><br />It’s not too long ago we spoke about how we rely so much on our front three. I couldn’t care less who scores - I’m really happy when the ball is in the net. Of course, it’s good, but I still think we could have scored more goals, to be honest.

Graham <b>[Potter]</b> is doing a really good job. That’s our issue, not who scores. After that game, pretty much everybody has this kind of three games a week coming up now.

Peter and Pep have contributed just as much as I have to the development of this team and although as the manager, many may see me as the face of the club, their input and expertise is invaluable to what we’re looking to achieve.<br /><br />I have worked with Pete for many years now, going back to my time at Mainz and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. And even now I am still amazed at the things he spots during a game. He has an incredible talent and one that is priceless for us. It has been one of the best professional experiences for me to see him grow and become the coach he now is.

He is so smart, so insightful and so important to us.<br /><br />Pep, what can I say? What this guy doesn’t know about football isn’t worth knowing! I have never met a guy more passionate and dedicated about the game. I only got to know him when I first arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but I instantly fell in love with his infectious commitment and knowledge of the game. He left for a period and came back - but he came back in a more senior capacity and he’s flourished since.

But going beyond Pete and Pep, these new deals are a mark of not only our collective belief in our project, but also a sign of our development so far.<br /><br />We always say it is a collective effort at Melwood; it’s not just about me, the players or my coaching team, everybody who works here contributes in their own way to what happens on the field and how we have progressed as a club - that’s why we have everybody’s names on a wall in a corridor here.

Michael Edwards and the team deserve a lot of credit. It’s not hard to see why Salzburg is a favoured destination for players with real talent and hunger.

  <p><b>[Angry Klopp hammers <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> in lengthy rant on AFCON scheduling]</b> You really want to open this book now? So, I couldn’t respect the African Cup of Nations more than I do because I like the competition. I watched it a lot in the past in my life, very interesting tournament, most difficult circumstances a lot of times and the players, what they make of it, sensational players. It’s not the last time you see the players as they turn up in Europe, they turn up everywhere. But it is an obvious problem that you play a tournament in the middle of the season, although it makes more sense for Africa to play it in our winter when the weather is better for them - I get that. The only problem is it’s a general problem.<br /><br />A couple of things which are not okay: one thing is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> plans a tournament in the summer of 2021 <b>[the Club World Cup]</b>, a week later the actual African Cup of Nations would have started I think, or maybe two weeks later, another tournament for a lot of world-class players. I mentioned that in the past. I am not sure if that was part of the decision when they thought ‘okay, it makes no sense to play it after that tournament, it makes sense to play it in the winter’, or was the weather the real <b>[reason]</b>. It means another tournament, it’s too many tournaments still. That’s one thing.<br /><br />The other thing is it doesn’t help African players. We will not sell Sadio, Mo or Naby now because they have a tournament in January and February - of course not - but if you have to make a decision about bringing in a player it is a massive one because before the season you know for four weeks you don’t have them. That’s a normal process and as a club you have to think about these things. It doesn’t help the players, for sure. But these decisions are made without asking the players, without asking the managers, without asking anyone. It is just a decision.<br /><br />It is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> who should sort all of that as head of all the different associations. It doesn’t look like being involved, they are still happy having their 21-team World Cup offering a lot of money, I don’t know the exact numbers but it must be a lot of money for all the clubs involved. But I don’t think it is just one problem for this country: European Championships, world championships, it’s like no-one can live without that, it’s a natural right to have this but we forget these tournaments are played by players, they don’t have a break.<br /><br />I feel massively for <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, I now hear he may not be in the Euros. For the first time some English people in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> may think ‘Oh, too many games maybe’. Something has to happen for them to really start thinking about it. Now they send all these guys in winter again, in the middle of a season to a tournament in different circumstances, and coming back from the African Cup of Nations is not easy to take. But the welfare of the players no-one thinks about. These are really important things.<br /><br />The African Cup of Nations going back to January is, for us, a catastrophe. On top of that we have absolutely no power, so if we did say: ‘We don’t let him go’ the player is suspended. How is that possible that the company who pays the player cannot decide if the player has to stay or not. If you would say: ‘Let’s play the African Cup of Nations but the players play in other countries, not in Africa’, it still would be a great tournament but not <b>[involving]</b> the superstars, the superstars of tomorrow. I don’t say that would be a solution for it but it’s strange we have absolutely no say.<br /><br />If a player is injured and cannot play for us we have to send him to Africa and they have a look and in one or two weeks they are back. We just sit there and plan the route, the flight for the boys, and say ‘There you go, have the boys’. Nowadays it should not be like this. But I speak here about it and no-one will listen. It is like the biggest waste of time ever. The moaner from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or whatever is again on track. As long as nothing changes I will say it all the time. It is because it is about the players, not one second about me. There are so many things to sort but all these guys never find time to sit around one table and make a general schedule. All these different games to play and no break for the players. Let’s respect that, but if you have that break don’t make a replay in this break. This would help massively</p>

Hopefully, the pitch will be OK - I have no idea so far about any circumstances. That is proper cup and I like that. Is it a test? Yes, maybe, but it is not like I test the players, it is a test in general as you play against a team who fights the fight of their life and we have to show how important the next round is to us</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp looked on the bright side of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first defeat in 44 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches]</b> We were going to lose a game at some time, and we didn’t wait for it but it was clear it would happen. Tonight it happened and I see it rather positive that we got close to these records. Now we can play free football again and don’t have to try to get a record. We just have to try to win football games again, and that’s what we will do. I am not celebrating a 44-game run. Some people have said other numbers, and I’m not sure which is the right one because I don’t care who is right. I don’t know, I’m not interested<br /><br />But I know things like this are really difficult, because the boys have to be absolutely everything. Tiredness wasn’t a problem, no. Shape isn’t something you can take for granted, form isn’t something you can take for granted.<br /><br />Why do we have the amount of points we have? Because we fought against each little feeling in the body when it was like this or that or our concentration level looked like it would drop, against misfortune, everything. That’s why we have the amount of points we have.<br /><br />Other teams did the same but couldn’t get the same amount of points because it’s so difficult. It’s not easy to explain why tonight it didn’t happen for us, but it shouldn’t be the biggest sensation in world football. We lost that battle. What can I say now, that it’s not acceptable? It’s not that we don’t think it’s important because we won so many games, but we don’t think it’s the biggest catastrophe in the world of football<br /><br />To beat the best club side in the world at the moment is testament to how we played. So, it’s very satisfying, but it’s just one game. We’ve got 10 games left and they’re all going to be very important. We’ve got to try to emulate what we’ve done today in terms of performance. I’m really proud of the players and they should be really proud of how they’ve coped with a difficult situation. In the context of our season, it’s a really important three points. We knew we would have to be at our best today, and I think we were.</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp regrets celebrating in front of linesman amid VAR frustration]</b> To be honest, yes, that happened. Would I do it now? No. But in this moment I just don’t understand how this could be a goal. There are situations, we talk about it, stuff like this, but now we have to make a decision. This shows the problem of VAR still existing. It’s not a VAR, it’s not a system, it’s a human being and the rules. It was a foul. The touch was enough to let Joe struggle - it was a foul, nothing else. They score a goal in the next situation, the ref lets it run, that’s why we have VAR, so we can have a look later. Two or three weeks ago, the VAR made really difficult decisions on one matchday in two different games - I think with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <b>[Manchester]</b> City, I’m not quite sure. But <b>[I was]</b> like, ‘Wow, how is that possible that someone sits there and doesn’t see it?’ So now, for me, the question is how is it possible you have a look at it and don’t say, ‘Ah, it’s a foul’. Mike Dean <b>[the fourth official]</b> I’m sure saw it was a foul, but it’s not his job, he cannot intervene anymore, so it’s then VAR. And the VAR hides behind the phrase ‘not clear and obvious’. It makes no sense<br /><br />A foul is a foul, no foul is no foul, you can let it go, whatever, it’s no problem. But if it’s that clear and you look at it and say, ‘Come on, play on’, nobody felt comfortable after that. Not the ref, everybody knew something happened here which is not okay. That is easy to sort with someone sitting in the room in front of a screen says, ‘Yeah, come on, foul’. That’s it. I understand 100 per cent <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> maybe sees it different, but it’s a clear, clear foul. Arms like this, it’s not possible in that situation.

The ref doesn’t see it, Mike Dean <b>[the fourth official]</b> is next to me, saying, ‘Have a look, have a look’. Then VAR says it’s not clear and obvious because you can maybe say in England that the arm like this is still allowed. I don’t know how that’s possible.

But if it happens, then thank God it isn’t my problem. People can say what they want, I hope they don’t do it too harshly, but I’ll never get that information and will never use it. I make my own decisions. In no team, whether it’s a football team or in an office or whatever part of life, can you have people who are brilliant all in the same area. It just doesn’t work. If you have somebody who moves left or right, then you have no answers any more. You need a mix of personalities<br /><br />It’s very important that you keep your nerve, but I was never worried about that. It’s not just about keeping your nerves, it’s about fighting all the stuff that works against you at the moment. True, for one-and-a-half years, not a lot of these things worked against us but in the last two weeks they did. So we have to fight them. We can’t ignore them and think they won’t happen again. We aren’t that kind of team, or that kind of club. We’ve always had to work really hard for all the things we have got. I saw this on Saturday, and am more than happy</p>

We accept it of course but it doesn’t feel right tonight. I realise I am a really bad loser, especially when the boys put such an effort in against world class players on the other side who defend with two rows of four.

The second goal was a bigger problem. After the second goal the legs were a bit tired. Everything that looked really natural in the first 90 minutes became a bit stiff.

  <p><b>[Klopp reveals what he’s been doing during coronavirus lockdown]</b> I didn’t cut the grass but I tried the dance of Ox! Not as bad as you probably think! It’s very important in these times that we all show we take this situation seriously, but we are human beings. At the moment we are at home and when you are at home, you cannot do something to help outside. We are not health workers, we don’t work in a supermarket. You have to keep your own mood up and you have to keep the mood up for other people. If the boys do anything on Instagram, as long as it’s in a legal frame I’m overly happy about it - it just shows they are still cheeky and all that stuff. I like it, I like it a lot. I like the line-ups they do. All these things are really funny. It’s good. I watched a few movies - I watched the Taken trilogy again! To be honest, that’s how it is - you do a lot of things you usually don’t do. I’m still in that period. Two weeks is long but it’s not that long<br /><br />We said it now often enough, and I think everybody knows, football is not the most important thing in the world. One hundred per cent not. In this moment it’s clear what is. But the only way to get football back as soon as possible, if that’s what the people want, the more disciplined we are now the earlier we will get, piece by piece by piece, our life back. That’s how it is. There is no other solution in the moment, nobody has another solution.<br /><br />We have to be disciplined by ourselves, we have to keep the distance to other people. We can still do some things, not a lot, but we have to just calm down a little bit with things. Yes, outside the economy has to carry on, that will start again. But the lower the number will be when we go out again, the number of people infected, that’s what I understand, the better it is. It will not be like nobody anymore after the next few weeks but the curve will flatten, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />We have to give our people in the hospitals, our doctors, the chance to treat the people with serious issues with full concentration. We have to give people time to build ventilators, we have to give people time to find solutions. There will be a moment when other smart people find a vaccine for the virus. But until then, we have to make sure we do the best possible for all the people out there. You hear now more and more it’s not only the elderly and weaker - it’s not only that, there are younger people involved who can die of it as well. It’s not about that, it’s about just, show heart and a bit of sensibility and do the right thing: stay at home as long as we have to. And then at one point we will play football again as well, 100 per cent. I couldn’t wish more for it because of a few really good reasons, how you can imagine. I can’t wait actually, but even I have to be disciplined and I try to be as much as I can</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> stars facing fines if they fail to report to video calls on time]</b> Some people may say it’s like a normal meeting or normal session we have! But it’s not like this. I like that as well. When we start at 10, the chat is open from 9.30 on and pretty much everybody is already in. Especially in the first few, they were all pretty early in the chat, so it was really chaotic. Meanwhile, they join it later now everybody knows how it works technically and stuff like that. So they come later, but in time, which is important - because we fine that as well! Too late in a Zoom session means you have to pay! That’s the best thing of having this situation in 2020 - we have this technical opportunity. Imagine if we would have had that in the ’80s or something like that, it would have been really crazy. Not because of football, because of all the social contact and interaction we can have and use at the moment. That makes a big difference<br /><br />It’s just great. Look, it’s so different. Everything is different in the moment and we do all different stuff. When we have these training sessions, I could have never imagined I would enjoy it that much but it’s just the moment when I see the boys again and that changes everything - for a minute, for an hour, for two hours, however long the sessions are. The boys are all in good spirits; you feel immediately why you miss them so much, because it’s just an exceptional group. You want to be together with them, you want to have them around, you want to be closer to them than you can be. These are the closest moments, apart from exchanging messages with them and asking, ‘How are you?’ and stuff like this. So I enjoy these sessions really a lot. It’s getting worse, the longer it takes. I accept the situation 100 per cent like it is but the longer you don’t see somebody you like, the more it hurts. That’s the situation we are in at the moment</p>

If we will be successful depends on what other clubs are doing as well because they all have a chance to improve things, to do things better. So I have no clue what the future will hold for us.

There are a lot of things we can improve obviously, but we can improve it with this team, which is really great<br /><br />Life is a constant challenge and we realise it in this moment especially because we never faced a challenge like the one we have now. It looks like the situations we had in the past where we thought they are big problems, they look like nothing. Qualifying again for a Champions League final and not winning the league because of a point or 11mm, that could be hard. But we always saw it like this: the only way to get something is to give everything. But it’s not a guarantee. The boys were always ready to give their all, absolutely all and try again and try again and try again. Then there are two possible scenarios. One is you lose the final, one is you win the final. You lose the final, there is still a wonderful experience to go there because you had to qualify from the semi-finals, the quarter-finals, the last 16, you have to go through the group stage. You can take so much confidence from it and that’s what we did from the Champions League defeat against Madrid. It was a strange final and it said nothing about the boys, absolutely nothing. The only thing we realised was we were good enough to cause a few more teams problems now. That was exactly the plan for the next season. In this season we are at the end of April and it didn’t start again, that’s clear, but whenever we can play again - whenever it will be - we will not give up. In the moment when it’s allowed to concentrate on football again for us, we will do that again and we will start with that again and try our best again. We will see when it will be</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp gives insight into his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team selections]</b> The players know a day or two before the game if they play or not. I want them to prepare for it, but I treat them individually. If a player who has played the last 20 games in a row is not playing the next game it’s not a big problem. I have to judge the situation always in the moment. We had situations like in the Champions League last year, second leg when everybody told me that <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> was really angry that he didn’t start. I tell the boys you don’t have to be happy with my decisions, you just have to accept them and after the game, we can speak about it. But before the game, we cannot. If you are in a session and you’re not happy but you train well, come after the game in my office on Monday morning and I can explain it. If you would say I am a friend of players, believe me, come matchday I am the friend of exactly 11 players. All the others have some things to criticise if you would ask them<br /><br />My players aren’t my sons but my sons are now turning 35 and 32, and that’s pretty much exactly the same. There are moments when you are a father, there are moments when you are a friend, there are moments when you have to criticise them. These things are always exactly the same. I always did that with my players as well. We can have a really close relationship and the closer relationship you get, the more you have to tell the truth to the boys because they judge you on that. I explained it once and said I really want to be the friend of my players but I cannot be their best friend. That’s how it is. A friend has to tell you the truth, a friend has to tell you what you can do better, a friend has to - and will - always tell you what is right and what is wrong. That’s exactly what I do, but never in a manner that they cannot get up the next morning. It’s always the same reason: I want to help them. I have no other job. My job is to help the boys to be the best player they can be, and there are a few things to do</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp feared he’d get sacked by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> if he didn’t improve them quickly enough]</b> It was clear we needed time. It was clear we couldn’t fix it overnight. Everybody wanted that but it was clear <b>[it couldn’t be done straight away]</b>. So I had to ask for time, that’s how it is. Before in my career I had never got the sack so I had no real experience with that. But I knew now I’m on a different level <b>[at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> and if I cannot deliver here quick enough then I’m going to get the sack, as easy as that. That’s why I said if I sit here in four years still then something happened (Liverpool improving and winning trophies) probably in between now and then. It’s not that I asked for four years, I asked for a little bit of time. We got that. The nice thing was that after seven or eight games … they (Liverpool’s owners) were really positive about the situation of signing me and that it would be the right one, together with my coaches. They realised ‘okay, yes, they’re on the right path’ and from that moment on they didn’t question it for one second. They were full of faith and trust and said ‘this is the path we’ll stay on and everything will be fine’. Who knows if you can win something in that difficult league but we’ll try this way. But we never really thought about losing finals when we lost them like against <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, City or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Pundits said ‘if he doesn’t win the next one then they have to change something’. That’s how it is. Internally nobody thought like this<br /><br />Some ideas were always the same, the organisation - or the idea about organisation - was similar, where I wanted my teams to win the ball back and stuff like this. These things never really change because I just think they are right, but of course as a manager you have to adapt your style to the quality of the players you have available. The quality increased a lot in the last few years, not only here; at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> it was already different to Mainz. At Mainz it was different from year to year. But it’s all about the organisation. It’s not that I have a fixed idea of how it should be and then I try to push it through with the boys, it’s just I try to understand exactly the quality and skills of the boys and then to use that. Because the pitch in all my career was always the same size and the rules didn’t change too much since I was a manager. So these things are clear, so you have to try to adapt to different situations. Of course, a lot of things changed. The way I work changed; I started alone, now I have a lot of coaches next to me. That’s all different to how it was</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp reveals he was too drunk to remember <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s 2012 double celebrations]</b> The way we celebrated was very original. It was like becoming a champion in the A-Class Northwest. It was a really great celebration with all the zipping and zapping. There would be no such thing today. I was heavily drunk in 2011, but in 2012, after the double, I didn’t really notice <b>[the celebrations]</b>. You can see what alcohol does to people. Do not drink, otherwise, you will lose the memory of important moments in your life<br /><br />It’s right up there. I haven’t been waking up every morning and thinking about April 30, 2011, but after you called I tried to do that for a few days to remind myself of it. Quite a lot has happened in my life, but it’s not the case that I’ve won so much that I get it all mixed up. But 2011 and 12 aren’t so easy because the team didn’t change that much and when I was thinking about the games we played I was trying to remember: was that 2010-11 or 11-12? But I’ve got nothing but great memories and it probably had a huge impact on my career as a coach. We really made the most of what we had. Winning promotion with Mainz was unexpected for all of us and I didn’t know what would happen next, that was such a big thing. But to take these Under-19s to the German title - I felt like they were U-19s - was amazing. It changed our lives and thinking about it now, I’m still in touch with practically all of them<br /><br /><b>[The news that Cologne had taken the lead sent Signal Iduna Park into raptures as <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> sat on the verge of glory, but footage of Klopp shows that he did not drop his trademark hyperactive intensity on the sidelines even then, although he admits he felt deep down the job was complete]</b> Well, I am a coach. I wasn’t able to open the beers when it was 2-0!. It wasn’t over, even though my inner feeling was ‘this is it’, the game was still going. That often happens as a coach, and it’s your job. You have to give orders, shout, think about tactics and so on. Even at times like that, you have to rant and rave at the players. We wanted to win the game - it wasn’t about getting across the line however we could, it was about crossing it in the best way possible. That will be why I was still in match mode.

It was job done, and I really loved it.<br /><br />I know that it was one of the greatest nights of my life, I said it after the game as well.

I felt directly for <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager]</b> Mauricio <b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>]</b>, went to him, gave him a hug and it’s like a strange situation where you are in between being really happy and really feeling for another person. Because I knew exactly that day how he felt. But after that, the next few days were some of the best of my life, 100 per cent. Because it’s so big, it’s so massive. I tried it with different teams so often and I knew as a human being reaching a final is big but without winning it’s not the same, and it was a while ago that I felt I needed the full package by being in the final and winning the final so it was a very, very special moment.<br /><br /><b>[Klopp was quick to savour the moment with his family]</b> I’ve forgot the number already but I think I lost five or six finals before that so you can imagine.

As they were made in Germany, they are now being taken in England. The training centers of the English professional clubs will be the safest. There are no places to be infected at all</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> return from coronavirus break is a joy for ‘strange’ Klopp]</b> Look, I love it. In this part I’m a strange person; when I watch football - other games, not our games - I watch them most of the time without sound because I don’t want to hear the commentary, I’m just interested in the game. So now for me it’s completely normal to watch other football games. I love the game, I’m interested in what they do and stuff like this. I know, football behind closed doors, of course it’s not the same. Why do we have to mention it? We all love it when we have contact, when we get cheered up by the people, when they push us through the yards and all that stuff. We love that but we cannot have it. Why would you think always about something you cannot have in the moment? Use the thing you have in the moment. It looks like it will be possible - and it is in Germany already possible - to play behind closed doors. And the football games were really good; super goals, real fight, tight games, clear games, clear results, a proper fight. Imagine, the first night is a little bit like, ‘Have a look here and there, how will it work, how does it feel?’, but in Germany so many teams play for pretty much everything - they want to stay in the league - and that’s exactly the same what will happen in England.</p>

I couldn’t wait for a while now, so I am really happy that we are able to do this again - going back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>, having small group training and stuff like this. It will be intense, for the coaches especially because a lot of players in small groups means a lot of sessions, but we’ve had enough time to rest so we will be fine. Can’t wait<br /><br />When we start, it goes really again for everything. The competition will make the intensity. So, it’s not about, ‘Oh, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to win two games’. By the way, we have to win two games when we start - it’s not ‘only two’, it’s two. It’s not less or more. We have to win them, it’s not that we want to win the last two or whatever and come through somehow. We want to play the best possible football, better than other teams fighting for the Champions League, fighting to stay in the league. We have to do it, unfortunately, without the best boost in the world and the best kick in your ass in the right moment in the world, from the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> crowd. That’s how it is. I never understood in life why you always want things you don’t have, you cannot have. In this moment we cannot have that, so let’s take the rest and make the absolute best of it<br /><br />Nobody wants to bring anybody into danger, but I think with all the things we know about, sticking to the social distancing rule - especially in the first part - with testing as often as possible and stuff like this, the players will be safe. Germany showed it already - a couple of players had a positive test during the long period, they trained for five weeks and now they play already, stuff like this and they had altogether 10 or 12 positive tests. I hope that we are now in England on the right side of the thing as well. It’s all about when - but you need to re-open step by step different parts of life again. Everybody agrees about that, it’s only about when. It’s now a good moment to do it. Then other things, for sure, will follow</p>

I said before the session, ‘You are here on free will. Usually you sign a contract and you have to be in when I tell you, but in this case if you don’t feel safe, you don’t have to be here’. There are no restrictions, no punishment, nothing. It’s their own decision and we respect that 100 per cent. The boys are fine. We would never put anybody in danger to do what we want to do. Yes, we love football, yes, it’s our job, but it’s not more important than our lives or the lives of other people<br /><br />Brilliant, I really enjoyed it.

That felt pretty special. Then coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and seeing all the boys was nice. Before the session we had to give an introduction to make sure everything went in line. It was a short meeting and then a little bit more about the targets and then we started training. That was the best part for a while, really good. The first 10 players were here, we have groups of five that train at the same time on different pitches obviously, far away from each other. It looked like football and that is what we want to do. For the boys, they had the longest break ever, around nine weeks. The international players usually have around two weeks in the summer, so we need to get used to a lot of things again. But the first impression was really positive</p>

That’s the moment when we want to be at 100 per cent. It’s roundabout three weeks until then, that’s good. We want to use that and we will. It’s our pre-season; how I said, we don’t expect a long break in between the seasons, so this is a very important period for us. We never had nine weeks without football training in our lives - since we played football, pretty much. That’s all different but interesting as well. We enjoy the situation, that’s really all good. It makes all the difference for us, to be honest, to come together and have this hour or two here together. You get this contact, feedback as well on the pitch directly, not via a computer or a screen. It’s a massive, massive lift.<br /><br />It’s <b>[been]</b> a massive organisational challenge, to be honest. What (first-team operations manager) Ray Haughan did in that department is unbelievable - where we can park, where we can walk and all that stuff. When you make the step from 10 players of two groups of five, to nearly 30, that’s massive. We still have to stick to the same things. So, we are fully concentrated when we come in here, let me say it like this; that we do the right things, that we get the temperature tested and all these things. It’s not like it usually is. It’s completely fine but it’s just when you come here it’s not like, ‘Yippee!’ - you think, ‘Where do I have to drive, where is somebody who gets my temperature?’ and all that stuff. That’s how it is in the moment. The boys are still the same really good bunch of boys, and that helps a lot. We are in a good moment, we enjoy it. Hopefully we can make progress in the next two or three weeks, there are a lot of things that need to be organised still, obviously. We need to get hopefully a couple of <b>[bits of]</b> information but we take it like it is and use each second we are together<br /><br />That’s what we were all waiting for. But now it’s always like this. You were waiting for that, somebody tells us we could start, that’s good. Now we know, from a training point of view, what we have to do when and when we have to be at 100 per cent in the best way, how we can train in different intensities. That was very important. Now, of course, it’s more and more interesting when we play where, the times are really important because we will see how we can organise the travel stuff. So, the situation keeps us busy, that’s absolutely OK, but on the pitch everything is fine, that’s really great. Around, we organise it as good as possible and use the situation</p>

In the conversations we have had, he has been the first to express that my priority as a manager needs to be the players who are at this club for longer than just the rest of this season. He wants to be here to finish the job and do it properly, but it says everything about him that his biggest concern was blocking the progress and opportunity of a player who is under contract for next season also. But his role is too important to lose him before this season is done. So, it’s fantastic we can delay our messages of gratitude and good luck until the end of July now.<br /><br />Now isn’t the moment to review my time here because the focus needs to be on the remaining nine matches and the club finishing the season in the best manner possible.

  <p><b>[Klopp praises <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s young talent after thrashing <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> in friendly]</b> It is just so nice. Not only the goal, but when you see the situations when he came on, I think the first pass was between the two strikers, he got it in the No.6 position where he is calm, turns and passes the ball out. We can teach the boys a lot, but they have to bring a lot. Obviously the basis for Leighton is not too bad and Jake <b>[Cain]</b> did really well, as well. All of the boys. For Sepp <b>[Van den Berg]</b> it is always hard for centre-halves. We have four, so sitting outside <b>[but]</b> he looks really promising in training sessions. Ki-Jana, centre-half and right-back and looks really good. You see them - when Harvey <b>[Elliott]</b>, Curtis <b>[Jones]</b> and Neco <b>[Williams]</b> played, it looked good as well. It’s coming, it’s nice and nice they are here and training with us. The way we play helps the players to feel safe; everybody is defending and you should never feel alone in a big area where you have no chance to sort the situation. That’s what I really like and for the boys it was really good<br /><br />It was not only a workout; for us, it was a really important test and we wanted the players to go for 45 minutes <b>[but]</b> because of a few little issues we couldn’t do that, so we didn’t have enough ‘first-team players’, I would say, so that’s why we decided to let three players go for 60 minutes. That’s ok. It looked really good, obviously. It looked really good, pretty much from the beginning. Yes, you have to get used again to playing against a deep-defending side and stuff like this. <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> had a playing build-up from time to time, so we could work on the high press as well.

That’s the truth.<br /><br />When I see the numbers here in ­England and then in Germany, I think. Look, it’s not perfect in Germany, people have died and have been ill. But, in terms of living your life, it is completely different. If you want to enter a shop in Germany, but don’t wear a face mask, then you aren’t allowed in.

We were lucky in that moment but apart from that, we were in control. We didn’t have a lot of chances; most of the time we were dominant but they had the biggest chance - that’s how it is. It was a real fight. Both teams showed that they understand it’s a derby - even without a crowd. It was intense, physical, all-in. You saw the derbies we had here before - they were never really better, I have to say! Each team is fighting like crazy so in the end there is not a lot of football. There is space for improvement for us here at Goodison; I like football when it’s slightly different but that’s how it is; we had a proper fight, it was intense and we were ready for that. The players were really in the game, so that’s good. I really liked our defending.; the high press, midfield press, counter-press good. We won a lot of balls<br /><br />Of course we want to make more chances; we have to more clear in situations - pass the ball, shoot in the right moment, more crosses.

  <p><b>[Klopp felt the performance reflected just how much his side want to wrap up the title]</b> You should not underestimate how much this team wants it. This team really wants it. They want to fulfil the wishes of the people at home, really. We all have a common dream but we have to work for it. We have to work our way for it. We can’t play like other teams but we can play pretty good stuff. That is what the boys did. The game was exceptional. From talking about football, it was exceptional from so many points of view. This game will last in my mind for a while. This is where we want to be. This is what we have to show against each and everybody. This is us</p>

We have big dreams and we’ve always had them - that doesn’t mean we can fulfil them, but we have to give them a proper try and that is what we have done since we have been here. Not more, and it will never be less, and the more people dream the more important and stronger it gets. So of course, without the players buying into this philosophy I have no chance, but we will not stop.<br /><br />We have to show that on the pitch obviously and two games here or there and you will tell us: ‘That is not the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> of last year’. It is OK to try but these questions will never come up that we will show you it is possible to do things even longer, not only one year, not only two years because if you into detail you would see we have done it for four years.<br /><br />We try to squeeze everything out and it didn’t work out always, but the intensity was never less, it was just not as successful. The boys are in good age group, more experienced, more confident, more convinced and we should use that as much as we can but we know there are other teams out there who will do the exactly the same to improve their situation and there will be hard fights but that is how <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is, a hard fight every three days.

We want to play football and we are really happy that we are allowed to play again - then when it happened in that moment, it was a pure explosion. When we counted down the last five seconds of the game, the ref counted down a little bit longer than us so we had to look at two or three more passes! Then it was pure…I cannot describe it. It was a really, really nice moment. Directly after it, I felt so empty inside - I cannot believe it, I am really not happy with myself in the moment that I feel like I feel, but it’s just a little bit too much in the moment. I will be fine, nobody has to worry<br /><br />I actually couldn’t be happier; I couldn’t have dreamed of something like that and I never did before last year, honestly. We were not close enough three years ago, a year ago we were really close … what the boys have done in the last two-and-a-half years, the consistency they show is absolutely incredible and second to none.

I was never sure it will happen, but I knew we will become a really good football team. But others are pretty good as well. The consistency makes all the difference. We were good four years ago, we were really good three years, we were unbelievably good last year, the consistency we showed was incredible, and then smashing the record so far this season is absolutely exceptional, and second to none. It’s all about the boys’ commitment, desire and understanding of the club’s heart and soul. That made it happen, and thankfully I am part of this</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp’s bold <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> promise after title win]</b> The last 13 months were pretty special for us, it’s true. I would like to involve the year before because it was an incredible time in my football life. I didn’t experience it before - not that good - the consistency the boys show is so exceptional. We will not stop, we really have to stay focused, because we see the opportunity. I will promise we will improve. But this will not mean we will win everything, but that we will improve. City is exceptional, so I cannot promise that we will win something. If you ask my team at Mainz, they worked hard. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> as well. This group is a mix - we have a lot of world class players, but other clubs do too<br /><br />The consistency comes from the mix of determination, buying into ideas, attitude, character, personality. That’s what makes this group special. They are confident because we won, but they are humble. If they stay humble, we have a good chance to be successful. It helped massively that we won the Champions League. It helps from a confidence point of view - from the nearly man to a winner. We get a super push from our supporters, every two weeks we have the best atmosphere in football. We have a good situation, we use our history instead of being held back by it. We will make sure we are still good from now on<br /><br />If you want to win the league, it’s pretty much not allowed to lose a game. City have never stopped since Pep was there. We will try not to stop, to improve, to make things special. Tomorrow we train, that’s how it is. We have a common dream. We have big dreams. The more people dream the more important and stronger it gets. So we will not stop. f you really go into detail, you’ll see we have been doing this for three, four years. The intensity was never less, we were not as successful. The boys are more experienced, more convinced. But we know other teams are there and will do a lot to improve their situation. There will be hard fights, and the hard fight starts now.</p>

I cannot begin to tell you how much the players and myself appreciated that and I have no doubt that it was one of the reasons why our performance against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> was so good.<br /><br />What I did not love - and I have to say this - was the scenes that took place at the Pier Head on Friday. I am a human being and your passion is also my passion but right now the most important thing is that we do not have these kind of public gatherings.<br /><br />We owe it to the most vulnerable in our community, to the health workers who have given so much and whom we have applauded and to the police and local authorities who help us as a club not to do this.<br /><br />Please - celebrate - but celebrate in a safe way and in private settings, whereby we do not risk spreading this awful disease further in our community.<br /><br />If things were different I would love nothing more than to celebrate together, to have a parade that would be even bigger than the one after we won the Champions League last year, so that we could all share this special moment but it just is not possible<br /><br />We have all done so much to fight Covid-19 and this effort cannot go to waste. We owe it to ourselves and each other to do what is right and at this moment that means being together and being there for one another by being apart<br /><br />When the time is right we will celebrate. We will enjoy this moment and we will paint the city red. But for now, please stay at home as much as possible. This is not the time to be in the city centre in big numbers or to go near football grounds<br /><br />At the start of this crisis I said that we did not want to play in an empty stadium but if it meant that it helped just one person stay healthy we would do it no questions asked and nothing has changed to make me alter this view<br /><br />I already knew and liked the German word solidarität before I came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now I have learned that the English word is solidarity because I have heard it used by our supporters during the last few months<br /><br />For me, it is the word more than any other that captures what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> people are about. It is why they have come together to make PPE, it is why they have delivered food parcels and medicines to people when they have needed it most and it is why they come together in so many different ways during such a difficult time<br /><br />If we can keep on coming together by being separate we will hopefully play a big part in the fight against this disease. I know that we can do this because I have experienced what a difference can be made and the players and myself have benefited from it<br /><br />Hopefully in a few months from now, or longer if necessary, I can write another letter to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Echo to thank you for putting the health of our people ahead of everything else.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss Klopp on transfers, coronavirus and FSG relationship]</b> Covid has of course influenced both sides with ins and outs, that is completely normal. It’s just not likely that it will be the most busy summer in the world. But maybe at a later point in the year, if the transfer window is still open and we know more, then maybe something could happen. I am very confident that we can keep the team together, but all the rest of the planning is ongoing without knowing. We have no idea at the moment. I don’t know when the new season will start. Nobody knows how the future will be, which is very strange<br /><br />Three months ago nobody knew anything about how it would be and now we act a little bit like everything will be fine again. It is a little bit early to guess that. And in football now we get confronted with how much do you want to spend? How much can you spend if you don’t know how much you can have? That is exactly the situation. We all will pay a bill in the end. It’s not only football. Hopefully it is over soon but nobody knows exactly how big the bill will be. I think it’s completely normal that this is a moment we wait a little bit longer with some decisions or just say ‘we pause and try it again like this’. We should not start taking for granted it all will be fine<br /><br /><b>[There was dismay among supporters when Werner, seen as an ideal fit for the Reds’ system and a player with the potential to develop into one of the world’s top forwards, moved to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> earlier this month]</b> This squad… look at it. It is not a squad you have to change now and say ‘OK, we need this position and this position’. If you are a football supporter, you still want a backup for him and him, of course. Even if you are completely happy with the first XI, you still want backups for everyone. We don’t have a first XI, I’d say we have a first 16 or 17, where they can all play to the same level. But this is what we have to use, 100 per cent. And what we want to create are transfers internally<br /><br />So now we have the first glimpses of <a href="neco-williams.html">Neco Williams</a>. He would not be here in this position if we were not convinced. All these boys, Curtis <b>[Jones]</b>, Harvey <b>[Elliott]</b>, Ki-Jana <b>[Hoever]</b>, Sepp <b>[<a href="sepp-van-den-berg.html">van den Berg</a>]</b>, Yasser <b>[Larouci]</b>, Leighton <b>[Clarkson]</b>, Jake <b>[Cain]</b>, all these boys have done really well. And a few I don’t know yet but I will know them soon<br /><br />We cannot spend millions and millions and millions because we think it is nice to do. We want to strengthen this squad, and this squad is strong. The problem with a strong squad is how do you improve a strong squad on the transfer market? It works with money, obviously. That is possible. But it never works only with money. You have to be creative and we try to be creative. We try to find solutions internally. There is still a lot to come. We have three or four players who can still make big, big steps, who are not in the first 12 or 13 so far. That is the pressure we make as well, internally. We have had these discussions throughout the last four-and-a-half years. You asked me if I will find solutions in the transfer market and you are right, we did that, 100 per cent. We did smart business, brought good players in and then did something on the training pitch, and that is not finished yet<br /><br /><b>[Klopp also opened up on his relationship with Fenway Sports Group]</b> The relationship was exceptional from the first day. The first meeting was in New York <b>[in 2015]</b> that’s true. But the first phone call with Mike <b>[Gordon, the FSG president]</b> was before that, three days before maybe, I don’t know. I was still in bed! It was a nice day, I remember that, but I had nothing to do. I had time off and my phone started to ring. I knew that Mike, or someone from FSG, was going to call. I didn’t know Mike at that point. But we had a one-hour talk on the phone. I obviously convinced him in a way that he wanted to meet in New York to bring the deal over the line. That’s how it started. From that moment on, we had a very, very good relationship on a professional basis and a personal basis as well. With Mike, we work closely together - that’s how it is. But it’s Mike, Michael <b>[Edwards, the sporting director]</b> and myself. We pretty much are the transfer committee! They were my first owners, so I can’t compare them. They are the best owners I ever worked with for sure! That’s cool.<br /><br />There is no problem if it doesn’t happen, you don’t need to have a personal relationship maybe in this business. But we have worked brilliantly together and we have a very good relationship. That makes it pretty special. First and foremost, they wanted to support us. Maybe not always at first with money but with a lot of trust and faith in the things we do. That was apparent from the first second. It was always clear. We finished eighth in 2016 - ninth would have been the worst ever, right? - but there was never doubt, not from that side. I’m pretty sure there was doubt from the outside. But from the owners’ side, there was never. They wanted to give us time. They saw the little steps and that helped massively. We could make it, step-by-step</p>

The other players maybe didn’t look at him in that moment. These are the situations we have to change. <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> (Jordan Henderson) could have been there, usually <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> should have been there but he pushed up. If we want to achieve something special, the only way to do that is by being 100 per cent in that specific game, which means in all the specific situations. Do we have to lose 4-0 to learn that? I’m not sure, but it can help. It makes the point absolutely clear<br /><br />That was a special game. People will be speaking about it in 10 years, that it was one of the key moments of the season. I remember exactly how they scored the goal, our goals and other parts of the game, which doesn’t always happen. It was a very important one for us.<br /><br />Villa was not in a bad moment at that time. Since then, a lot of things changed. Can we use this game for our preparation? Not really but in general it was a really important game. Since then, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> changed their system twice. They played a back five and in the last game, they played a diamond, bringing <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> into his best position. We don’t know how they will line up against us. Some people say rhythm is better than a break. If it was an advantage for City last night, it should be an advantage for us against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. They had a week off while we played on Thursday. We have to give Villa a proper fight. In possession, they make the pitch big, play diagonal balls, use their speed. They are good. But usually in games against top-six teams, they don’t have 50-60 per cent of the ball, it’s more like between 25 and 35. But it’s not about that, it’s about what they’re doing in the moments where they have the ball, and us needing to have solutions for that.</p>

We didn’t behave like somebody who became champions a week ago - that was all good. We lacked fluidity, that’s for sure. And in some 50-50 situations they were quicker than us in mind. They used their chances and we didn’t. City were 100 per cent deserving, of course, but a 5-3 would have been possible as well.

I said that and I thought that was clear. I think we proved that point. And City proved they are an unbelievably good team. Isn’t it nice that another team can be champions even when City is around and plays this kind of football? City are incredible. I’ve seen their games - they haven’t played a bad game all season. Even when they lost they still played really good football. But in the end the situation is like it is. We had moments. You watched the game completely calm, why do you ask me if we had decent chances? It makes no sense this question.<br /><br />We had decent chances, so ask me about them. We had chances, we got into situations. We didn’t use them, that’s true. Maybe we wasn’t clear enough but we had moments where we could have score and we didn’t. In football if you don’t score it’s difficult to mention chances as everyone forgets them immediately - even I forget them, but that’s the situation. All is OK. It’s not nice, it’s not what we wanted. I wanted to see we had the right attitude and we did, so I’m fine. And the result we have to take</p>

We try to help them as much possible to become the best player they can be. That’s what we do with all the players but with the younger players, the responsibility is obviously bigger on our side.

  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> drinks break - is it fair?]</b> I like it a lot. If people think that you only need a drinks break when it’s 40 degrees or something outside and, of course, England is not a country where you need a drinks break really often, especially in the north-west or north-east. But, it’s important just to have that because it was always going to be a strange period for the players and we didn’t know how exactly the boys would react. I really like the opportunity to talk. I think from the moment the referee whistles, it starts, it pretty much takes the players 30 seconds for the players to gather around, so you don’t actually have a lot of time with the players. You really go there for a drink, but you can give one or two information. All coaches have the same opportunity in that moment, so that’s good, it’s fair</p>
