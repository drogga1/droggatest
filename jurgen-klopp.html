He scored a nice goal <b>[against Netherlands last Thursday]</b> and that will be good for him. But our only problem is the pace in which developments obviously have to happen in football. You always get asked about a new player in a new club after a really short time of being able to train together, that’s our only problem. Everything else is fine. I hope that in three years we’ll look back and no one remembers the first five or six games. He needs time to integrate in this team; we need time to develop our team play. Now we could have had the time for it, but now <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> is injured. Of course we’ve got <a href="shinji-kagawa.html">Shinji Kagawa</a> as well but he hasn’t played with the team yet. Everything is far from perfect but we’ve got to stabilise our game while we collect results. Most likely we have to do that with a new player in the starting line-up who will have to reclaim his self-assurance as well. That will be hard. When Ciro came back he seemed very relaxed, I think he was very glad his injury wasn’t as bad as feared. The bruise hurts a lot at the beginning but it heals quite fast</p>

So I’m really happy about it. Yes, Mo can keep that standard, for sure. He is still a young player, he can improve. It’s not about scoring only, it’s about other situations as well. He’s so important for us. But he knows and I know that he couldn’t score if he didn’t have the fantastic support of all the other boys. We played fantastic passes. Sadio’s idea in the moment before Mo scored the first goal - I don’t think a lot of people in the stadium saw that it would be an opportunity. That was really important</p>

During the week they follow us wherever we go, they read everything about us, and it’s very positive - it’s the best thing you can do in your spare time actually … if you love football, obviously. I like it a lot that we have such a positive moment and the people really have a lot of good, good moments during the season. Hopefully it may continue like this</p>

We have won something and got it in our trophy cupboard, but our attitude does not change. I couldn’t have imagined it when we sang the year before at the funeral party that, ‘We bring it back to Liverpool’ and it would work out. We got there. So let’s try to get there again next season. We will not even think about stopping<br /><br /><b>[Klopp admits he was taken aback by the scenes, including on an open-top bus tour]</b> It was absolutely overwhelming. It was too much to comprehend, one of the best things I’ve witnessed in my life. Everyone tells you it will be something special if you win something with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and this was proper proof. I was thinking, ‘Wow, that was brilliant!’ then the bus came around the corner and you are like, ‘What the heck is that?’ I could not imagine the noise. We made so much eye contact with so many people - people in their late 60s or early 70s. There was one guy and he was like this: Boom! Boom! and he is shouting, ‘I love you!’. I was like, ‘Stop, calm down! My God.’ That is only one example of thousands. It meant so much to us and obviously meant so much to the people. It was absolutely brilliant. Even now, you wake up in the morning and realise it is still true</p>

That’s the situation we face at the moment, that’s early pre-season, we have to do it like this and use it as the main sessions. How we conceded the goals was due to lack of organisation around the situations. When you change a lot in the team, then it’s quite difficult to have the perfect organisation. This will be better later in pre-season. I still don’t like what I see in the game very often in pre-season, but I know the reason for it</p>

That would have been the worst thing. But between the worst thing and that now would have been a few levels I would have preferred. I knew before we started that it would be exceptionally difficult because of the situation. We have to adapt to a few things and we have to create a specific spirit. For this, we have a week’s time. For the first time since the Champions League final we have 99 per cent of the squad tomorrow <b>[Monday]</b>.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> must learn to deal with Champions League glory]</b> The players aren’t the problem. How would they change in four or five weeks? The new situation is that it was a big achievement for the club, a big achievement for each individual. They had a completely different summer. Everybody is talking to you about it. If you win something then everybody feels the need to tell you first of all congratulations, then where they watched, how they felt, how their family felt, how their friends felt, how their dog felt. It’s all nice but of course it keeps you in that moment. I want to be completely focused on the new season from a specific point. That’s the one thing. When we said we have to get rid of the backpack of the history of the club so we can make a step in the right direction, we have to make sure our own history - even though it’s a very good one - doesn’t keep us in that moment.

Nobody gives you a book that you can read about how to deal with a Champions League win<br /><br /><b>[Klopp insists <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are the favourites to triumph in the Premier League this coming season]</b> Because they’ve won the league twice in a row. That’s one reason. Ours was the first year on that level. We have to prove we can be on that level again. That’s how it is. The 97 points were no coincidence but it’s not like we outplayed all the teams, like we shot them out of the stadium constantly. We needed tied games, close games a lot. We were a real result machine last year, it was really, really impressive. The champions are favourites. They didn’t lose a player - they have lost Kompany, sorry, and brought in another one. I knew they would do something <b>[in the transfer market]</b>. If somebody asks if we’re favourites in the Champions League we probably couldn’t deny it. We don’t think it’s like this, but then we are in the final twice in a row so obviously we know the way to the final. Does that mean we will be in the final again?

  <p><b>[Klopp reveals how he turned <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> into mentality giants]</b> Look, if a player has no talent in football, I can’t make him a great player. But in terms of mentality, I think human beings have it. I think it is in them. The explanation for me is this. How long can I hang on the edge of a mountain with one finger, when I will only save my own life? I have no clue, maybe 10 seconds, maybe a little longer? But if, on the other hand, I have my little boy, and I have to save him, I could hang there for three days - in my imagination, anyway. I’d do it for him, not for myself. The more you realise the different things you do for different people, how valuable it is, the easier it is to go over your limit. These boys have that talent. They would hang on the mountain edge for four years for each other, I have no doubt!<br /><br />Of course, you can learn about mentality. We are not ‘mentality giants’ when we are born. Nobody is. Life makes us what we are. In this case, football and bad experiences can help us a lot. You lose a game and it’s not so nice, but if you use it, it can make sense. If you don’t use it, it’s useless. The little defeats in life, the little defeats in the outside world and in football, they can make you stronger, they can create mentality. And if you then put the different parts together, different people with different stories, it can create one mentality. It’s really nice to be a part of that here<br /><br />When I came in, I said that nobody likes this team, not even the team! That was the truth, but that’s completely different now. It’s development, it’s time, patience that you give the boys. And it’s bringing quality in as well<br /><br />We had only two signings where we thought ‘Right, they absolutely have to be a slam dunk. That was Ali and Virg. The others, they had to develop. They were still kind of projects, where we had to see if they could do it in the Premier League, if they could do it consistently, all that stuff. <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Gini Wijnaldum</a> and <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>, for example, they were relegated and they came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They were easy picks for us, but they were not obvious picks from the outside. We had to work with these players, all of them<br /><br /><b>[Asked to put his finger on why he had ability to connect with his players]</b> I like people. Life is about relationships. Not only with players, but people in general. With players, it’s the same. It all starts with the phrase I used when I first came. I’m the friend of my players, but not the best friend<br /><br />There are always a few ups and a few downs, which is normal. But, in general, it’s about respect. They have to respect me as a human being and as their boss, and I have to respect them. It depends how you look at it. The decisions I make can be always hard or always easy. I cannot really make a mistake when they are all fit, because of the quality of the team. The decision will always be right, and the others have to respect it and accept it. They want to play more often, of course, but they know we have 11 in the line-up and we will need more than 20 over the course of a season. And if you are in a very good shape, you will have a very good chance to play a lot of games. Even if you have a struggle here or a struggle there, you will still have the chance to play games. They appreciate the situation a lot. They look left and right and see world-class players, and that is a good situation to be in!<br /><br />With any relationship, friendship, work colleague, whatever, the proof is always ‘How is it when it’s not going so well?’. And these were the moments when we came closer together. We lost the final, we lost three finals, and the boys were still able to look in each other’s eyes. They like to be around each other, and I like to be around them sometimes too<br /><br /><b>[For a second, just a second, he pauses, lost in his thoughts.

They did well in a lot of moments, we played a lot of good football that we didn’t finish off. We had our chances. There were moments when we wanted a free kick. I don’t understand why there was no free kick when Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> goes down, up and down, up and down. You think ‘what’s happening here?’. It kept the intensity of the game, but what I said, we controlled moments but didn’t have a lot of chances at the end. You saw a lot of respect from both sides where we both defended well, but each ball we lost or they lost was immediately a threat. In these situations, you have to finish it off. I think one situation, Sadio was running, if he makes two more steps and shot, but from the beginning he wanted to pass the ball, in the end you’re like make another step and you can do it yourself. We made these decisions that were not right tonight and we have to accept the result<br /><br />It should hurt because there were opportunities to win the game. This was a much better game than the last time we played them and they won 1-0 in the last minute. It was an open game.

We were running, they were running and that killed everyone on the pitch. Then we started controlling it again but conceded a penalty. That doesn’t help. I don’t think it’s a penalty.

We experienced that you don’t have to be the best team in the world to win the Champions League.

It’s not a physical problem tonight. We have to finish the situations off. How everybody is in life, you need positive moments and you can run forever. We didn’t have really positive moments tonight.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has overseen some of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s most productive transfer business of the modern era and admits that his recruitment philosophy is to seek out world-class potential]</b> In football, there are two ways to improve. One is to sign good players and the second is training, but having time together is always good. We don’t start at minus 20 and say ‘by the way, set-piece, we do this, we do that’ and you have to explain to six players and you think ‘oh God!’. Having a basis is brilliant, but you need world-class players and if they are not world-class already, they need the world-class potential. That is what we need at a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I think that is what we tried to do and it I think it worked pretty well. All the boys have improved a lot since we were together and that is what you have to do. So whatever we achieved, we did it because the boys always took the next steps, got more mature, got more confident and more convinced about the way we play. I think meanwhile, it becomes really natural for the boys and that is so important. For us, our big target was to qualify for the Champions League and it was clear we wanted to do that. But it’s the most difficult league to do this in, in England, but it happened somehow<br /><br />I didn’t look at it as having to change a lot. OK, it was clear that something is not going exactly how the people want it to go. I said it before and it is pretty much a famous phrase, nobody likes this team, not even the team likes the team, so that was something we had to change first and foremost. We have to feel the value they have, that they are in the right place and the right club and the history of the club doesn’t feel too much on their shoulders and all these things, so, those were the things we had to change immediately</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has revealed an embarrassing moment in which he gave a Rocky-themed speech to his <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players ahead of a clash with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> My <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> team were playing <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. It was a huge match in the league. We hadn’t won in Munich in something like 20 years. I take a lot of inspiration from movies, so whenever I needed to motivate the boys I would always think of Rocky Balboa. In my opinion, they should show Rocky 1, 2, 3 and 4 in public schools all across the world. It should be like learning the alphabet. If you watch these movies and you don’t want to climb to the top of a mountain, then I think something is wrong with you.<br /><br />So the night before we played <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, I gathered all my players at the hotel for our team talk. I told them the truth of the situation: ‘The last time <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> won in Munich, most of you were still in your Pampers.’ Then I started playing some scenes from Rocky IV on the screen. The one with Ivan Drago. A classic, in my opinion. Drago is running on the treadmill, and he’s hooked up to the big computer monitors and the scientists are studying him. I told the boys, ‘You see? <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> is Ivan Drago. The best of everything! The best technology! The best machines! He’s unstoppable!’ Then you see Rocky training in Siberia in his little log cabin. He’s chopping down pine trees and carrying logs through the snow and running up to the top of the mountain.<br /><br />I told the boys, ‘You see? That’s us. We are Rocky. We are smaller, yes. But we have the passion! We have the heart of a champion! We can do the impossible!’ I was going on and on, and then at some point, I look out to all my boys to see their reaction. I was expecting them to be standing up on their chairs, ready to go run up a mountain in Siberia, going absolutely crazy. But everyone is just sitting there, staring at me with dead eyes. Completely blank. They’re looking at me like, ‘What in the world is this crazy man talking about?’ So then I realised, ‘Wait, when did Rocky IV come out, 1980-something? When were these boys born?’ Finally, I said, ‘Wait a minute, boys. Please raise your hand if you know who Rocky Balboa is?’ Only two hands went up.<br /><br />Everyone else, ‘Nope, sorry, boss.’ My entire speech - nonsense! This is the most important match of the season. Maybe the most important match of some of the players’ lives. And the manager has been screaming about Soviet technology and Siberia for the last 10 minutes! Can you believe this? I had to start my whole speech over from scratch. You see, this is the real story. This is what actually happens in life. We are human beings. Sometimes, we embarrass ourselves. That’s how it is. We think we’re giving the greatest speech in the history of football, and we’re actually talking complete nonsense. But we get up the next morning and we go again. Do you know the strangest part of that story? I honestly cannot be sure if we won or lost the match. I am pretty sure that I gave this speech in 2011 before we won 3-1, and that certainly makes for a much better story! But I can’t be 100% sure. This is one thing about football that people don’t always understand. The results, you forget. You get them all mixed up</p>

I loved the fact I got a sensational assistant manager, but we lost the development coach a little bit.<br /><br />We had to fill that void and we’ve done that with a really great guy, an outstanding coach. Young and experienced, you don’t get that a lot. A kind of guy who is used to having six or seven sessions a day. He is smart, his English is very good - which is obviously important - and he has worked at different clubs, but is educated at Porto, which is good for us because Pep is from there as well. He had made his own experience already and now we can all get the benefit of that. It will be great for the boys 100 per cent. We have to introduce him to the boys, but he will do that today</p>

In Milton Keynes, <a href="caoimhin-kelleher.html">Caoimhin Kelleher</a>, Ki-Jana Hoever, <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a>, <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> and <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> all started and equipped themselves superbly. Herbie Kane, <a href="pedro-chirivella.html">Pedro Chirivella</a> and <a href="sepp-van-den-berg.html">Sepp van den Berg</a> all came on off the bench. The attitude these players showed in the last round is exactly what will be required this evening, if again given the opportunity.<br /><br />They show the right attitude and the perfect amount of hunger each and every day they train with us at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>. They show us, in their actions, that they understand what an immense privilege it is to represent a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - it’s an honour all of us blessed to work here feel. Clearly the ability of these players is not in question. It is their talent that has brought them here and kept them here. At this stage of their careers it is about a variety of other factors - and being ready to grasp an opportunity is a big part of it.<br /><br />It is appropriate to point to <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> when discussing this. This month three years ago he made his first-team debut. Against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at the weekend he made his 99th appearance for the senior side. The reason he has achieved this in such a short space of time, one of the four youngest in LFC history I believe, isn’t just because he has amazing ability. It is because of how he has handled himself, taken his chances and dealt with setbacks and difficulties. There won’t be a player in our current first-team squad who hasn’t faced these challenges at a young age. It is the job of all us to help them and nurture them and give them an environment to grow, develop and flourish. I am confident we are doing this</p>

We must be in the moment. We saw just how tight the group was last season. The very last kick of the very last group game could have put us out. If you, for even half a second, lose sight of how hard this competition is and how precious each and every point is, trust me, we will not have the experiences like we enjoyed the last couple of seasons.<br /><br />A Champions League game, be it group or knockout, is a heavyweight world title fight every time. Every team you face has the quality to beat you and to knock you to the canvas. These teams don’t just have a puncher’s chance, they are winners with a winner’s approach. If you have the wrong attitude or the wrong mindset you will lose. There is no question of this. I’m not particularly interested what happens elsewhere in the other groups but I am pretty sure it is the same in all of them. The final answer for group standings will almost certainly go to the last game again.<br /><br />I have no worries about our approach because I know this team and this club is streetwise enough to know what is needed. We have that institutional knowledge ingrained in us that a Champions League night, be it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> or away, is an occasion to relish and respect. As a club we don’t take these nights for granted and that must show in our performance. And by ‘our performance’ I mean all of us. Players, management, staff and supporters. We all come here and show our best face. Genk absolutely will - so if we don’t, we risk our future in a competition we are in love with.

How long it will take <b>[to recover]</b>, we’re not sure 100 per cent but it looks pretty sure he will not be involved in the Christmas fixtures. We have solutions for the position. We can replace him. We’ve played good without him, but now it’s important to get him doing the right things and get him back as soon as possible. Until then, we have to find solutions. We’re not the only team with injured players. It’s what we have to deal with now and we will.<br /><br />We watched the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> game from last year and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> played the position, Gini played the position already, <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> played the position, we can change system … Losing a player of the quality of <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> is massive, really bad, but we are not the only team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with injuries.

We just have to make it work. Fab couldn’t have played all the games from now until March. It’s not cool, but we’re in contact with him. We think a lot about it - not in the case of ‘oh my God, how can we deal with it?’ - just in the case of ‘let’s do the right thing for Fab, let’s do the right thing for the team<br /><br />It’s not too long ago we spoke about how we rely so much on our front three. I couldn’t care less who scores - I’m really happy when the ball is in the net. Of course, it’s good, but I still think we could have scored more goals, to be honest. It makes us a bit more unpredictable but it’s nothing I really think about. What I think about at the moment is we play Brighton, with a very, very exciting development. Graham <b>[Potter]</b> is doing a really good job. That’s our issue, not who scores. After that game, pretty much everybody has this kind of three games a week coming up now.

Without that we have no chance to fulfil the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> dreams. You need a strong character and this team has a strong character</p>

I am blessed to be surrounded by so many amazing staff; honestly, I feel the luckiest manager in the world in this regard. Peter and Pep have contributed just as much as I have to the development of this team and although as the manager, many may see me as the face of the club, their input and expertise is invaluable to what we’re looking to achieve.<br /><br />I have worked with Pete for many years now, going back to my time at Mainz and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. And even now I am still amazed at the things he spots during a game. He has an incredible talent and one that is priceless for us. It has been one of the best professional experiences for me to see him grow and become the coach he now is. He’s always been essential to me, but his own personal development since arriving at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has been outstanding. He is so smart, so insightful and so important to us.<br /><br />Pep, what can I say? What this guy doesn’t know about football isn’t worth knowing! I have never met a guy more passionate and dedicated about the game. I only got to know him when I first arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but I instantly fell in love with his infectious commitment and knowledge of the game. He left for a period and came back - but he came back in a more senior capacity and he’s flourished since. He is every inch a top manager of the future, but in the meantime, I am thankful we have him with us. But going beyond Pete and Pep, these new deals are a mark of not only our collective belief in our project, but also a sign of our development so far.<br /><br />We always say it is a collective effort at Melwood; it’s not just about me, the players or my coaching team, everybody who works here contributes in their own way to what happens on the field and how we have progressed as a club - that’s why we have everybody’s names on a wall in a corridor here. We all share the same vision and we all share the same belief in the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> continues to move forward.

  <p><b>[Angry Klopp hammers <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> in lengthy rant on AFCON scheduling]</b> You really want to open this book now? So, I couldn’t respect the African Cup of Nations more than I do because I like the competition. I watched it a lot in the past in my life, very interesting tournament, most difficult circumstances a lot of times and the players, what they make of it, sensational players. It’s not the last time you see the players as they turn up in Europe, they turn up everywhere. But it is an obvious problem that you play a tournament in the middle of the season, although it makes more sense for Africa to play it in our winter when the weather is better for them - I get that. The only problem is it’s a general problem.<br /><br />A couple of things which are not okay: one thing is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> plans a tournament in the summer of 2021 <b>[the Club World Cup]</b>, a week later the actual African Cup of Nations would have started I think, or maybe two weeks later, another tournament for a lot of world-class players. I mentioned that in the past. I am not sure if that was part of the decision when they thought ‘okay, it makes no sense to play it after that tournament, it makes sense to play it in the winter’, or was the weather the real <b>[reason]</b>. It means another tournament, it’s too many tournaments still. That’s one thing.<br /><br />The other thing is it doesn’t help African players. We will not sell Sadio, Mo or Naby now because they have a tournament in January and February - of course not - but if you have to make a decision about bringing in a player it is a massive one because before the season you know for four weeks you don’t have them. That’s a normal process and as a club you have to think about these things. It doesn’t help the players, for sure. But these decisions are made without asking the players, without asking the managers, without asking anyone. It is just a decision.<br /><br />It is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> who should sort all of that as head of all the different associations. It doesn’t look like being involved, they are still happy having their 21-team World Cup offering a lot of money, I don’t know the exact numbers but it must be a lot of money for all the clubs involved. But I don’t think it is just one problem for this country: European Championships, world championships, it’s like no-one can live without that, it’s a natural right to have this but we forget these tournaments are played by players, they don’t have a break.<br /><br />I feel massively for <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, I now hear he may not be in the Euros. For the first time some English people in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> may think ‘Oh, too many games maybe’. Something has to happen for them to really start thinking about it. Now they send all these guys in winter again, in the middle of a season to a tournament in different circumstances, and coming back from the African Cup of Nations is not easy to take. But the welfare of the players no-one thinks about. These are really important things.<br /><br />The African Cup of Nations going back to January is, for us, a catastrophe. On top of that we have absolutely no power, so if we did say: ‘We don’t let him go’ the player is suspended. How is that possible that the company who pays the player cannot decide if the player has to stay or not. If you would say: ‘Let’s play the African Cup of Nations but the players play in other countries, not in Africa’, it still would be a great tournament but not <b>[involving]</b> the superstars, the superstars of tomorrow. I don’t say that would be a solution for it but it’s strange we have absolutely no say.<br /><br />If a player is injured and cannot play for us we have to send him to Africa and they have a look and in one or two weeks they are back. We just sit there and plan the route, the flight for the boys, and say ‘There you go, have the boys’. Nowadays it should not be like this. But I speak here about it and no-one will listen. It is like the biggest waste of time ever. The moaner from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or whatever is again on track. As long as nothing changes I will say it all the time. It is because it is about the players, not one second about me. There are so many things to sort but all these guys never find time to sit around one table and make a general schedule. All these different games to play and no break for the players. Let’s respect that, but if you have that break don’t make a replay in this break. This would help massively</p>

Hopefully, the pitch will be OK - I have no idea so far about any circumstances. That is proper cup and I like that. Is it a test? Yes, maybe, but it is not like I test the players, it is a test in general as you play against a team who fights the fight of their life and we have to show how important the next round is to us</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> taking coronavirus seriously but yet to reassess pre-season plans]</b> Not yet, over pre-season we’ve not thought of changes yet. The biomedical department, all advice we get from there. But if you <b>[the media]</b> come in here and don’t shake hands, I’m now only two metres away from you, so whatever you have I probably can’t avoid getting it as well. We had an interview outside and were even closer. We take it really serious, but you can’t avoid everything. It’s not a football problem, it’s a society problem, what we all have in common, so I think everybody is thinking about it at the moment<br /><br />Hopefully the people who are much smarter than us find a way to <b>[end the illness]</b>, or medicine, as that’s obviously the big problem at the moment, we don’t have that yet. Hopefully it will settle, but at the moment we deal like all other people, take it seriously and maybe don’t do things like maybe you would usually do, but it’s like when flu is going around<br /><br />For us it’s the same, we can’t do anything different to that and I think in the moment everyone takes it serious. We’ve not told anyone not to shake hands, but then we haven’t said you have to shake hands. We have all these disinfection places where we can wash our hands, but is that enough? We don’t know. No one has told us that we can’t play football, and as long as that doesn’t happen we will play football. It’s important we take it seriously but not get crazy, because there are other areas in the world where it’s more difficult and hopefully we find a really quick solution</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp looked on the bright side of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first defeat in 44 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches]</b> We were going to lose a game at some time, and we didn’t wait for it but it was clear it would happen. Tonight it happened and I see it rather positive that we got close to these records. Now we can play free football again and don’t have to try to get a record. We just have to try to win football games again, and that’s what we will do. I am not celebrating a 44-game run. Some people have said other numbers, and I’m not sure which is the right one because I don’t care who is right. I don’t know, I’m not interested<br /><br />But I know things like this are really difficult, because the boys have to be absolutely everything. Tiredness wasn’t a problem, no. Shape isn’t something you can take for granted, form isn’t something you can take for granted.<br /><br />Why do we have the amount of points we have? Because we fought against each little feeling in the body when it was like this or that or our concentration level looked like it would drop, against misfortune, everything. That’s why we have the amount of points we have.<br /><br />Other teams did the same but couldn’t get the same amount of points because it’s so difficult. It’s not easy to explain why tonight it didn’t happen for us, but it shouldn’t be the biggest sensation in world football. We lost that battle. What can I say now, that it’s not acceptable? It’s not that we don’t think it’s important because we won so many games, but we don’t think it’s the biggest catastrophe in the world of football<br /><br />To beat the best club side in the world at the moment is testament to how we played. So, it’s very satisfying, but it’s just one game. We’ve got 10 games left and they’re all going to be very important. We’ve got to try to emulate what we’ve done today in terms of performance. I’m really proud of the players and they should be really proud of how they’ve coped with a difficult situation. In the context of our season, it’s a really important three points. We knew we would have to be at our best today, and I think we were.</p>

You have to accept it, it’s not so easy, but it’s the proof we were not good enough tonight. It’s always very difficult. We have to accept if after. In the game you have to fight.

  <p><b>[Klopp regrets celebrating in front of linesman amid VAR frustration]</b> To be honest, yes, that happened. Would I do it now? No. But in this moment I just don’t understand how this could be a goal. There are situations, we talk about it, stuff like this, but now we have to make a decision. This shows the problem of VAR still existing. It’s not a VAR, it’s not a system, it’s a human being and the rules. It was a foul. The touch was enough to let Joe struggle - it was a foul, nothing else. They score a goal in the next situation, the ref lets it run, that’s why we have VAR, so we can have a look later. Two or three weeks ago, the VAR made really difficult decisions on one matchday in two different games - I think with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <b>[Manchester]</b> City, I’m not quite sure. But <b>[I was]</b> like, ‘Wow, how is that possible that someone sits there and doesn’t see it?’ So now, for me, the question is how is it possible you have a look at it and don’t say, ‘Ah, it’s a foul’. Mike Dean <b>[the fourth official]</b> I’m sure saw it was a foul, but it’s not his job, he cannot intervene anymore, so it’s then VAR. And the VAR hides behind the phrase ‘not clear and obvious’. It makes no sense<br /><br />A foul is a foul, no foul is no foul, you can let it go, whatever, it’s no problem. But if it’s that clear and you look at it and say, ‘Come on, play on’, nobody felt comfortable after that. Not the ref, everybody knew something happened here which is not okay. That is easy to sort with someone sitting in the room in front of a screen says, ‘Yeah, come on, foul’. That’s it. I understand 100 per cent Bournemouth maybe sees it different, but it’s a clear, clear foul. Arms like this, it’s not possible in that situation. So I celebrated a little bit in their direction. I’m not happy about it but it happened and I didn’t say anything while I was celebrating</p>

The second goal was a bigger problem. After the second goal the legs were a bit tired. Everything that looked really natural in the first 90 minutes became a bit stiff.

  <p><b>[Klopp reveals what he’s been doing during coronavirus lockdown]</b> I didn’t cut the grass but I tried the dance of Ox! Not as bad as you probably think! It’s very important in these times that we all show we take this situation seriously, but we are human beings. At the moment we are at home and when you are at home, you cannot do something to help outside. We are not health workers, we don’t work in a supermarket. You have to keep your own mood up and you have to keep the mood up for other people. If the boys do anything on Instagram, as long as it’s in a legal frame I’m overly happy about it - it just shows they are still cheeky and all that stuff. I like it, I like it a lot. I like the line-ups they do. All these things are really funny. It’s good. I watched a few movies - I watched the Taken trilogy again! To be honest, that’s how it is - you do a lot of things you usually don’t do. I’m still in that period. Two weeks is long but it’s not that long<br /><br />We said it now often enough, and I think everybody knows, football is not the most important thing in the world. One hundred per cent not. In this moment it’s clear what is. But the only way to get football back as soon as possible, if that’s what the people want, the more disciplined we are now the earlier we will get, piece by piece by piece, our life back. That’s how it is. There is no other solution in the moment, nobody has another solution.<br /><br />We have to be disciplined by ourselves, we have to keep the distance to other people. We can still do some things, not a lot, but we have to just calm down a little bit with things. Yes, outside the economy has to carry on, that will start again. But the lower the number will be when we go out again, the number of people infected, that’s what I understand, the better it is. It will not be like nobody anymore after the next few weeks but the curve will flatten, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />We have to give our people in the hospitals, our doctors, the chance to treat the people with serious issues with full concentration. We have to give people time to build ventilators, we have to give people time to find solutions. There will be a moment when other smart people find a vaccine for the virus. But until then, we have to make sure we do the best possible for all the people out there. You hear now more and more it’s not only the elderly and weaker - it’s not only that, there are younger people involved who can die of it as well. It’s not about that, it’s about just, show heart and a bit of sensibility and do the right thing: stay at home as long as we have to. And then at one point we will play football again as well, 100 per cent. I couldn’t wish more for it because of a few really good reasons, how you can imagine. I can’t wait actually, but even I have to be disciplined and I try to be as much as I can</p>

These are the closest moments, apart from exchanging messages with them and asking, ‘How are you?’ and stuff like this. So I enjoy these sessions really a lot. It’s getting worse, the longer it takes. I accept the situation 100 per cent like it is but the longer you don’t see somebody you like, the more it hurts. That’s the situation we are in at the moment</p>

If we will be successful depends on what other clubs are doing as well because they all have a chance to improve things, to do things better. So I have no clue what the future will hold for us.

There are a lot of things we can improve obviously, but we can improve it with this team, which is really great<br /><br />Life is a constant challenge and we realise it in this moment especially because we never faced a challenge like the one we have now. It looks like the situations we had in the past where we thought they are big problems, they look like nothing. Qualifying again for a Champions League final and not winning the league because of a point or 11mm, that could be hard. But we always saw it like this: the only way to get something is to give everything. But it’s not a guarantee. The boys were always ready to give their all, absolutely all and try again and try again and try again. Then there are two possible scenarios. One is you lose the final, one is you win the final. You lose the final, there is still a wonderful experience to go there because you had to qualify from the semi-finals, the quarter-finals, the last 16, you have to go through the group stage. You can take so much confidence from it and that’s what we did from the Champions League defeat against Madrid. It was a strange final and it said nothing about the boys, absolutely nothing. The only thing we realised was we were good enough to cause a few more teams problems now. That was exactly the plan for the next season. In this season we are at the end of April and it didn’t start again, that’s clear, but whenever we can play again - whenever it will be - we will not give up. In the moment when it’s allowed to concentrate on football again for us, we will do that again and we will start with that again and try our best again. We will see when it will be</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp gives insight into his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team selections]</b> The players know a day or two before the game if they play or not. I want them to prepare for it, but I treat them individually. If a player who has played the last 20 games in a row is not playing the next game it’s not a big problem. I have to judge the situation always in the moment. We had situations like in the Champions League last year, second leg when everybody told me that <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> was really angry that he didn’t start. I tell the boys you don’t have to be happy with my decisions, you just have to accept them and after the game, we can speak about it. But before the game, we cannot. If you are in a session and you’re not happy but you train well, come after the game in my office on Monday morning and I can explain it. If you would say I am a friend of players, believe me, come matchday I am the friend of exactly 11 players. All the others have some things to criticise if you would ask them<br /><br />My players aren’t my sons but my sons are now turning 35 and 32, and that’s pretty much exactly the same. There are moments when you are a father, there are moments when you are a friend, there are moments when you have to criticise them. These things are always exactly the same. I always did that with my players as well. We can have a really close relationship and the closer relationship you get, the more you have to tell the truth to the boys because they judge you on that. I explained it once and said I really want to be the friend of my players but I cannot be their best friend. That’s how it is. A friend has to tell you the truth, a friend has to tell you what you can do better, a friend has to - and will - always tell you what is right and what is wrong. That’s exactly what I do, but never in a manner that they cannot get up the next morning. It’s always the same reason: I want to help them. I have no other job. My job is to help the boys to be the best player they can be, and there are a few things to do</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp feared he’d get sacked by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> if he didn’t improve them quickly enough]</b> It was clear we needed time. It was clear we couldn’t fix it overnight. Everybody wanted that but it was clear <b>[it couldn’t be done straight away]</b>. So I had to ask for time, that’s how it is. Before in my career I had never got the sack so I had no real experience with that. But I knew now I’m on a different level <b>[at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> and if I cannot deliver here quick enough then I’m going to get the sack, as easy as that. That’s why I said if I sit here in four years still then something happened (Liverpool improving and winning trophies) probably in between now and then. It’s not that I asked for four years, I asked for a little bit of time. We got that. The nice thing was that after seven or eight games … they (Liverpool’s owners) were really positive about the situation of signing me and that it would be the right one, together with my coaches. They realised ‘okay, yes, they’re on the right path’ and from that moment on they didn’t question it for one second. They were full of faith and trust and said ‘this is the path we’ll stay on and everything will be fine’. Who knows if you can win something in that difficult league but we’ll try this way. But we never really thought about losing finals when we lost them like against <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, City or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Pundits said ‘if he doesn’t win the next one then they have to change something’. That’s how it is. Internally nobody thought like this<br /><br />Some ideas were always the same, the organisation - or the idea about organisation - was similar, where I wanted my teams to win the ball back and stuff like this. These things never really change because I just think they are right, but of course as a manager you have to adapt your style to the quality of the players you have available. The quality increased a lot in the last few years, not only here; at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> it was already different to Mainz. At Mainz it was different from year to year. But it’s all about the organisation. It’s not that I have a fixed idea of how it should be and then I try to push it through with the boys, it’s just I try to understand exactly the quality and skills of the boys and then to use that. Because the pitch in all my career was always the same size and the rules didn’t change too much since I was a manager. So these things are clear, so you have to try to adapt to different situations. Of course, a lot of things changed. The way I work changed; I started alone, now I have a lot of coaches next to me. That’s all different to how it was</p>

It was like becoming a champion in the A-Class Northwest. It was a really great celebration with all the zipping and zapping. There would be no such thing today. I was heavily drunk in 2011, but in 2012, after the double, I didn’t really notice <b>[the celebrations]</b>. You can see what alcohol does to people. Do not drink, otherwise, you will lose the memory of important moments in your life<br /><br />It’s right up there.

Quite a lot has happened in my life, but it’s not the case that I’ve won so much that I get it all mixed up. But 2011 and 12 aren’t so easy because the team didn’t change that much and when I was thinking about the games we played I was trying to remember: was that 2010-11 or 11-12? But I’ve got nothing but great memories and it probably had a huge impact on my career as a coach. We really made the most of what we had. Winning promotion with Mainz was unexpected for all of us and I didn’t know what would happen next, that was such a big thing. But to take these Under-19s to the German title - I felt like they were U-19s - was amazing. It changed our lives and thinking about it now, I’m still in touch with practically all of them<br /><br /><b>[The news that Cologne had taken the lead sent Signal Iduna Park into raptures as <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> sat on the verge of glory, but footage of Klopp shows that he did not drop his trademark hyperactive intensity on the sidelines even then, although he admits he felt deep down the job was complete]</b> Well, I am a coach. I wasn’t able to open the beers when it was 2-0!. It wasn’t over, even though my inner feeling was ‘this is it’, the game was still going. That often happens as a coach, and it’s your job. You have to give orders, shout, think about tactics and so on. Even at times like that, you have to rant and rave at the players. We wanted to win the game - it wasn’t about getting across the line however we could, it was about crossing it in the best way possible. That will be why I was still in match mode.

When Divock scored the goal, I knew on the night that it was enough so we would win. That was my biggest memory. It was job done, and I really loved it.<br /><br />I know that it was one of the greatest nights of my life, I said it after the game as well.

I felt directly for <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager]</b> Mauricio <b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>]</b>, went to him, gave him a hug and it’s like a strange situation where you are in between being really happy and really feeling for another person. Because I knew exactly that day how he felt. But after that, the next few days were some of the best of my life, 100 per cent. Because it’s so big, it’s so massive. I tried it with different teams so often and I knew as a human being reaching a final is big but without winning it’s not the same, and it was a while ago that I felt I needed the full package by being in the final and winning the final so it was a very, very special moment.<br /><br /><b>[Klopp was quick to savour the moment with his family]</b> I’ve forgot the number already but I think I lost five or six finals before that so you can imagine.

Why would you think always about something you cannot have in the moment? Use the thing you have in the moment. It looks like it will be possible - and it is in Germany already possible - to play behind closed doors. And the football games were really good; super goals, real fight, tight games, clear games, clear results, a proper fight. Imagine, the first night is a little bit like, ‘Have a look here and there, how will it work, how does it feel?’, but in Germany so many teams play for pretty much everything - they want to stay in the league - and that’s exactly the same what will happen in England.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager Klopp expects <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return to be ‘intense’ as he backs decision to resume training]</b> I was over the moon, I would say. I couldn’t wait for a while now, so I am really happy that we are able to do this again - going back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>, having small group training and stuff like this. It will be intense, for the coaches especially because a lot of players in small groups means a lot of sessions, but we’ve had enough time to rest so we will be fine. Can’t wait<br /><br />When we start, it goes really again for everything. The competition will make the intensity. So, it’s not about, ‘Oh, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to win two games’. By the way, we have to win two games when we start - it’s not ‘only two’, it’s two. It’s not less or more. We have to win them, it’s not that we want to win the last two or whatever and come through somehow. We want to play the best possible football, better than other teams fighting for the Champions League, fighting to stay in the league. We have to do it, unfortunately, without the best boost in the world and the best kick in your ass in the right moment in the world, from the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> crowd. That’s how it is. I never understood in life why you always want things you don’t have, you cannot have. In this moment we cannot have that, so let’s take the rest and make the absolute best of it<br /><br />Nobody wants to bring anybody into danger, but I think with all the things we know about, sticking to the social distancing rule - especially in the first part - with testing as often as possible and stuff like this, the players will be safe. Germany showed it already - a couple of players had a positive test during the long period, they trained for five weeks and now they play already, stuff like this and they had altogether 10 or 12 positive tests. I hope that we are now in England on the right side of the thing as well. It’s all about when - but you need to re-open step by step different parts of life again. Everybody agrees about that, it’s only about when. It’s now a good moment to do it. Then other things, for sure, will follow</p>

I said before the session, ‘You are here on free will. Usually you sign a contract and you have to be in when I tell you, but in this case if you don’t feel safe, you don’t have to be here’. There are no restrictions, no punishment, nothing. It’s their own decision and we respect that 100 per cent. The boys are fine. We would never put anybody in danger to do what we want to do. Yes, we love football, yes, it’s our job, but it’s not more important than our lives or the lives of other people<br /><br />Brilliant, I really enjoyed it. The weather is fantastic, and the boys are in good spirits. This morning we had to come already changed so I felt a bit like a policeman in my uniform - finally, for the right reasons again. That felt pretty special. Then coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and seeing all the boys was nice. Before the session we had to give an introduction to make sure everything went in line. It was a short meeting and then a little bit more about the targets and then we started training. That was the best part for a while, really good. The first 10 players were here, we have groups of five that train at the same time on different pitches obviously, far away from each other. It looked like football and that is what we want to do. For the boys, they had the longest break ever, around nine weeks. The international players usually have around two weeks in the summer, so we need to get used to a lot of things again. But the first impression was really positive</p>

I like when you see the soul or character of the coach in the team. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> again: you see a team and think: ‘Wow, that’s either <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> or somebody who worked with him.’ But you can never be exactly the same. Dressing is one part of our character. Wear what you want, but don’t make it the most important thing. In the end the game is what counts.

The more important information for me was how good we can be; if we are really concentrated, if we are really focused, and if we improve a couple of things we can get even better. That was our motivation, using the last season as a basis, not as a sign how close it can be and how much it can hurt <b>[losing the title]</b>.

If you are a really good football team then you have to win football games, so now it’s about us to decide how many football games we will win. We really take it game by game.

We try it with increasing intensity, day by day, but we have to be fit on the 19th or 20th, whichever day they will give us against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I think. That’s the moment when we want to be at 100 per cent. It’s roundabout three weeks until then, that’s good. We want to use that and we will. It’s our pre-season; how I said, we don’t expect a long break in between the seasons, so this is a very important period for us. We never had nine weeks without football training in our lives - since we played football, pretty much. That’s all different but interesting as well. We enjoy the situation, that’s really all good. It makes all the difference for us, to be honest, to come together and have this hour or two here together. You get this contact, feedback as well on the pitch directly, not via a computer or a screen. It’s a massive, massive lift.<br /><br />It’s <b>[been]</b> a massive organisational challenge, to be honest. What (first-team operations manager) Ray Haughan did in that department is unbelievable - where we can park, where we can walk and all that stuff. When you make the step from 10 players of two groups of five, to nearly 30, that’s massive. We still have to stick to the same things. So, we are fully concentrated when we come in here, let me say it like this; that we do the right things, that we get the temperature tested and all these things. It’s not like it usually is. It’s completely fine but it’s just when you come here it’s not like, ‘Yippee!’ - you think, ‘Where do I have to drive, where is somebody who gets my temperature?’ and all that stuff. That’s how it is in the moment. The boys are still the same really good bunch of boys, and that helps a lot. We are in a good moment, we enjoy it. Hopefully we can make progress in the next two or three weeks, there are a lot of things that need to be organised still, obviously. We need to get hopefully a couple of <b>[bits of]</b> information but we take it like it is and use each second we are together<br /><br />That’s what we were all waiting for. But now it’s always like this. You were waiting for that, somebody tells us we could start, that’s good. Now we know, from a training point of view, what we have to do when and when we have to be at 100 per cent in the best way, how we can train in different intensities. That was very important. Now, of course, it’s more and more interesting when we play where, the times are really important because we will see how we can organise the travel stuff. So, the situation keeps us busy, that’s absolutely OK, but on the pitch everything is fine, that’s really great. Around, we organise it as good as possible and use the situation</p>

What I can say - and want to say - now is even the way he has handled this extension tells you all you need to know about the person and his character. A top-class professional and an even better person. Adam always puts the club first - always! In the conversations we have had, he has been the first to express that my priority as a manager needs to be the players who are at this club for longer than just the rest of this season. He wants to be here to finish the job and do it properly, but it says everything about him that his biggest concern was blocking the progress and opportunity of a player who is under contract for next season also. But his role is too important to lose him before this season is done. So, it’s fantastic we can delay our messages of gratitude and good luck until the end of July now.<br /><br />Now isn’t the moment to review my time here because the focus needs to be on the remaining nine matches and the club finishing the season in the best manner possible. Of course, one of the big personal positives about committing to this short-term extension is that I will now get to say goodbye to the people who mean so much to me in the right way. The gaffer has been different class and we’ve had an honest conversation about what my role will be in the remaining weeks. I want to contribute in the most positive way possible that helps him and the team, not just for the remaining matches of this season - but also what they’ll need to consider for next. I’m totally at peace with what that looks and feels like, and I know the role I’ll be playing for this team will help in what’s going to be an extraordinary period - the likes of which none of us have ever experienced. I feel in my time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> I’ve always looked to do the right thing for the team, the manager and the club in every decision I’ve made.

That’s ok. It looked really good, obviously. It looked really good, pretty much from the beginning. Yes, you have to get used again to playing against a deep-defending side and stuff like this. <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> had a playing build-up from time to time, so we could work on the high press as well. So <b>[the]</b> counter-press was brilliant, the football was really good, the goals were nice and it was a really good afternoon. I am really thankful that <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> came here and we could do that, so I wish them all the best</p>

That’s the truth.<br /><br />When I see the numbers here in ­England and then in Germany, I think. Look, it’s not perfect in Germany, people have died and have been ill. But, in terms of living your life, it is completely different. If you want to enter a shop in Germany, but don’t wear a face mask, then you aren’t allowed in. With a face mask, you can go in all the shops you want. You can go to the hairdresser, wherever. They wear a face mask, you wear a face mask, and sometimes the people in the shop will have even more ­protection like a screen. When I go to the petrol ­station in England, I am the only one wearing a face mask and I’m the only one with gloves - I feel like an alien.

We were lucky in that moment but apart from that, we were in control. We didn’t have a lot of chances; most of the time we were dominant but they had the biggest chance - that’s how it is. It was a real fight. Both teams showed that they understand it’s a derby - even without a crowd. It was intense, physical, all-in. You saw the derbies we had here before - they were never really better, I have to say! Each team is fighting like crazy so in the end there is not a lot of football. There is space for improvement for us here at Goodison; I like football when it’s slightly different but that’s how it is; we had a proper fight, it was intense and we were ready for that. The players were really in the game, so that’s good. I really liked our defending.; the high press, midfield press, counter-press good. We won a lot of balls<br /><br />Of course we want to make more chances; we have to more clear in situations - pass the ball, shoot in the right moment, more crosses.

The boys are in good age group, more experienced, more confident, more convinced and we should use that as much as we can but we know there are other teams out there who will do the exactly the same to improve their situation and there will be hard fights but that is how <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is, a hard fight every three days. We have seven days off before <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and then we play six of the seven remaining games in 18 days or so, so there is not a lot of time to think, only about the game we play and then the next game. That will be pretty intense.</p>

How we watched the game tonight together, we knew it could happen, it couldn’t not happen, we didn’t know. We want to play football and we are really happy that we are allowed to play again - then when it happened in that moment, it was a pure explosion. When we counted down the last five seconds of the game, the ref counted down a little bit longer than us so we had to look at two or three more passes! Then it was pure…I cannot describe it. It was a really, really nice moment. Directly after it, I felt so empty inside - I cannot believe it, I am really not happy with myself in the moment that I feel like I feel, but it’s just a little bit too much in the moment. I will be fine, nobody has to worry<br /><br />I actually couldn’t be happier; I couldn’t have dreamed of something like that and I never did before last year, honestly. We were not close enough three years ago, a year ago we were really close … what the boys have done in the last two-and-a-half years, the consistency they show is absolutely incredible and second to none. Honestly, I have no idea how we do that all the time. Last night, a very good example - we played a game like the stadium is fully packed and everybody is shouting ‘Liverpool’ or whatever constantly. It is a wonderful moment, that’s what I can say</p>

We had a Facetime call. I told them I loved them, they told me they loved me. We cannot be together, that was not nice, but that’s how it is. Then I put the phone on the table and said ‘leave it on, because in four or five seconds something special will happen’. That was a really nice moment, which I enjoyed a lot. All the other messages, I don’t want to compare at the moment. They were great, all full of appreciation, respect, love, support, whatever.

It gave us time to achieve the things we achieved in the past two-and-a-half, three years<br /><br />The people wanted to have their own history, like the players had to write their own history and stories. They were ready not to compare us too much with all these great, great figures in our club. They gave us time and we used the time pretty well<br /><br />It’s normal that people are positive about the manager of the team when you become champions, but the people know as well, like I know, how much it means to us and how important my coaches are<br /><br />Without Pep, Peter, Vitor, John, Jack, Korny, Mona, Ray, Matt, Danielle, Julia and all the others, it would not be possible, and that’s the truth.

You have to change each year, bring new things, that’s how it is. A season is really long, you need to be lucky in some moments, especially with injuries, so you can never be sure. I was never sure it will happen, but I knew we will become a really good football team. But others are pretty good as well. The consistency makes all the difference. We were good four years ago, we were really good three years, we were unbelievably good last year, the consistency we showed was incredible, and then smashing the record so far this season is absolutely exceptional, and second to none. It’s all about the boys’ commitment, desire and understanding of the club’s heart and soul. That made it happen, and thankfully I am part of this</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp’s bold <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> promise after title win]</b> The last 13 months were pretty special for us, it’s true. I would like to involve the year before because it was an incredible time in my football life. I didn’t experience it before - not that good - the consistency the boys show is so exceptional. We will not stop, we really have to stay focused, because we see the opportunity. I will promise we will improve. But this will not mean we will win everything, but that we will improve. City is exceptional, so I cannot promise that we will win something. If you ask my team at Mainz, they worked hard. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> as well. This group is a mix - we have a lot of world class players, but other clubs do too<br /><br />The consistency comes from the mix of determination, buying into ideas, attitude, character, personality. That’s what makes this group special. They are confident because we won, but they are humble. If they stay humble, we have a good chance to be successful. It helped massively that we won the Champions League. It helps from a confidence point of view - from the nearly man to a winner. We get a super push from our supporters, every two weeks we have the best atmosphere in football. We have a good situation, we use our history instead of being held back by it. We will make sure we are still good from now on<br /><br />If you want to win the league, it’s pretty much not allowed to lose a game. City have never stopped since Pep was there. We will try not to stop, to improve, to make things special. Tomorrow we train, that’s how it is. We have a common dream. We have big dreams. The more people dream the more important and stronger it gets. So we will not stop. f you really go into detail, you’ll see we have been doing this for three, four years. The intensity was never less, we were not as successful. The boys are more experienced, more convinced. But we know other teams are there and will do a lot to improve their situation. There will be hard fights, and the hard fight starts now.</p>

I cannot begin to tell you how much the players and myself appreciated that and I have no doubt that it was one of the reasons why our performance against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> was so good.<br /><br />What I did not love - and I have to say this - was the scenes that took place at the Pier Head on Friday. I am a human being and your passion is also my passion but right now the most important thing is that we do not have these kind of public gatherings.<br /><br />We owe it to the most vulnerable in our community, to the health workers who have given so much and whom we have applauded and to the police and local authorities who help us as a club not to do this.<br /><br />Please - celebrate - but celebrate in a safe way and in private settings, whereby we do not risk spreading this awful disease further in our community.<br /><br />If things were different I would love nothing more than to celebrate together, to have a parade that would be even bigger than the one after we won the Champions League last year, so that we could all share this special moment but it just is not possible<br /><br />We have all done so much to fight Covid-19 and this effort cannot go to waste. We owe it to ourselves and each other to do what is right and at this moment that means being together and being there for one another by being apart<br /><br />When the time is right we will celebrate. We will enjoy this moment and we will paint the city red. But for now, please stay at home as much as possible. This is not the time to be in the city centre in big numbers or to go near football grounds<br /><br />At the start of this crisis I said that we did not want to play in an empty stadium but if it meant that it helped just one person stay healthy we would do it no questions asked and nothing has changed to make me alter this view<br /><br />I already knew and liked the German word solidarität before I came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now I have learned that the English word is solidarity because I have heard it used by our supporters during the last few months<br /><br />For me, it is the word more than any other that captures what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> people are about. It is why they have come together to make PPE, it is why they have delivered food parcels and medicines to people when they have needed it most and it is why they come together in so many different ways during such a difficult time<br /><br />If we can keep on coming together by being separate we will hopefully play a big part in the fight against this disease. I know that we can do this because I have experienced what a difference can be made and the players and myself have benefited from it<br /><br />Hopefully in a few months from now, or longer if necessary, I can write another letter to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Echo to thank you for putting the health of our people ahead of everything else.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss Klopp on transfers, coronavirus and FSG relationship]</b> Covid has of course influenced both sides with ins and outs, that is completely normal. It’s just not likely that it will be the most busy summer in the world. But maybe at a later point in the year, if the transfer window is still open and we know more, then maybe something could happen. I am very confident that we can keep the team together, but all the rest of the planning is ongoing without knowing. We have no idea at the moment. I don’t know when the new season will start. Nobody knows how the future will be, which is very strange<br /><br />Three months ago nobody knew anything about how it would be and now we act a little bit like everything will be fine again. It is a little bit early to guess that. And in football now we get confronted with how much do you want to spend? How much can you spend if you don’t know how much you can have? That is exactly the situation. We all will pay a bill in the end. It’s not only football. Hopefully it is over soon but nobody knows exactly how big the bill will be. I think it’s completely normal that this is a moment we wait a little bit longer with some decisions or just say ‘we pause and try it again like this’. We should not start taking for granted it all will be fine<br /><br /><b>[There was dismay among supporters when Werner, seen as an ideal fit for the Reds’ system and a player with the potential to develop into one of the world’s top forwards, moved to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> earlier this month]</b> This squad… look at it. It is not a squad you have to change now and say ‘OK, we need this position and this position’. If you are a football supporter, you still want a backup for him and him, of course. Even if you are completely happy with the first XI, you still want backups for everyone. We don’t have a first XI, I’d say we have a first 16 or 17, where they can all play to the same level. But this is what we have to use, 100 per cent. And what we want to create are transfers internally<br /><br />So now we have the first glimpses of <a href="neco-williams.html">Neco Williams</a>. He would not be here in this position if we were not convinced. All these boys, Curtis <b>[Jones]</b>, Harvey <b>[Elliott]</b>, Ki-Jana <b>[Hoever]</b>, Sepp <b>[<a href="sepp-van-den-berg.html">van den Berg</a>]</b>, Yasser <b>[Larouci]</b>, Leighton <b>[Clarkson]</b>, Jake <b>[Cain]</b>, all these boys have done really well. And a few I don’t know yet but I will know them soon<br /><br />We cannot spend millions and millions and millions because we think it is nice to do. We want to strengthen this squad, and this squad is strong. The problem with a strong squad is how do you improve a strong squad on the transfer market? It works with money, obviously. That is possible. But it never works only with money. You have to be creative and we try to be creative. We try to find solutions internally. There is still a lot to come. We have three or four players who can still make big, big steps, who are not in the first 12 or 13 so far. That is the pressure we make as well, internally. We have had these discussions throughout the last four-and-a-half years. You asked me if I will find solutions in the transfer market and you are right, we did that, 100 per cent. We did smart business, brought good players in and then did something on the training pitch, and that is not finished yet<br /><br /><b>[Klopp also opened up on his relationship with Fenway Sports Group]</b> The relationship was exceptional from the first day. The first meeting was in New York <b>[in 2015]</b> that’s true. But the first phone call with Mike <b>[Gordon, the FSG president]</b> was before that, three days before maybe, I don’t know. I was still in bed! It was a nice day, I remember that, but I had nothing to do. I had time off and my phone started to ring. I knew that Mike, or someone from FSG, was going to call. I didn’t know Mike at that point. But we had a one-hour talk on the phone. I obviously convinced him in a way that he wanted to meet in New York to bring the deal over the line. That’s how it started. From that moment on, we had a very, very good relationship on a professional basis and a personal basis as well. With Mike, we work closely together - that’s how it is. But it’s Mike, Michael <b>[Edwards, the sporting director]</b> and myself. We pretty much are the transfer committee! They were my first owners, so I can’t compare them. They are the best owners I ever worked with for sure! That’s cool.<br /><br />There is no problem if it doesn’t happen, you don’t need to have a personal relationship maybe in this business. But we have worked brilliantly together and we have a very good relationship. That makes it pretty special. First and foremost, they wanted to support us. Maybe not always at first with money but with a lot of trust and faith in the things we do. That was apparent from the first second. It was always clear. We finished eighth in 2016 - ninth would have been the worst ever, right? - but there was never doubt, not from that side. I’m pretty sure there was doubt from the outside. But from the owners’ side, there was never. They wanted to give us time. They saw the little steps and that helped massively. We could make it, step-by-step</p>

They had a week off while we played on Thursday. We have to give Villa a proper fight. In possession, they make the pitch big, play diagonal balls, use their speed. They are good. But usually in games against top-six teams, they don’t have 50-60 per cent of the ball, it’s more like between 25 and 35. But it’s not about that, it’s about what they’re doing in the moments where they have the ball, and us needing to have solutions for that.</p>

I said that and I thought that was clear. I think we proved that point. And City proved they are an unbelievably good team. Isn’t it nice that another team can be champions even when City is around and plays this kind of football? City are incredible. I’ve seen their games - they haven’t played a bad game all season.

You watched the game completely calm, why do you ask me if we had decent chances? It makes no sense this question.<br /><br />We had decent chances, so ask me about them. We had chances, we got into situations. We didn’t use them, that’s true. Maybe we wasn’t clear enough but we had moments where we could have score and we didn’t. In football if you don’t score it’s difficult to mention chances as everyone forgets them immediately - even I forget them, but that’s the situation. All is OK. It’s not nice, it’s not what we wanted. I wanted to see we had the right attitude and we did, so I’m fine. And the result we have to take</p>

Our boys want to play, want to be involved and see everything in training. They are really close but not losing patience that they are not playing 90 minutes every three days, or something like that. We try to help them as much possible to become the best player they can be. That’s what we do with all the players but with the younger players, the responsibility is obviously bigger on our side.

  <p><b>[Premier League drinks break - is it fair?]</b> I like it a lot. If people think that you only need a drinks break when it’s 40 degrees or something outside and, of course, England is not a country where you need a drinks break really often, especially in the north-west or north-east. But, it’s important just to have that because it was always going to be a strange period for the players and we didn’t know how exactly the boys would react. I really like the opportunity to talk. I think from the moment the referee whistles, it starts, it pretty much takes the players 30 seconds for the players to gather around, so you don’t actually have a lot of time with the players. You really go there for a drink, but you can give one or two information. All coaches have the same opportunity in that moment, so that’s good, it’s fair</p>
