  <p><b>[Spanish striker Fernando Torres is not letting his Euro 2016 snub stop him from focusing everything he has on leading Atletico Madrid to a maiden Champions League triumph]</b> I’m not worried about the Euro, I’ve got the biggest game of my life to play. We are facing an opportunity that life does not give you many times. The growth of this club, to reach two finals in three years, was unimaginable, but we are facing a new chapter in our history and we must write it with a happy ending.<br /><br /><b>[Torres went on to claim that playing arch rivals Madrid in the final does not make the game any more or less special]</b> The opponent in a final is not important, what matters is the result and is the only thing that is going to stay in people’s heads. We see an opportunity to do something that has never been done. There is obviously a rivalry with Real Madrid but that changes in Europe, the games from before count for nothing</p>

It was a scare but I’m counting the hours left to getting back to work with my mates again. In two or three days, I’ll be back to training again. I remember all until the moment before the collision. I experienced a similar situation with Spain several years ago. I recovered consciousness in the ambulance. I thank all the doctors and hospital staff for their attention.<br /><br />These things happen and the other person involved always is more concerned. I talked with Bergantinos yesterday and it was a fortuitous action. I wish the best to the Deportivo players and fans and I look forward to seeing them in La Liga next season</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres believes that the only thing that will be remembered from their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid is whether they win or not]</b> In the end, winning is the only thing you will remember. We have the opportunity that no generation has done and that has to be the motivation. It is a team that always has huge squad depth with a number of young players with hunger to feed the team. The naivety of youth compensates for the lack of experience and Madrid players who aren’t playing as often are making the squad better. Our rivalry means we have special matches, usually in the league and, in recent years, in Europe too. So the importance of the games has increased and that has to make us feel proud.<br /><br />It’s true that there are favourites and Barcelona were against Chelsea. Real Madrid are favourites against anyone, it’s a further stimulus but we know who we are. We can compete against anyone and we are not afraid of anyone. It will be very tough but with encouragement we can reach the other side. A minute can change everything. In that game <b>[Barcelona v Chelsea]</b> I wasn’t a starter and in the end I scored the winner. We have the privilege of being able to write pages in the history of Atletico that have not yet been written. We can give people something we’ve been pursuing for 100 years</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres is hoping to retire at Atletico Madrid]</b> This is where I feel genuinely happy. I am at home. I came back to Atlético after eight years and this is where I feel genuinely happy. My desire is to play for Atletico and retire here while also winning trophies and helping the club to continue to be one of the best in Europe. That is the only option I have in my head at the moment.<br /><br />Simeone has reinforced the belief that has always been what this club is about. I came to Atlético when I was 10 years old and the club taught me about that. There are always periods in the history of a club when things are difficult and you can lose that identity a little but with El Cholo we have recovered all of our values: sacrifice, humility, fighting spirit … and if we all pull in the same direction we can continue to compete with the big and powerful clubs.<br /><br />The big clubs have written their history in years gone by and everyone else now has the opportunity to write new histories in their own way and that is the path that Atlético is on right now</p>

I’ve been part of an Atletico side that is always able to fight for titles and it’ll always be my home. It has been for my whole life. This is my last season at the club - it was not an easy decision, but under the circumstances it’s maybe for the best. I want to continue playing somewhere else. I feel good.</p>

Sagan Tosu were one of the first clubs to be interested in me, they have convinced me with the project. I think Japan and the Japanese League is going to be a great experience, they have made a great effort and they believe that I can be one of the solutions so that the team returns to the place where it has to be. I’ve had offers from France, Germany, even some options from Spain, but at no time did it go through my head to go to a European team, I wanted a new challenge in a totally different place.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres says Andres Iniesta encouraged him to move to Japan and join Sagan Tosu]</b> We are playing against each other on the penultimate day of the season! I spoke with Iniesta when the possibility came up for him. He told me the idea he had. Then everything went as he expected and it became official. He was also aware of my option and encouraged me to go there. The references he had to the league and the country were very similar to the ones I was given.<br /><br />We have had parallel lives: we debuted together in Spain Under-15, we have achieved the greatest successes with the national team as main players and now we finish the same year at our clubs to go to the same league. It will be a pleasure to play against Iniesta. I wish it was with him, but we can make him a place in Sagan Tosu whenever he wants!<br /><br />It’s a very fast football, very dynamic, with very explosive players in short distances. We had the chance to see <b>[Takashi]</b> Inui here in La Liga and it is that profile of an electric player, who attacks the spaces very well. From what I’ve seen of the Sagan Tosu matches that have been sent to me, it’s a very fun type of football. I am going to have fun, I will have space, I will have time to be on the ball, options to attack and defend. I was looking for that fun football, back and forth, with a lot of rhythm. We’ll see if I’m ready and if I’m up to the challenge, but of course I’m really looking forward to it. I was looking for a competitive league that would make me feel like I have a challenge ahead of me. And I’m thinking 100% about football, about being a football player, about doing my best, like a hard-working player, a team player. I’m available to the team for anything. I want to be important, to make myself important, to become a reference for my teammates, for the club, and to ensure that when I finish my time in Japan, they can remember me only with good words, as has happened in all the places I’ve been before. It’s my goal, and that’s what I’m going to try to achieve<br /><br />Yes! I started to like football because of Oliver and Benji. I was between five and seven years old and I had not touched a ball in my life when they started to put Oliver and Benji on TV. I remember that you had to turn the wheel on the television to find the channel. And I stayed glued to the television watching Oliver and Benji. I promise. In fact, once when the president of Sagan Tosu visited Madrid, he brought us a picture of Oliver and Benji where I was one of the characters with the Atlético shirt, and the painting was signed by the author. They found out that I liked it, and they brought this kind of gift</p>

I am still in touch with the staff though so I wish them all the best. I know how important it is for Liverpool to win the Premier League. Hopefully they can win the Premier League and Chelsea can win it the year after.<br /><br />I want both of them to win every game and when they play each other I won’t watch the game! I have feelings for both of them. Liverpool was the best time in my career - I love the city, the supporters and the club. I am still in touch with them and they made me feel at home when I was there. And with Chelsea they gave me what I wanted as a player - trophies. I have great memories of my time at Chelsea so it is difficult to choose</p>

And now we have to start thinking about the new season to get better, and I want to help the club become important in Japan. I have a contract and I will stay at least one more year, and maybe more<br /><br />When I decided to leave Atletico, I was looking for a new challenge, so I found a new challenge in Sagan Tosu.

There will come a time when players will see Atleti as their final destination, where they want to win, to stay, to be part of the history and be remembered forever. It is a step that will be taken soon. No matter where you come from or the name, it matters that you are committed to Atleti. Once you’re there, the people in the club are able to convey what it means. And the day they decide to leave they do so respecting what the club has given them, and nobody will reproach them for anything</p>
