  <p><b>[No goals in six months - Fernando Torres enduring a Japanese nightmare. Torres said at his unveiling]</b> With my play, I want to help raise the level of football in Japan. My goal is to make Sagan Tosu a major club. The sensation that I can return the club to where they should be is another reason why - I see how much confidence they have in me. I have had offers from France, Germany and even one from Spain but at no point did I ever think about going to another European team. I wanted a new challenge in a completely different place. Asia has always treated me very well.<br /><br /><b>[For Torres, Sagan’s situation, let alone location, is a long way from the heights of European success he enjoyed in both England and Spain]</b> When I decided to leave Atletico, I was looking for a new challenge, so I found a new challenge in Sagan Tosu. I have never before fought to stay in a competition; normally, I play for teams playing for trophies. It’s a new experience for me and it was very stressful sometimes. I have more experience than before and I think I am a more complete player than before I came to Japan.</p>

After 18 exciting years, the time has come to put an end to my football career. Next Sunday, the 23rd at 10:00AM, local time in Japan, I will have a press conference in Tokyo to explain all the details. See you there</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres has named <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> as the best player he played alongside as the Spaniard prepares to bid farewell to professional football]</b> I always say the best player I played with is <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>. I found he was the player who completed my game. I think my level got into a different dimension when I was on the pitch with him. It was an amazing three-and-a-half years playing alongside Steven and I would love to go back to those days - even for one minute<br /><br /><b>[He left boyhood club <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> last year to see out the final years of career in Japan]</b> I have a high demand for myself. I’ve always wanted to be honest and to perform at the level I think I should and I think the time I will not be able to perform at the level I ask for myself is not far away, and I don’t want to arrive at the time that I am going on the pitch and I’m not enjoying it<br /><br /><b>[Torres added that playing his final game against friends <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and David Villa, both of whom play for Vissel Kobe]</b> To say goodbye to football next to my dear friend <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is something I could never imagine, and Japan is going to make it possible. Also there will be my friend David Villa, with who I probably share the best moments in Spanish football history</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres says Real Madrid will provide Eden Hazard with the platform he needs to reach the highest level]</b> <b>[Madrid]</b> have got the brand where every player in the world wants to play there, and when they call the players see it as a club where you can make history. Hazard is a spectacular footballer who needs the boost from a club like Real Madrid to reach the level he can reach, which he did at Chelsea in a fleeting manner. It remains to be seen if he’s able to push himself to want to be better. His ability and the conditions are perfect. Sometimes it seemed he struggled to want to be better when I saw him training, it was clear he could be at the level of the best. Now he’s got the stage on which to do it. It’ll depend more on his mentality than his football.<br /><br /><b>[Madrid sold Marcos Llorente to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> in a reported €35m. Torres does not see an issue with Llorente moving from Atleti’s arch-rivals]</b> Atleti is bigger now than thinking about which team the players come from. What’s more important is where they are leaving to go. There will come a time when players will see Atleti as their final destination, where they want to win, to stay, to be part of the history and be remembered forever. It is a step that will be taken soon. No matter where you come from or the name, it matters that you are committed to Atleti. Once you’re there, the people in the club are able to convey what it means. And the day they decide to leave they do so respecting what the club has given them, and nobody will reproach them for anything</p>
