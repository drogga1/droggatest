  <p><b>[Fernando Torres has announced that he will leave Atletico Madrid at the end of the 2017-18 season]</b> When I joined Atletico I was 10 years old and it’s my house. I was lucky to debut, to play, to score goals… it’s always been my home. I can have many houses, but only one home. I’ve been part of an Atletico side that is always able to fight for titles and it’ll always be my home. It has been for my whole life. This is my last season at the club - it was not an easy decision, but under the circumstances it’s maybe for the best. I want to continue playing somewhere else. I feel good.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres to join Sagan Tosu in Japan]</b> We have had proposals from all continents. My new team will be the Japanese side Sagan Tosu. Sagan Tosu were one of the first clubs to be interested in me, they have convinced me with the project. I think Japan and the Japanese League is going to be a great experience, they have made a great effort and they believe that I can be one of the solutions so that the team returns to the place where it has to be. I’ve had offers from France, Germany, even some options from Spain, but at no time did it go through my head to go to a European team, I wanted a new challenge in a totally different place.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres says Andres Iniesta encouraged him to move to Japan and join Sagan Tosu]</b> We are playing against each other on the penultimate day of the season! I spoke with Iniesta when the possibility came up for him. He told me the idea he had. Then everything went as he expected and it became official. He was also aware of my option and encouraged me to go there. The references he had to the league and the country were very similar to the ones I was given.<br /><br />We have had parallel lives: we debuted together in Spain Under-15, we have achieved the greatest successes with the national team as main players and now we finish the same year at our clubs to go to the same league. It will be a pleasure to play against Iniesta. I wish it was with him, but we can make him a place in Sagan Tosu whenever he wants!<br /><br />It’s a very fast football, very dynamic, with very explosive players in short distances. We had the chance to see <b>[Takashi]</b> Inui here in La Liga and it is that profile of an electric player, who attacks the spaces very well. From what I’ve seen of the Sagan Tosu matches that have been sent to me, it’s a very fun type of football. I am going to have fun, I will have space, I will have time to be on the ball, options to attack and defend. I was looking for that fun football, back and forth, with a lot of rhythm. We’ll see if I’m ready and if I’m up to the challenge, but of course I’m really looking forward to it. I was looking for a competitive league that would make me feel like I have a challenge ahead of me. And I’m thinking 100% about football, about being a football player, about doing my best, like a hard-working player, a team player. I’m available to the team for anything. I want to be important, to make myself important, to become a reference for my teammates, for the club, and to ensure that when I finish my time in Japan, they can remember me only with good words, as has happened in all the places I’ve been before. It’s my goal, and that’s what I’m going to try to achieve<br /><br />Yes! I started to like football because of Oliver and Benji. I was between five and seven years old and I had not touched a ball in my life when they started to put Oliver and Benji on TV. I remember that you had to turn the wheel on the television to find the channel. And I stayed glued to the television watching Oliver and Benji. I promise. In fact, once when the president of Sagan Tosu visited Madrid, he brought us a picture of Oliver and Benji where I was one of the characters with the Atlético shirt, and the painting was signed by the author. They found out that I liked it, and they brought this kind of gift</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres has admitted he wants to see Liverpool win the Premier League ahead of his other former club Chelsea]</b> At Chelsea there are still some team-mates that I played with but at Liverpool there is nobody there - only Alberto Moreno, who I played with at the national team. I am still in touch with the staff though so I wish them all the best. I know how important it is for Liverpool to win the Premier League. Hopefully they can win the Premier League and Chelsea can win it the year after.<br /><br />I want both of them to win every game and when they play each other I won’t watch the game! I have feelings for both of them. Liverpool was the best time in my career - I love the city, the supporters and the club. I am still in touch with them and they made me feel at home when I was there. And with Chelsea they gave me what I wanted as a player - trophies. I have great memories of my time at Chelsea so it is difficult to choose</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres has confirmed that he will stay in Japan for another season with Sagan Tosu]</b> I’m really happy with the club and the country. I knew it was a very difficult challenge to help the team staying in J1. So now the season has finished and we can say objective is done, and I’m really happy with the way it is going. And now we have to start thinking about the new season to get better, and I want to help the club become important in Japan. I have a contract and I will stay at least one more year, and maybe more<br /><br />When I decided to leave Atletico, I was looking for a new challenge, so I found a new challenge in Sagan Tosu. I have never before fought to stay in a competition, normally I play for teams playing for trophies. It’s a new experience for me and it was very stressful sometimes, I have more experience than before and I think I am a more complete player than before I came to Japan</p>

  <p><b>[No goals in six months - Fernando Torres enduring a Japanese nightmare. Torres said at his unveiling]</b> With my play, I want to help raise the level of football in Japan. My goal is to make Sagan Tosu a major club. The sensation that I can return the club to where they should be is another reason why - I see how much confidence they have in me. I have had offers from France, Germany and even one from Spain but at no point did I ever think about going to another European team. I wanted a new challenge in a completely different place. Asia has always treated me very well.<br /><br /><b>[For Torres, Sagan’s situation, let alone location, is a long way from the heights of European success he enjoyed in both England and Spain]</b> When I decided to leave Atletico, I was looking for a new challenge, so I found a new challenge in Sagan Tosu. I have never before fought to stay in a competition; normally, I play for teams playing for trophies. It’s a new experience for me and it was very stressful sometimes.

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres has named <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> as the best player he played alongside as the Spaniard prepares to bid farewell to professional football]</b> I always say the best player I played with is <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>. I found he was the player who completed my game. I think my level got into a different dimension when I was on the pitch with him. It was an amazing three-and-a-half years playing alongside Steven and I would love to go back to those days - even for one minute<br /><br /><b>[He left boyhood club <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> last year to see out the final years of career in Japan]</b> I have a high demand for myself. I’ve always wanted to be honest and to perform at the level I think I should and I think the time I will not be able to perform at the level I ask for myself is not far away, and I don’t want to arrive at the time that I am going on the pitch and I’m not enjoying it<br /><br /><b>[Torres added that playing his final game against friends <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="david-villa.html">David Villa</a>, both of whom play for Vissel Kobe]</b> To say goodbye to football next to my dear friend <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is something I could never imagine, and Japan is going to make it possible.

  <p><b>[Fernando Torres says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will provide <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> with the platform he needs to reach the highest level]</b> <b>[Madrid]</b> have got the brand where every player in the world wants to play there, and when they call the players see it as a club where you can make history. <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> is a spectacular footballer who needs the boost from a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to reach the level he can reach, which he did at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in a fleeting manner. It remains to be seen if he’s able to push himself to want to be better. His ability and the conditions are perfect. Sometimes it seemed he struggled to want to be better when I saw him training, it was clear he could be at the level of the best. Now he’s got the stage on which to do it. It’ll depend more on his mentality than his football.<br /><br /><b>[Madrid sold Marcos Llorente to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> in a reported €35m. Torres does not see an issue with Llorente moving from Atleti’s arch-rivals]</b> Atleti is bigger now than thinking about which team the players come from. What’s more important is where they are leaving to go. There will come a time when players will see Atleti as their final destination, where they want to win, to stay, to be part of the history and be remembered forever. It is a step that will be taken soon. No matter where you come from or the name, it matters that you are committed to Atleti. Once you’re there, the people in the club are able to convey what it means. And the day they decide to leave they do so respecting what the club has given them, and nobody will reproach them for anything</p>
