  <p><b>[John Aloisi on taking Australia’s fifth, and ultimately decisive penalty that sent the Socceroos to Germany 2006]</b> Arnie (Graham Arnold) came around and asked who wanted pens. I put my hand up and he wanted to put me first. I said, ‘Nah, fifth.’ How did it feel doing the walk from the centre circle? You might think I was crapping myself, but it was the best walk I’ve ever had. I knew if I hit it like I had the day before at training, we were going to the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chanathip-songkrasin.html">Chanathip Songkrasin</a> also scored a memorable goal against Brisbane Roar when he spun his man about 40 yards out, accelerated and held off another challenge before rounding the keeper and rounding off a 3-0 win. After that game, Roar manager John Aloisi hailed the influence of Chanathip. The former Portsmouth, Osasuna and Australia striker said]</b> <a href="chanathip-songkrasin.html">Chanathip Songkrasin</a>’s a brilliant player. We knew that, and we’ve seen him not only with Muang Thong but with the national team. He’s an exciting talent, and he can turn a game on its head at times by beating players. Even if you’re well organised, he beats a player and all of a sudden you become open. That’s what he’s capable of doing. We knew that he was going to be dangerous against us</p>
