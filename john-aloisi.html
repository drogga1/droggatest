  <p><b>[John Aloisi on taking Australia’s fifth, and ultimately decisive penalty that sent the Socceroos to Germany 2006]</b> Arnie (Graham Arnold) came around and asked who wanted pens. I put my hand up and he wanted to put me first. I said, ‘Nah, fifth.’ How did it feel doing the walk from the centre circle? You might think I was crapping myself, but it was the best walk I’ve ever had. I knew if I hit it like I had the day before at training, we were going to the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi is planning to stay as coach of Brisbane Roar]</b> I’ve always mentioned I want to stay at Brisbane Roar. Do I want to go through what we’ve been through the last two pre-seasons? No. They’re the discussions we’re having. I want to make sure the club is going to head in the right direction because I want to be a part of that, because it’s unfair for everyone involved if that’s going to be the case. I don’t want that to happen, for the players, for whoever works within the club and the fans. I’m confident I’ll be staying here and I want to stay.<br /><br />The results of the past two games haven’t gone our way but in terms of did we deserve to lose both those games? No. So we expect the boys to respond down in Melbourne and this is what Brisbane Roar love - no-one thinking we can go down there and win, backs against the wall and we want to go down there and put in a good performance</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi said his younger players showed what they can do at senior level after helping Brisbane Roar advance in AFC Champions League qualifying]</b> It was good to give a lot of the young boys an opportunity to give them a taste of what it’s like in Asia.<br /><br />Those boys have been training with us now for a couple of seasons already so they know what we want. It’s not easy to give them minutes but tonight was a perfect opportunity. But they all did well. Even Dane Ingham - he’s not naturally a right back, he’s learning that position</p>

  <p><b>[Coach John Aloisi labelled Brisbane Roar’s 2-0 AFC Champions League win over Shanghai Shenhua as ‘the biggest’ of his time at the A-League club]</b> Since I’ve been up been here, that’s probably been the biggest win - especially because a lot of people really didn’t give us a chance of beating them. But we showed we’re not only a good footballing team but we can also fight when we have to and defend.<br /><br />People shouldn’t underestimate the culture we’ve got at Brisbane Roar. We’ve shown that time and time again. It was a brilliant result - a tough game, but bloody hell, it was an unbelievable atmosphere, and a really good performance. We know it’s going to be difficult, we know we’ve got another big couple of months coming up, but this is the position we wanted to be in<br /><br />We knew that it was going to be a tough game with the way Shanghai Shenhua play and their passionate supporters giving them a lift. I thought we played well in the first half. In the second half they got on top, we had to defend and we may have gotten lucky a few times but it’s a great result<br /><br />Because of the conditions in Brisbane we’re very fit so when we come and play in the cold we can run a lot more. That was a big advantage for us today</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi felt his side missed a huge opportunity to punish Melbourne City in their 2-2 draw]</b> Obviously we’re a little disappointed in the result because we felt when we went 2-0 up into the second half, we had a few one-on-ones where we could have actually punished Melbourne City. All in all were disappointed not to have three points but were proud of the boys, especially the ones that played through the week, with the travelling and backing up tonight, they gave everything. We probably lacked that zip during the game but we still tried to go for the three points. It was difficult. We arrived yesterday afternoon and we had to play tonight. So credit to the boys because it’s not easy.</p>

  <p><b>[Despite preparing to face one of the A-League’s more physical sides in Perth, Aloisi isn’t worried about testing his youngsters]</b> Physically last year we probably struggled against Perth. This year, we played them in pre-season for a reason and we beat them. We played them up here, we beat them - physically we’re fine.<br /><br />They’ve <b>[Glory]</b> obviously hit their straps of late and playing over there it’s going to be a tough game but one that we’re looking forward to</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi conceded a fresher Muangthong United proved to be a difficult opponent for his undermanned side]</b> It was a difficult night. They made it hard for us, they were a good team like we knew they would. They were a bit fresher than us and that’s their strongest XI, and we had to make a few changes due to injury and fatigue. But I can’t fault the players. It was a hard night, at least we go something out of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[John Aloisi has reiterated his demand that Football Federation Australia be more flexible with A-League scheduling following Brisbane Roar’s 6-0 loss to Ulsan in the AFC Champions League]</b> The scheduling’s caught up on us. I’m sure that the FFA will look into it and make sure this doesn’t happen in the future. It’s only hurting the A-League and it hurt us definitely <b>[against Ulsan]</b>. It’s nearly impossible if they don’t help with the scheduling of the league. They have to sit down with coaches and clubs and make sure that they learn from these mistakes because we will.<br /><br />Everyone was going on about how good we were and about how strong Australian football is becoming after we won in Shanghai, but they <b>[FFA]</b> can’t let it go like this because it’s not right for the players, it’s not right for Australian football. When we’re at our best, we can compete with Asia, but when they make it nearly impossible it’s going to be hard</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chanathip-songkrasin.html">Chanathip Songkrasin</a> also scored a memorable goal against Brisbane Roar when he spun his man about 40 yards out, accelerated and held off another challenge before rounding the keeper and rounding off a 3-0 win. After that game, Roar manager John Aloisi hailed the influence of Chanathip. The former Portsmouth, Osasuna and Australia striker said]</b> <a href="chanathip-songkrasin.html">Chanathip Songkrasin</a>’s a brilliant player. We knew that, and we’ve seen him not only with Muang Thong but with the national team. He’s an exciting talent, and he can turn a game on its head at times by beating players. Even if you’re well organised, he beats a player and all of a sudden you become open. That’s what he’s capable of doing. We knew that he was going to be dangerous against us</p>
