  <p><b>[John Aloisi on taking Australia’s fifth, and ultimately decisive penalty that sent the Socceroos to Germany 2006]</b> Arnie (Graham Arnold) came around and asked who wanted pens. I put my hand up and he wanted to put me first. I said, ‘Nah, fifth.’ How did it feel doing the walk from the centre circle? You might think I was crapping myself, but it was the best walk I’ve ever had. I knew if I hit it like I had the day before at training, we were going to the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi is planning to stay as coach of Brisbane Roar]</b> I’ve always mentioned I want to stay at Brisbane Roar. Do I want to go through what we’ve been through the last two pre-seasons? No. They’re the discussions we’re having. I want to make sure the club is going to head in the right direction because I want to be a part of that, because it’s unfair for everyone involved if that’s going to be the case. I don’t want that to happen, for the players, for whoever works within the club and the fans. I’m confident I’ll be staying here and I want to stay.<br /><br />The results of the past two games haven’t gone our way but in terms of did we deserve to lose both those games? No. So we expect the boys to respond down in Melbourne and this is what Brisbane Roar love - no-one thinking we can go down there and win, backs against the wall and we want to go down there and put in a good performance</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi said his younger players showed what they can do at senior level after helping Brisbane Roar advance in AFC Champions League qualifying]</b> It was good to give a lot of the young boys an opportunity to give them a taste of what it’s like in Asia.<br /><br />Those boys have been training with us now for a couple of seasons already so they know what we want. It’s not easy to give them minutes but tonight was a perfect opportunity. But they all did well. Even Dane Ingham - he’s not naturally a right back, he’s learning that position</p>

  <p><b>[Coach John Aloisi labelled Brisbane Roar’s 2-0 AFC Champions League win over Shanghai Shenhua as ‘the biggest’ of his time at the A-League club]</b> Since I’ve been up been here, that’s probably been the biggest win - especially because a lot of people really didn’t give us a chance of beating them. But we showed we’re not only a good footballing team but we can also fight when we have to and defend.<br /><br />People shouldn’t underestimate the culture we’ve got at Brisbane Roar. We’ve shown that time and time again. It was a brilliant result - a tough game, but bloody hell, it was an unbelievable atmosphere, and a really good performance. We know it’s going to be difficult, we know we’ve got another big couple of months coming up, but this is the position we wanted to be in<br /><br />We knew that it was going to be a tough game with the way Shanghai Shenhua play and their passionate supporters giving them a lift. I thought we played well in the first half. In the second half they got on top, we had to defend and we may have gotten lucky a few times but it’s a great result<br /><br />Because of the conditions in Brisbane we’re very fit so when we come and play in the cold we can run a lot more. That was a big advantage for us today</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi felt his side missed a huge opportunity to punish Melbourne City in their 2-2 draw]</b> Obviously we’re a little disappointed in the result because we felt when we went 2-0 up into the second half, we had a few one-on-ones where we could have actually punished Melbourne City. All in all were disappointed not to have three points but were proud of the boys, especially the ones that played through the week, with the travelling and backing up tonight, they gave everything. We probably lacked that zip during the game but we still tried to go for the three points. It was difficult. We arrived yesterday afternoon and we had to play tonight. So credit to the boys because it’s not easy.</p>

  <p><b>[Despite preparing to face one of the A-League’s more physical sides in Perth, Aloisi isn’t worried about testing his youngsters]</b> Physically last year we probably struggled against Perth. This year, we played them in pre-season for a reason and we beat them. We played them up here, we beat them - physically we’re fine.<br /><br />They’ve <b>[Glory]</b> obviously hit their straps of late and playing over there it’s going to be a tough game but one that we’re looking forward to</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi conceded a fresher Muangthong United proved to be a difficult opponent for his undermanned side]</b> It was a difficult night. They made it hard for us, they were a good team like we knew they would. They were a bit fresher than us and that’s their strongest XI, and we had to make a few changes due to injury and fatigue. But I can’t fault the players. It was a hard night, at least we go something out of it.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi has reiterated his demand that Football Federation Australia be more flexible with A-League scheduling following Brisbane Roar’s 6-0 loss to Ulsan in the AFC Champions League]</b> The scheduling’s caught up on us. I’m sure that the FFA will look into it and make sure this doesn’t happen in the future. It’s only hurting the A-League and it hurt us definitely <b>[against Ulsan]</b>. It’s nearly impossible if they don’t help with the scheduling of the league. They have to sit down with coaches and clubs and make sure that they learn from these mistakes because we will.<br /><br />Everyone was going on about how good we were and about how strong Australian football is becoming after we won in Shanghai, but they <b>[FFA]</b> can’t let it go like this because it’s not right for the players, it’s not right for Australian football. When we’re at our best, we can compete with Asia, but when they make it nearly impossible it’s going to be hard</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi labelled his side’s 3-0 loss to Kashima Antlers a very disappointing result]</b> I think that we put in a very good performance until the second goal was scored. <b>[The]</b> Antlers’ confidence returned and our morale fell. It was a very disappointing result.</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi believes his side’s history-making victory over Kashima Antlers will give them a boost in both the AFC Champions League and the A-League finals]</b> It gives the boys plenty of confidence. Not only for the rest of the ACL campaign but also leading into finals because we know what Kashima are like. They’re a top side. They’re probably - if not one of the best in Asia - they are the best because they made the final of the Club World Championship <b>[sic]</b> only a couple of months ago taking Real Madrid all the way to extra time, and we saw their quality again tonight. So as a win, that was a huge win because that shows how good we can be.<br /><br />I’m not worried because we’ve gone virtually six months without having a complete squad. We’ve had to rely on players coming in, stepping up. Joey Caletti for Matt McKay - our captain - again, superb performance … it’s something we’ve had to deal with because of the schedule we’ve been given that we’ve had to rely on a big squad</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi is adamant he has the squad to make history]</b> We’ve got big-game players, we’ve got players that have had this experience before and players that know what to do come finals time. We’re going to have to make history <b>[to win the championship]</b>. We know it can be done. There’s no doubt about that … we’ve got the squad that can go all the way but first we’ve got a very difficult game but I think an exciting game tomorrow night.<br /><br />That hurt that night because we wanted to go the grand final and, you know, it hurt in the off-season but it just drove us more in pre-season that we want to go the grand final. Whether it was against the Wanderers or it was against someone else, there’s no revenge here. What we want is to go all the<br /><br />If we can get over 30,000 there for the game and make it an occasion, a spectacle, everyone will remember that day and that will help us get over the line against a good Wanderers side</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi has declared outgoing playmaker Thomas Broich is fully focused on Friday night’s A-League elimination final against Western Sydney Wanderers]</b> At the beginning of the season and halfway through the season, he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to play on but just a couple of weeks ago he decided that he did and I didn’t even make a decision.<br /><br />It was something that Thomas made and we respect that and now we’re just focused on the game. I spoke to him yesterday afternoon, gave him a call to see how he was and he said ‘I’m preparing exactly the same like I would any other game’ and that’s all I wanted to hear<br /><br /><b>[Aloisi wasn’t willing to get into the details of why Roar were unable to retain Broich]</b> The salary cap restricts you. There’s no two ways about it. It’s very difficult to explain to the general public what goes on behind closed doors but Thomas Broich for me has been a joy to coach. I get along really well with Thomas</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar coach John Aloisi has again voiced his frustration over Football Federation Australia’s scheduling around AFC Champions League matches]</b> We still play in a league in which the federation hasn’t given us the best opportunity to do as well as we would like to in the Champions League. When we played Muangthong in Brisbane, we played on the Saturday, and again on the Tuesday, because that was our schedule, and they didn’t change the game for us. At the moment, I have to think about the competitions that we’re in and where it’s going to be worthwhile trying to achieve our goal of winning something. We’ve currently got more of an opportunity of winning something in the A-League. It doesn’t mean that we’re taking this game for granted, or lightly. We still want to play our football, and hopefully progress but, at the moment, our full strength side will play on Sunday in Melbourne.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi revealed he was deflated after back-to-back semi-final losses for Brisbane Roar and declared Melbourne Victory can win the A-League grand final]</b> We just weren’t able to play our football that we’ve been playing. That’s the thing that I’m most disappointed about because you can win or lose football games but we didn’t even play the football that we know we can play, and that we’ve been playing. But you have to give credit to Victory as well. I’m just deflated because I wanted to make the grand final and all the boys are as well.<br /><br />Victory have definitely got a chance. When you’ve got players like Berisha that will step up and score goals in important games, of course you’ve got a chance of winning. It’ll be a good final - the two sides that finished top two, so you have to say they’re the best two sides this season. I wouldn’t say it’s a given that Sydney are going to win. Even though they’ve beaten Victory three times, they’ve been close games. So I think Victory have got a good opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi has declared Brisbane Roar are in a very healthy position as they look ahead to 2017-18, after their season ended with a 3-2 loss to Ulsan in the AFC Champions League]</b> We can’t forget the players we’ve got coming through. We gave, I think, seven players their debut this season. This doesn’t happen many places. Brisbane Roar have always been a team and a club that bring through great young players … and we’re proud of that. I see that we’re in a very healthy position.<br /><br />We should have had the win. I thought we dominated most of the game. A couple of errors cost us, which was a pity because it would have been nice to finish the season off with a win<br /><br />What was the hardest thing this year was the qualifier against Shanghai Shenhua. When we won that, we had to come back within essentially two days to play Melbourne City, and from there we copped a lot of injuries, we had two trips to Perth - the FFA know the scheduling was bad. Considering all that, we ended up nearly in a grand final. People should be proud of what they’ve achieved and what as a club we’ve achieved</p>

We knew that, and we’ve seen him not only with Muang Thong but with the national team. He’s an exciting talent, and he can turn a game on its head at times by beating players. Even if you’re well organised, he beats a player and all of a sudden you become open. That’s what he’s capable of doing. We knew that he was going to be dangerous against us</p>
