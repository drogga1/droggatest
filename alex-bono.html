  <p><b>[Toronto FC stakes claim after downing Orlando]</b> It doesn’t matter how you get a win, it matters that you do get the win and we’ve gotten nine points in three straight and it’s huge for us going forwards. We’re going on the road for a few games and we’ll try to keep the momentum going. Momentum is a huge thing in this league and we’re going to try to keep it going in our favor.</p>

  <p><b>[No Giovinco, no Altidore? No problem for Toronto FC in rampant victory over Columbus]</b> It was awesome. We talked before the game about how no Jozy, no Seba doesn’t mean we take the foot off the gas. We came into the game expecting to make a statement and we did</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Steffen and Alex Bono had crossed paths in their journey as young goalkeepers]</b> Zack’s kind of always been one of those kids that had a high amount of buzz around him. I played against him in the <b>[Development]</b> Academy. Back then all the kids would look at player rankings of the kids coming up and which kids were in the youth national teams so he was always a kid I knew about because of that.<br /><br />He’s also grown to be a friend of mine, and we’ve been able to talk in the couple of games we’ve played this year. He’s had a really good year. He’s an incredible talent, I think there’s a lot of upside to his game, and you can see the maturity he’s gained throughout the season and how much he’s improved.</p>

  <p><b>[Giovinco’s free kicks could be key]</b> I went up to <b>[Robles]</b> and said, ‘Listen, I’ve seen that same free kick after training 100 times’. The more you see it, the more you realize you’re never going to get close to it.<br /><br />He just has this way about him that he always seems to find the back of the net. And he always seems to hit it so sweetly and so perfectly. I know it’s been a nightmare to face, but it’s been a real pleasure to watch. Whenever it’s in Seba range I’m glued in back in our goal. It really is a joy to watch<br /><br /><b>[So what makes Giovinco so dangerous on free kicks?]</b> He can disguise it anyway he wants, and that’s what makes it so deadly. You can’t cheat it because he’ll put it back on the keeper’s side and it’ll be on your shoulders<br /><br />You do build a certain level of confidence from it, especially when you haven’t saved one and you’re able to get a hand to it. <b>[Giovinco]</b> will be the first one to smile at you and give you the thumbs up.</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Bono blossoming in goal for record-setting Toronto FC]</b> My goal this year was to make it very difficult for the coaches to take me out of the lineup when I got the opportunity. That’s how I approach every game, knowing I have to keep performing to keep the job.<br /><br /><b>[Bono’s rapid ascent began before he was drafted]</b> It was wild and it went by really quickly. I remember I was on my way to the MAC Hermann <b>[Award]</b> ceremony and I get a call from Klinsmann. I thought it was a prank at first. All of a sudden I’m in a locker room sitting across from some of the same veterans who were in the World Cup the summer before<br /><br />Your first thought is it’s disappointing. You have expectations for yourself, and I believe every player should have high expectations for themselves their rookie year, but then it’s on them to adjust and accommodate accordingly to what the team view is of them. They wanted me to be part of the USL team and get experience and get minutes, and they were valuable minutes. I learned a lot in that first year with TFC II. Just being hard-nosed and being able to deal with the adversity that getting sent down would give somebody<br /><br />When I finally got the opportunity to come back up, it had a higher value to me to stay there because I knew what it had been like to be sent down and have a bit of a demotion. I definitely had a higher value of my time with the first team, and when I was up there for good, it was important for me to not take it for granted<br /><br />MLS Cup wasn’t quite a really exciting game in terms of the action part of it, but just being part of an occasion like that is something I’ll never forget. Taking that experience with me and just being part of that team is something that gives you experience even though it wasn’t game experience. I gained the experience of being in that scenario, now this year I know what it’s like to be in a full stadium and what that environment is like, and all the things you have to deal with around the games<br /><br />Being a part of the national team and playing for the national team is the biggest honor you can have, and just to be a part of that program is an ultimate goal of mine. If you take care of business with your club team, the national team will come along with that</p>
