Hat-trick hero Ibrahimovic says Comparing Carlos Vela to him was a big mistake</p>

  <p><b>[Los Angeles FC striker Carlos Vela has hit back at <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>’s claims that he’s ‘by far’ the best player in <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>]</b> Comparing would show a lack of respect towards him, but if we look at the stats and forget age and whatever, I’m better than him right now, that’s the reality. And in terms of the rest, he’s been <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> are better than him. The rest of us aren’t in the same league.<br /><br /><b>[Despite Friday night’s win, the Galaxy are still nine points behind LAFC, sitting in second place in the West. Vela was keen to focus on that fact after Friday’s game]</b> Today we didn’t have a good game. We are still in first and we have to keep that place and forget this game</p>

  <p><b>[Vela is proud to be a Mexican player achieving success abroad]</b> I don’t send (the critics) any message. At the end of the day, every person makes their own evaluation and their own criticism and it’s all respectable. I don’t want to say who is right and who isn’t. Every person things in some way. I see it from the positive side. I see that I’m making history in this league and putting the name of my country on high, which is the only thing I’m thinking about<br /><br /><b>[Vela sort of ‘shot back’ at <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>’s comments but not how many members of the press might have hoped]</b> I think the important part is coming so I have to finish the same or better, and I hope I can take the MVP and the championship<br /><br />I think you always have the hope or motivation to get things like the record. You get it because you work every day to be able to have rewards like this. Obviously, it doesn’t always happen and it’s not easy to do it, but it’s what has kept me at a good level. I want to be the best in this league, try to show it every weekend and there are still nine games, so I have to close well to enjoy and be able to say it was a great year<br /><br />Obviously, that’s the principal objective, but you also have to look at all the records we’re getting as a team, as players. But of course the top goal and what we’ve been working for since the first day is the title. So it would be something tough after the year we’re having, but we’re going to fight until the last day to get it</p>

My second month for holidays, I was there with my piña colada and my agent called me to say ‘look, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is calling you. They want you to play for four months then you can go back to LA’. I said just say yes, I don’t care about the money or nothing. I’m going to start training tomorrow, give me two weeks to be a little bit fit. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> you can’t say no. … If it was only my choice, for sure, I’d take it<br /><br /><b>[The 30-year-old forward says he would like to spend the rest of his career in Los Angeles]</b> It’s not only the things I want, football is a business and you know how it works. But, if I have everything, I want to be here for the rest of my career. I’m really happy here, playing in LA. I want to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Vela: LAFC has returned me to the happiness I was seeking]</b> I’m really happy, first of all, to be part of this team because it returned to me the happiness I was seeking. I maybe didn’t have as much excitement about playing like I have now, and after that I have to thank my teammates. It’s an individual achievement, but it’s a full-team job. Without them, I wouldn’t be able to have all the goals I have or everything I was able to do. I think it’s a success we’ve created because we started from nothing with this team, so I feel like I really participated in everything we’re getting. I’m thankful for everything that’s happening<br /><br /><b>[For Vela, however, he is confident he could still match the standard required of players in Europe but prefers to be playing in the U.S]</b> I’ve always said that of course I think I could play in important teams in Europe and be an important player, but at the time everything happened I needed or I thought it would be best for career to come here. I think today, the result I was looking for is happening. It’s a bit of what I’ve always said, to try and look for the best for my life and my family, and I’m here. The rest is out of my hands</p>

Enjoy, learn and then come back home<br /><br /><b>[Earlier this year, Ibrahimovic rubbished suggestions Vela was the best player in the league, questioning why his rival was playing in the United States in his prime]</b> I have not had the pleasure <b>[of meeting Ibrahimovic]</b>.

There I started to enjoy my football again after three such bad years of living in England. I didn’t know anything about the Basque Country. I wanted to leave so much that when I heard I had a good offer to play and leave England, it was a case of me saying: ‘I love it! Yes, let’s go!</p>

But after that, I went to London, to sign for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I was not ready for that, everything was too fast, and I was very young. It was a very difficult moment for me.<br /><br />I would not say that it was a moment of great pressure, but mentally you are not prepared for so much. It was a difficult moment because you need time to process everything and start getting down and being normal, the first year it was difficult to be myself, to enjoy life and play, to be normal.<br /><br />But when you start you feel that you are the best of all and that you can do everything and nobody can tell you anything, that was the first mistake I made, over the years I was a better person and a better player</p>

  <p><b>[Vela embracing responsibility of being Los Angeles’ soccer superstar]</b> You are never ready for that kind of spotlight, but when you’re here and you see how sports are, how life is being in one of the biggest cities in the world, you have to be like that. You have to take more responsibility and show something different. When you are there with the best and when you are the best, you have to be there and show how good you are and try and bring something to the people. With that part, I feel really comfortable living here and playing here. I want to be the best every day<br /><br />It’s an honor to be recognized in LA. It’s something really cool. It’s something, you don’t work for that, but when you see that you are doing your best, you are trying to do something for you, for your talent, for the city, and when the people recognize that, you feel special<br /><br />It was a hard moment. At 17 years old, you move from Cancun to London, you’re excited for that but it’s a big change. When you’re not mature, you have more problems, more troubles. Your head isn’t ready to be at one of the biggest clubs in the world. That part was difficult for me. But, honestly, I’m proud to have <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as part of my career. I had good things there. After that, my life changed. I was able to get more experienced, more mature. I’m a better player because of it because you have to have bad moments to improve, to work more. It makes you say, ‘I don’t want to be back in that bad moment’. I want to be in good moments like I am now, so I’m working to keep myself at a high level. Working hard, training hard, taking care of my body, those are the things that, when you are young, you don’t think it is important. That part, I learned from that experience. That’s why I’m the person I am now<br /><br />When I came here, I never expected to make that big of an impact but now that I’m here, I’ve seen things in the league, I get to be a part of BODYARMOR with a lot of good athletes, I feel that I am moving in the right direction and doing things right. It’s putting more pressure on myself to work more and be a better player and a better person too. When they called me to be part of the campaign, it was like, ‘Of course I want to be part of that’. <a href="reece-james.html">James</a> Harden, Kobe was part of this…I’m proud to be part of this group.<br /><br />I want to win <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. It’s the most important thing for me. When you win something individually, it feels good but, in the end, football or soccer is a team sport. If I want to be in the history of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> or the history of LAFC, I have to win titles. That’s my goal. I hope this season or next season I can be MVP again, I can win championships and be in all those places because if you are in those places, it’s because you’re doing the right things.</p>
