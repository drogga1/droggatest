  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Refute Pat Rice Retirement Claims]</b> Contrary to media reports this morning, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> assistant manager Pat Rice is not considering retirement at the end of the current season. He remains a key part of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s backroom staff and is currently helping prepare the team for trip to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger will be very hurt at how an iconic 22-year reign at Arsenal has come to an end]</b> I think he would feel very hurt about the reaction he was getting but at the end of the day we all know we are in a business where it can happen to anybody. It is not the first time it has happened to a football manager but when you think what he has done for our great club it is a shame that it had to end this way. I’m just hoping that for the last home game of the season <b>[against Burnley]</b> everybody shows their appreciation to a wonderful man and a tremendous manager<br /><br />In my eyes he is the best Arsenal manager there has ever been. Having seen the way he works and the way he treats people, everybody is treated with respect. He always looked after his staff, he is just an incredible manager. Everything that he goes in to is researched. When he came to the club all the training schedules were down to the finest minute. He changed the food that the players had, he changed the way they were drinking. Cokes and orange and all that stuff went out of the window. The foresight that he had was just second to none and he changed the way of people’s thinking about football in England, there’s absolutely no doubt about that</p>

  <p><b>[Pat Rice believes Wenger could be the target of a footballing organisation such as UEFA or FIFA]</b> I know he’s very well respected at UEFA and FIFA and I would not be surprised if he had an opportunity to go and join one of those. Football is his love. When I was working there, you would go in the next day and talk about what film or comedy show you watched the previous night, or if you’d been out in the West End. He would come in and ask if anyone had seen Juventus or Roma or Barcelona v Malaga</p>
