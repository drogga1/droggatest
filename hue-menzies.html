  <p><b>[Jamaica qualifies to Women’s World Cup for first time]</b> I’m telling you the amount of sacrifices we’ve made - the staff, the players - for the country, we’re going to change the culture back home. How they perceive women, it’s changed. It’s a big sacrifice. And you know what? Those 20 girls decided they were going to make the change. It’s amazing right now. Not too many words can be said.<br /><br />This is way more than football. Big up to Cedella Marley for putting the neck on the line for us. The thank-yous can’t stop. The sacrifices will still keep plugging, the adversities will always be there, but I’m telling you it’s a lot more than football. This is just a statement. We’re going to go back home and celebrate. There’s not a whole lot of space on that island, but we’re going to find every inch to celebrate on because it’s history</p>

  <p><b>[The Reggae Girlz have disappointed so far, no one is banking on Australia to beat them]</b> They didn’t give up. We gave it everything. I have to give them credit for that. The more and more we play this level of games, the more we will stay switched on</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="usain-bolt.html">Usain Bolt</a> never quite made it as a footballer, the world’s fastest man is still proving a valuable role model for Jamaica at the Women’s World Cup]</b> He’s been a great role model for us. He came on Skype the other day and spoke to the girls. He’s a massive role model for the country, he wears the flag high. He could have easily trained outside the country but he trained in Jamaica, he kept his roots, he hasn’t changed since he was 17 to what he is now. He’s such a positive force, he brings a lot of confidence to our group.<br /><br /><b>[Menzies, a friend of Bolt 9484afd5836d307b314a404d745a9a68, wasn’t too surprised the sprinter failed to become a footballer but admitted it was a sports switch that was always on the cards]</b> Somebody told me his first touch was so bad it took him to Australia. He prefers football to track, he told me that personally, that was his dream<br /><br /><b>[Jamaica simply being at the World Cup is a massive achievement for a side that was disbanded in 2010]</b> We can’t get on any higher platform. We just hope that our federation and corporate Jamaica comes on board and stays on board. We have dealt with adversity. This group and our staff has been resilient. We have really put our best foot forward just by being here</p>

  <p><b>[Hue Menzies admitted he’d pay to watch the Australian captain <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a> in action]</b> It doesn’t get any better than that. The kid is just resilient, she’s a goal scorer, she plays for her badge and her country. I love her attitude, particularly in the box, you can’t teach that. I would pay to come and watch her.</p>
