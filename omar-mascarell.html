  <p><b>[Schalke midfielder Omar Mascarell stated <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> lost their composure and felt <a href="marco-reus.html">Reus</a> and Wolf could have no complaints]</b> When the result is not what you want, sometimes you get nervous and lose yourself. For me it was two red cards. Yes, of course, the title race is done. It’s hard to stomach but it is what it is</p>

  <p><b>[Former team-mate Omar Mascarell says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> striker <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> has been hailed as the world’s best centre-forward in the last decade]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is the biggest club in the world. After all that I’ve seen at this club, nothing impresses me as quickly. In my first training session with the first team, I played with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> and <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> in a team. That was absolutely mad. As a young player from the club’s own youth system, you have almost no chance against such superstars. <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> maybe impressed me the most. For me, he is the world’s best centre-forward in the past 10 years, but also an incredibly nice and down to earth guy who always helps young players and gives them advice. That’s why everyone at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> loves him<br /><br /><b>[Mascarell believes his former team-mates will get along well together in the long term]</b> <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> will learn a lot from Karim, I’m sure. He is still very young, so you have to be patient with him. He is just coming to a new country with a new language and new culture. Not everyone can handle the pressure at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I wish for him to succeed. He has the abilities to do it, I’ve rarely seen such a striker at his age. I’m sure he’ll be worth the fee the club paid for him</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke’s Omar Mascarel thinks <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> will pair well with <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> and Robert Lewandowski]</b> It’s great news that <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> plays in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. He was certainly the player that Bayern needed - one who provides danger between the lines with his power of shooting and combination. He will definitely harmonize perfectly with Thiago and Robert Lewandowski<br /><br /><b>[Mascarell, who played for <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> at Eintracht Frankfurt and won the DFB-Pokal over <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in 2018 alongside him, believes the coach has been underserving of such harsh critiques]</b> Niko has not only made me a better footballer, but has also developed me as a human being. I do not understand those who question him and his footballing expertise. It has been seen with us that he pursues a clear game philosophy, can play many tactical systems and cope with his players. He is the type of coach who criticizes you if you have not given everything. Then it’s time to roll up your sleeves and do it fast. Niko can get very loud in the dressing room, but he’s also very fair and praises you when you’ve done your job</p>

You can compare (Jovic to Benzema), they hold up the ball well, but I see <a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a> as being stronger in the air, he’s very good with his head. He’s practically two-footed, he’s quick, strong. Every ball he gets in the air is a danger for opponents</p>
