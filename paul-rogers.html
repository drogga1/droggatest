  <p><b>[In 1993, American alternative rock band Soul Asylum released ‘Runaway Train’, which became a radio hit all over the world and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1994. Aside from its commercial success, the song had a lasting impact due to its innovative music video, which interspersed scenes of the band with photos and names of missing children. There were four versions made in total: two for the United States, and one apiece for the United Kingdom and Australia. The two U.S. versions featured 36 missing children, 26 of which were later found]</b> The idea for the new transfer announcement initiative actually came from reading an article about the 25th anniversary of Soul Asylum’s ‘Runaway Train’ video. With Roma, we thought, we could try and do something similar but updated for the social media generation, which didn’t exist when Soul Asylum released their video. We want to use the viral nature of social media transfer announcements to help raise awareness for missing children. We have a massive social media following and our announcements generate incredible reach and awareness, all over the world, so we thought that at the exact moment when the world’s attention is on the club’s announcement, we could use our social media channels not for self-promotion but rather to help both the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Telefono Azzurro find missing children</p>

  <p><b>[Italian football in the wake of Corriere dello Sport’s ‘Black Friday’ headline]</b> The intention of the newspaper article was actually positive. But this headline has totally overshadowed the anti-racist message contained within the story. Unfortunately, as we’ve seen on social media, more people will see that ill-judged headline on the front page than read the actual article and it creates new issues at a time when we are all trying to tackle the issue of racism in Italian football</p>
