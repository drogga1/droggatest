It is important to recognise that the followers of Spanish football are not just people who live in Spain.

Because when we have clubs being financed by states, then that has an impact on salaries. That means in other countries with more strict economic controls like Spain and Germany clubs cannot actually ask the state for extra financing to pay those salaries.<br /><br />Organisations and institutions have a responsibility to redistribute the wealth that we generate. All of us, the Spanish league, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. I don’t think we are helping football in any way if we generate wealth and it just goes straight back to the big clubs. In the end instead of having 12 Ferraris, they have 15. We’re dealing with major clubs generating a huge amount of money. So our aim is to redistribute that wealth<br /><br /><b>[Tebas additionally fired criticism at the idea of an expanded Club World Cup]</b> Having been re-elected, I am very critical of the Club World Cup. An organisation like <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> is supposed to be a regulatory body. They draft the different calendars and when we need to play. Sadly, from organising World Cups, they are now talking about Club World Cups and having that every two years. That is not an option because it would change the status quo. This can’t happen. A few weeks ago <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> was talking about how much would be paid if they went to China. They have been talking about redistribution of revenue but haven’t discussed the impact this would have in different countries. Let’s imagine the two teams from Argentina <b>[who will take part in the Club World Cup]</b>. It’s 40 or 50m from a tournament such as this. This would have an impact on the Argentinian Super League.

The scenario may also depend on some Champions League games that will be played at the weekend, which could give us some room to start some clubs later, or that we can recover by starting all a little later. We are even working with leagues like the Italian one, which has 14 games left, and the Danish one, which has 15 remaining. The decision of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to postpone the European Championship has served us well to try to finish the competitions. <br /><br />We made the calendar calculations even before the European Championship was postponed. It was a stage that we knew could be reached and we are working on various start dates. Here you have to work backwards, with what is the last date on which you could play to see the options that may arise. When we start playing there will be full medical guarantees, but that no longer depends on us, it will depend on the governments of the countries. If they guarantee that it can be played, it will be played<br /><br />That will also depend on the governments of each country. You have to think that we are working with 30 different leagues and it will depend on the health authorities if it is played behind closed doors or under what conditions.<br /><br />We are not considering any format change for any competition, including the European ones.

  <p><b>[Tebas confirms talks over May return for La Liga]</b> If we are looking at the economic impact, including the money we would get from European competitions, the revenue Spanish clubs would miss out on if we don’t get back playing again is €1bn. If we do get playing but without spectators, it would be €300m (£264m/$328m). Even if we get back to playing with spectators, the damage this situation has already caused would be €150m.<br /><br /><b>[When pressed on the possibility of the campaign been cancelled entirely]</b> No, not mentioned at all at the moment. It is a hypothesis that we do not contemplate. We want to end it, probably behind closed doors. And it is curious, by chance, that the clubs that want to end the season here are the ones from the bottom of the League, the ones that are fighting not to be relegated. I can assure you that no major nor mid-season championships intend to cancel the season, whoever talks about this does so for personal interests<br /><br />Of all the different scenarios we have been looking at with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to go back to competing, the most probable ones are 28 May, 6 June or 28 June. We can’t say an exact date. This will be given to us by the authorities in Spain. But we still have time to get back to training before that. By the end of the season we would not want to go beyond the month of August, and it is obvious that all this will affect the schedule for the next season</p>

Spanish football does not intend to resort to state aid, we must be economically independent<br /><br />It will be necessary to alter the contracts of the players that expire on June 30, as well as the various loan agreements. It is not simple, but not so complicated. I think that the players will agree and that the different leagues will find a solution that complies with general regulations. It is clear that the current transfer window dates, from July 1 to September 1, will not be suitable and should be changed, but I can’t say much more. We will have to see the recommendations of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and adjust the market to the current conditions generated by the coronavirus, which are decidedly exceptional</p>
