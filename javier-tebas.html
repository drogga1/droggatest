And I’ve seen him play better.<br /><br /><b>[Tebas also played down the Twitter war between Gerard Pique and Sergio Ramos]</b> The Ramos-Pique spat is just one of those football things. There are a lot of pressures and tension, they feel their teams’ colours… in the national team they forget about it. On Twitter Pique is funnier, and he has more cheek.

  <p><b>[La Liga president Javier Tebas knows growth must go beyond El Clasico]</b> The Clasico is the best expression of Spanish football. In fact, our league is the best league in the world. Today with me are two players who have been rivals on the playing field, even more because of their positions on the field. They’re representing the two best clubs that have come out of what may be the best league in the world. But being the best league in the world, we have to keep working because other leagues have grown a lot. They’re getting closer and they want to take that spot.<br /><br />In the league, we pay a lot of attention to clubs that aren’t Real Madrid or Barcelona. They already have their own brand and market on their own. But we’re taking advantage of this to work together to grow the rest of the clubs. We’ve got a project called Liga World that we started three and a half years ago that exists to help teams that aren’t Real Madrid or Barcelona to play games outside Spain<br /><br />We’ve tried, for instance, Atletico Madrid played in San Francisco. We’ve had Valencia, Sevilla, more clubs. Also, digitally we’re putting more attention on these clubs above all in the American market. Social networks like Facebook let us geotarget messages and we’re working with our clubs to geotarget messages, especially to the United States<br /><br />We’re working on making sure those games are broadcasted in the same way as a Real Madrid-Barcelona. Our goal is a game between Eibar and Osasuna or Malaga has the same broadcast quality as a Real Madrid-Barcelona, and I think that in two years we’ll be there. This year there will be 14 stadiums in the top division with aerial cameras. No other league has that. We’re going to have it in every stadium. This year Real Madrid and Barcelona have 360-degree replay cameras. This year three more teams, Atletico Madrid, Valencia and Sevilla, will add the 360 cameras to their broadcasts. Within two years there will be 10 teams <b>[that have the cameras]</b>.<br /><br />We want a Barcelona-Espanyol or a Real Madrid-Atletico Madrid to have the same quality as Real Sociedad-Athletic Bilbao, the same. That’s part of our strategy to get the other clubs seen more. There aren’t games that are better or worse, we’re the league. We’re all the same</p>

It’s that way in the Premier League.

And they have not had a lot of players in the ideal 11 of FifPro either but it keeps on being the league that generates the most income in the world. And that shows that if you have a brand which is what the Premier League has, then it’s not necessary to have the best players to have the best league in the world</p>

  <p><b>[La Liga chief Javier Tebas has slammed proposals to form a European Super League among the continent’s elite clubs]</b> The European Super League would be the end of La Liga and also of the Champions League. I define it harshly, so that everyone understands. The Superliga is the kind of project written up at a bar at five in the morning, a project of different club presidents.<br /><br />There are many arguments against the Superleague. At first it will look beautiful, but the Bayern Munich or Real Madrid fan has become great by winning titles, winning their national competitions, because history is like that. Some teams in the Super League table will finish ninth or 10th. You think of a Real Madrid against Manchester United game and on paper it’s a great match, but of course, one could be in 11th position and another in10th. Let’s see how many fans are left in five years after that. The Champions League must exist, its model is perfect. The clubs win. But a European Super League model would hurt football and, in the long term, will hurt the big clubs too, because it will never provide the economic figures that the big clubs think it will</p>

It’s very important that UEFA does something real about it. It’s something that has unbalanced world football and the structure of the game. You have to punish those teams.<br /><br />Forcing them to sit out a year of the Champions League would send a message that these rules must be taken seriously.

  <p><b>[La Liga president Javier Tebas has hit out at Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain]</b> The problem with PSG and City is they’re state-run clubs: one off petrol money, one off gas. The damage happening on Euro football is massive because they are inflating the market so clubs have to pay ridiculous sums to keep their players. There are clubs who could not care less what their real incomes are when they want to sign a player because they receive incomes from a state. It forces other clubs into an economic situation which is really living on the edge. It skews the balance of the entire European football structure. This is no longer sport. This is no longer an industry. It becomes more like a toy, the plaything of a state. And when it’s a plaything, kids start playing with other kids. You end up ruining the entire system.<br /><br />The origin of this entire problem with the Super League is the inflationary effect that Manchester City and PSG have created across the whole of Europe because the rest of the clubs in Europe want money to compete with these guys. There’s a lot in play here but the future of European professional football is at risk. This is not a joke what is going on right now. And English fans need to know what every club thinks about this. Because the history of English football and its clubs is in danger. We need to be much more transparent about a Super League</p>

Because when we have clubs being financed by states, then that has an impact on salaries. That means in other countries with more strict economic controls like Spain and Germany clubs cannot actually ask the state for extra financing to pay those salaries.<br /><br />Organisations and institutions have a responsibility to redistribute the wealth that we generate. All of us, the Spanish league, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. I don’t think we are helping football in any way if we generate wealth and it just goes straight back to the big clubs. In the end instead of having 12 Ferraris, they have 15. We’re dealing with major clubs generating a huge amount of money. So our aim is to redistribute that wealth<br /><br /><b>[Tebas additionally fired criticism at the idea of an expanded Club World Cup]</b> Having been re-elected, I am very critical of the Club World Cup. An organisation like <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> is supposed to be a regulatory body. They draft the different calendars and when we need to play. Sadly, from organising World Cups, they are now talking about Club World Cups and having that every two years. That is not an option because it would change the status quo. This can’t happen. A few weeks ago <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> was talking about how much would be paid if they went to China.

Let’s imagine the two teams from Argentina <b>[who will take part in the Club World Cup]</b>. It’s 40 or 50m from a tournament such as this. This would have an impact on the Argentinian Super League.

It is a hypothesis that we do not contemplate. We want to end it, probably behind closed doors. And it is curious, by chance, that the clubs that want to end the season here are the ones from the bottom of the League, the ones that are fighting not to be relegated. I can assure you that no major nor mid-season championships intend to cancel the season, whoever talks about this does so for personal interests<br /><br />Of all the different scenarios we have been looking at with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to go back to competing, the most probable ones are 28 May, 6 June or 28 June.

I hope that date can be confirmed and we would like the game to be the Seville derby, kicking off at 10pm<br /><br /><b>[Argentine trio <a href="ever-banega.html">Ever Banega</a>, <a href="lucas-ocampos.html">Lucas Ocampos</a> and Franco Vazquez as well as Dutch striker <a href="luuk-de-jong.html">Luuk de Jong</a> were pictured at a party alongside eight other people over the weekend]</b> Players are an example to society and should be careful with their actions. I call on all footballers to not act like this. We have to be very careful because a lot of people’s jobs are at stake. Safety is guaranteed at training grounds and matches but I’m worried about other places and parties like this. We should all be very cautious</p>

  <p><b>[Tebas wants <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> 2020-21 to start on September 12]</b> We’ll start, God willing, on June 11. Let’s hope Madrid and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> go to Phase Two. There are more than 130 people at <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> working so that everything can be done, in a new way: travelling, organisation, everything. We’re prepared and the important thing will be the day we finish the competition. The next will start on September 12<br /><br />It’s important that the disaster of the pandemic does not generate an economic disaster afterwards. This is a study to see who believes in the sports industry and who doesn’t. It will be important to see who our allies are. Returning does not mean we are not going to lose millions. Our clubs will lose at least €700m and that will have to be recovered. In that push, it will be good to see who has believed in the industry from the start.<br /><br />Tonight, we will have tests so that, at an audiovisual level, the viewer can choose two images: the real one, and the one with the fans and virtual sound. In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, they’ve chosen virtual sound with great success and we’re working on providing that option. We want to give the fans the alternatives: silence, or virtual stands</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> confirm schedule for remainder of the season]</b> Supporters in the stands make football complete but now, due to reasons beyond their control, they won’t be able to be there. We have created this initiative to help fans be a part of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>’s return and also as an opportunity for them to show their support for the heroes of the COVID-19 pandemic. We want them to feel close to their team, even if they cannot be in the stadiums cheering them on, and for players to feel the support of their fans</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> chief Javier Tebas is looking forward to the resumption of activities in the Spanish top-flight, but he had stern words for the players who have been caught flouting coronavirus lockdown and distancing rules]</b> We hope we don’t have to reach that extreme, but if players cannot stop going to barbecues or parties, we will not have a choice. We have shown trust in the players, so please pay back that trust and do not break it. Breaking the rules does not only damage <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, but people’s health in general. If we can get 10% or 15% <b>[of the capacity]</b>, we would be happy. The pandemic is on a sharp decline. The return to stadiums would have to be coordinated by the ministry for health and the Sports Council, and it is obviously not going to be the whole stadium. If we can get 10%, 15% this season we would be very happy. It would be part of that ‘normality’; it is important that fans start to return</p>
