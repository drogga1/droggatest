  <p><b>[Rodrigo Riquelme: <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> academy star ready to step into <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s shoes]</b> At first I was a little nervous but I imagine it is normal. Then, he <b>[<a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>]</b> reassured me by telling me to play as I would in training and that I was going to create a goal. Debuting in this stadium with all these people and being from the academy is a dream for me. I hope there are more opportunities and I will work for them<br /><br /><b>[<a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Ruiz</a>, however, is sure that <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a> will only reach his full potential if he is allowed to embrace his superb turn of pace and be played on the left-hand side]</b> I have had conversations with national selectors and I told them that what I think is best is that he plays from the wing. In this way, his diagonal runs, preferably from the left, end in him shooting or passing to a team-mate. His change of pace is brutal and is something that could differentiate him with others in his age group. He has speed, change of pace and ability to overpower an opponent in one-on-one situations. On the right wing, he can do it but he will lose a little. The left is his best position. Is he like <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>? The Frenchman I consider more a second striker. <a href="juninho.html">Juninho</a>? The Brazilian was lighter, but <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a> has a fast pace change, and Juno didn’t have that power</p>
