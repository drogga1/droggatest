  <p><b>[Captain Darijo Srna was understandably overjoyed after Croatia secured automatic qualification for Euro 2016]</b> Today Croatian players are heroes who are doing everything they can for their country. Tonight <b>[Tuesday]</b>, it’s time to celebrate. We are proud that we will listen to the Croatian anthem in France at Euro 2016. We have a number excellent Croatian players and I am not afraid about our future.</p>

  <p><b>[Darijo Srna flew back to Croatia for his father’s funeral and there were doubts over whether he would return to the squad]</b> It’s a very difficult moment for me and my family. I just have to say thank to everybody. This is my first appearance in front of the media after the match against Turkey and I just have to say thank you to all my friends, my family, my team-mates, for all the support since I heard the news after the match.<br /><br />It my father’s last wish that I be here at the Euros. Everything in his life was just for me to win as much as possible with the Croatian football team, so I went back to my house in Metkovic, and they told me that his wish was for me to here at the Euros with Croatia and have as much success as possible with the national team<br /><br /><b>[When the subject was raised again]</b> I think we have talked enough about my father’s death. I am here and I am focused on tomorrow’s match against the Czech Republic. I am the captain and I am here. When I got married, I flew the next night to play against Austria. So I’m here for my national team.<br /><br />Maybe we are a better team than the generation from 1998. But I’m not sure we can get to second or third pace or to the final - we are a good team, with good players, good technical staff and good supporters, we play good football, leave our heart on the pitch and try to make our supporters happy</p>

I adore him. Although he has improved a lot, we have not yet seen all he can give. But we will. He is the future of Madrid. He needs time, as just three years ago, he left Dinamo Zagreb to play at Inter and then Real</p>
