  <p><b>[Valencia midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia confident his former teammate <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> will surprise fans once he’s back out on the pitch]</b> I’m not worried about Paul. He’s shown, previously, that he’s a great footballer who knows how to do great things. We know football; once you’re not on the pitch as much, or if you’re injured, or if your routine drops, then people can automatically start to forget you. Football has always been the same, but knowing him very well on football terms, and on a human level, he’s someone who will always excel. He’ll always surprise spectators because he has this strength of character, and this mental force. He’s got everything going for him</p>

  <p><b>[Why Geoffrey Kondogbia is not the man to solve <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> worries]</b> didn’t realise the noise that had been made in Italy about my signing. I wasn’t ready for all that and didn’t like that kind of pressure</p>
