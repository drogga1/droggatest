<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Will the goalkeeper die out under Pep Guardiola?]</b> The modern-day game has demanded that the goalkeeper be more of a footballer first than a goalkeeper. You’re touching the ball approximately seven more times with the feet than with the hands. It’s no longer just a shot-stopper. It’s no longer someone who just comes to claim the balls. It’s what you do when you have it that becomes so critical.<br /><br /><b>[Ederson with Pep’s guidance is obliterating the distinction between goalkeeper and outfield player]</b> The standard of player he has in front of him dictates that he is not seeing the volume of shots that perhaps a Ben Foster or someone like that is. The style of play is a massive part of it<br /><br />We’re not just talking about playing a 15-20 yard pass to an outside back or something like that. Now we’re talking about slipping balls into a midfielder, we’re talking about bypassing the first wave of attack and putting it into a forward’s feet. Now the range of passing and the accuracy of passing is critical<br /><br />Nowadays with the style of play, the speed of play and the demands of the position, the goalkeeper - it’s essential that he’s great with both feet. If you look in the Premier League and the top leagues around the world, if you mis-hit the ball and give up possession, the calibre of player these days is so high that if there’s a turnover in your own defensive third, often it’s resulting in a shot on goal. Then you’re dealing with something else<br /><br />As a coach you have to incorporate your goalkeeper into the team play. You’re coming back to the total football philosophy of the Dutch. Frans Hoek, the Dutch national goalkeeping coach, has for many years has been saying that the goalkeeper has to be the 11th field player<br /><br />The positional demands have meant that all players have had to evolve. I’ve even seen coaches take a goalkeeper out of the goal and put a field player in there and play as an extra sweeper with gloves on. There will be more evolution as the game moves forward</p>
