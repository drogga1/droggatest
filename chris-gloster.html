  <p><b>[USMNT U-20s face dangerous Honduras side with place in Concacaf final on the line]</b> I think the challenge with Honduras is just going to be the physicality. Obviously it’s going to be a fight, because they’re also fighting for a World Cup spot. We played them in Under-17 qualifying and I remember some of these players that are with them right now. Our mentality has to be staying focused defensively, because they’re going to try and come at us, but also they don’t want to concede, so I think at times they’ll want to sit back. Our mentality has to be to keep going at them. After we score one goal, act like it’s 0-0 and keep going at them.</p>

  <p><b>[Beating Mexico the ultimate prize for USMNT U-20s]</b> It’s not even about lifting the trophy at the end, it’s about playing Mexico and winning that game. Everyone is ready for that game. All I’ve been hearing since we got here is ‘I want a USA-Mexico final’. As soon as USA-Mexico steps on the field it’s just so much anger and fight and motivation just to beat each other. Forget about the trophy, or first place, it’s just about beating Mexico.<br /><br />I just need to be physical with Diego Lainez. If I just keep my head in the game and focus on him and what I need to do, it’s going to be a good matchup. I’m excited for that matchup. I’m not shying away from it just because he’s a good player. I have respect for him, he’s an amazing player, don’t get me wrong, but I’m waiting for the matchup</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Chris Gloster?]</b> It was really tough because before I started realizing I wanted to play in Europe they were giving me a lot of opportunities to train with the first team and with the USL. I even made my USL debut, played 85 minutes, and it was tough for me and my family because that club formed me into the player I am now. I grew up around that club. The first game I watched was at Red Bull Arena. You always want to play in your hometown and in front of your friends and family. It was tough but I realized I needed to go to Europe.<br /><br /><b>[On Steve Cherundolo]</b> I hear about him every day. They’re always talking about Cherundolo and what a good player he was and how comfortable he was at the club<br /><br />Germany is a totally different style of play. It’s more physical, harder, more demanding, and I think that’s where I get my confidence from. Confidence is key and being in Germany, and playing with older guys, that has given me a lot of confidence<br /><br />I’ve heard all these things about how the U.S. can never find that certain left back to hold the position, be up and down, attacking and defending. Hearing that stuff, and seeing where I am now, I’ve just got to keep grinding and keep working and hopefully I’ll be able to mesh into it and shine and show myself and show people that I can be that left back</p>
