  <p><b>[Former Roma centre-back Leandro Castan has revealed <a href="radja-nainggolan.html">Radja Nainggolan</a> used to leave the club dressing room to smoke with the assistant manager]</b> He arrived from <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> and I knew little about him at the time. But, right on his first match, he would tackle an opponent with class before kick starting an attacking move, then I knew what calibre of player he was. He’s a fine player, but unfortunately he’d get into a lot of controversy. When he was at Roma, he’d leave the dressing room to have a smoke with the assistant manager, he did what he pleased and wouldn’t care what people would think of it. But he would then go and deliver on the pitch, where it matters. It was great to play alongside him<br /><br /><b>[Castan, meanwhile, believes his current club will struggle to hold on to young star Talles Magno, who has even attracted some initial interest from Roma]</b> He <b>[Talles]</b> has a strong mentality, and that’s a virtue that must be praised. Some people at Roma have asked me about him, but then the director found him to be quite expensive! I’m sure he’ll be leaving for Europe sooner or later</p>
