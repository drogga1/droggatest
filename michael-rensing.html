  <p><b>[Michael Rensing says <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> Need To Look Forward Not Back]</b> We can’t change the past. We’re looking to the future now. It’s a chance to haul ourselves out of this rut. A decent result in Lisbon would not only throw the door to the last eight wide open, it would be a boost, giving us plenty of energy and confidence for the Bundesliga<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> won’t be taking their Portuguese opponents lightly after seeing them finish just a point behind <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in their group.

In hindsight, I have got to say that I miscalculated because, the way things are now, these clubs would have been very interesting. I am feeling stronger than ever before. I am noticing that I have improved in many areas</p>
