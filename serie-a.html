  <p><b>[Marcello Nicchi waded into the debate around racism in Italian football that reared its head again when <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> was abused by <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> fans during Inter’s 2-1 victory on September 1]</b> There are procedures in place and they need to be applied, as set out by the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a>, to shut down certain sections of the stadium. We referees have a lot of responsibility on our shoulders to deal with the game but it’s important here to clear the air and state the situation with absolute certainty: you cannot dump this problem on the referees. The referees will not change their attitude in this area<br /><br /><b>[Nicchi said Serie A clubs have the resources they need to take stronger action]</b> The most important thing is not to underestimate the problem. I feel racists should be identified immediately, stopped and put in jail. It would serve as a deterrent, I am sure of it. There are dozens and dozens of CCTV cameras inside stadiums now, not to mention observers from the league and the police. Even the local council could get involved. We know full well who is in the stadium, who is leading the chants. All we need is the genuine desire to take action and it can be done. I also want to point out that the players insulted must never feel alone. We show full solidarity with those players who were shamefully abused. Evidently, we need exemplary punishment. Let’s get the first person to hurl racist abuse at a black player, throw him in prison and see what happens then. The time has come to take serious action</p>

It’s a problem that we have not done enough to combat over the years. Images of players being racially abused in Italian football have been viewed and discussed all around the world this season and that shames us all.<br /><br />No individual should ever be subjected to racist abuse - inside or outside of football - and we can no longer stay silent on this issue or wait for it to magically disappear. Driven by the clubs, positive conversations have been held in recent weeks with Lega Serie A, <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> and international experts on how to tackle and eradicate this issue from the game.<br /><br />We, the undersigned clubs, are united by our desire for serious change and Lega Serie A has stated its intention to lead the way by delivering a comprehensive and robust Serie A anti-racism policy, stricter new laws and regulations and a plan for educating those within the game about the scourge of racism. We don’t have any more time to waste. We must now act with speed, with purpose and with unity and we call on you, the fans, to support us in this vitally important endeavour. Yours sincerely</p>

With regards to the possible completion of the remaining Serie A and Coppa Italia matches, Lega Serie A will only consider the resumption of sporting activity when health conditions allow it, adhering, as it has always done, to government decrees and taking into primary consideration the protection of the health of the players and all those involved. In facing the different scenarios, which are still uncertain, Lega Serie A - with the participation of club representatives - will continue to analyse the impact and consequences of Covid-19 on medical, economic, regulatory, sporting and risk-assessment levels for the clubs and Lega Serie A itself in the coming days</p>

  <p><b>[Italian Players’ Association slam ‘discriminatory and illogical’ training centres ban]</b> The AIC is perplexed and surprised by the government’s decision on resuming sport in Italy. We consider the idea discriminatory and illogical to let individual sporting disciplines enter training grounds, but not professional football - or other team sport - players to undergo individual training in the same way. This rule will, if anything, make the risk even greater rather than contain it! A professional athlete needs this phase of training after such a long break in order to avoid injuries and be ready to start training in groups from May 18. We don’t see how running in a sports arena built for this purpose is less dangerous than running down the street. We hope the government will quickly intervene to eliminate the evident distortions that derive from the application of the decree marked April 26.</p>
