  <p><b>[Meet Mukhairi Ajmal - The Malaysia wonderkid who idolises <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> and aims to shine alongside Luqman Hakim]</b> My father was a midfielder, so maybe that subconsciously influenced my preference too!<br /><br /><b>[Upon graduating at the end of 2018, he waited for an offer from his state team Pahang which never arrived, but in the end was given an offer by PKNP, which he gladly accepted]</b> Maybe Pahang overlooked me because I went to school out of state. So my family suggested that I tried my luck somewhere else.<br /><br />I was then told that <b>[PKNP coach]</b> Abu Bakar Fadzim was interested in me, and he could get me playing time in the Super League. Needless to say, I was thrilled because I had only been targeting a place in a President Cup team (U-21). I packed up my things and left immediately for Manjung to join their training, where I signed a 1+1 contract<br /><br /><b>[He made headlines when making his Super League debut against PKNS at age 17 years, three months and 16 days]</b> I realised that at the top level, you need to read the game more and your decision-making need to be quick because young players would lose out on the strengths aspect. As someone who liked to have the ball, that was going to be more difficult. Up until then I had only been wearing decently-priced footwear, so when I got my first pay I went and got myself a pair of Nike Mercurial. They didn’t last long though<br /><br /><b>[One of them is the country’s most exciting prospects; <a href="luqman-hakim.html">Luqman Hakim Shamsudin</a> who also happens to be one of the best players he likes to play with, as well as a good friend]</b> I first met him as a primary school boy, and the next time we met again was after I graduated. By then he was a changed player; he was much quicker on the ball and he knew how to utilise that speed. As teammates he also knows what I like to do; sending through balls to the strikers, and having someone as quick as he is on the same side makes my job easy. I am so grateful that he is with me at Selangor, and my chemistry with him is something I want to improve upon. Off the pitch, we’re good friends too, and banter a lot<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his favourite player, the midfielder admitted to being a big fan of World Cup winner <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>, who plays for his favourite club, Arsenal]</b> I just love the way he plays, especially his through balls, which is something that I try to emulate. His one-by-ones against goalkeepers are amazing. Whatever people say about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I don’t care. I love watching <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I’m such a big fan of his. He had fallen out of favour under Unai <b>[Emery]</b>, but it’s good to see him receiving playing time under <b>[new manager Mikel]</b> Arteta<br /><br />I hope the 2020 season can be resumed, even if matches are played without fans. I’m getting rusty and restless already. Sure, the lawn of the house is big enough, but having to train separately instead of together with my teammates is kind of demoralising. Some of the guys who live with their family have even started cooking and delivering food to pass the time, but I doubt my cooking is fit for selling.</p>
