  <p><b>[Robbie Savage, who played alongside Speed for Wales on many occasions]</b> The world has lost a great man in Gary speed I’m devastated spoke to him yesterday morning why ! Why. Why !! I’ll miss him so much x He come to watch strictly 3/4 weeks ago I high fived him in the front row he loved the show ,he loved life he loved his family ! Devastated.<br /><br />I spoke to him yesterday and he was in high spirits. I just can’t believe it. He was my mate and he’s gone. He’s left two gorgeous kids behind. Gary was <b>[a professional]</b>. He was one of the fittest guys. He looked after his body. He was a great team-mate, a great manager. He was joking yesterday <b>[about Robbie being on Strictly Come Dancing]</b>, saying don’t get a two off <b>[judge]</b> Craig <b>[Revel Horwood]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Savage hails Chelsea’s signing of instrumental N’Golo Kante]</b> Yes, you can see some of the prices for other players and it was only £32 million for a guy who was instrumental in a 5000/1 side to win the Premier League <b>[and went on to win it]</b>.<br /><br />He was a huge influence <b>[at Leicester]</b>, huge. His protection for <b>[Wes]</b> Morgan, <b>[Robert]</b> Huth and the full-backs was great and as Leicester concede more goals this year, it goes to show the benefits on the Chelsea side. I still believe that <b>[Riyad]</b> Mahrez was the best player in the Premier League last year, due to his assists and goals. Leicester aren’t scoring goals this year as well - did Kante offer anything in that way? I think he allowed those forward players to be more expansive because they knew he’d be here, there and everywhere. So they have missed him and I am surprised at how much they have missed him. It is incredible really to think what everyone now says about Kante, and it is rightly so, but it is surprising that they have missed him so, so much</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage thinks that Diego Costa has made a huge impact for Chelsea this season]</b> If Chelsea lost Diego Costa, who would be their replacement for him? I think he has been so instrumental. He is scoring goals and I just love watching Diego Costa. If I could pay to watch most players in the Premier League, then I would pay to watch him because he works so hard. He scores goals, he’s energetic, he loves a tackle, he’s controversial. Everything I like watching in a player, I just think that, whereas before, he would get frustrated and leave a boot in, he is not doing that. He is just concentrating on closing people down, scoring goals, working hard and I think it shows. The game against West Brom was the one, McAuley had the ball in the corner, he pressured him into a mistake and then that finish was sensational.<br /><br />Do I think he is the best in the league? I would go with Aguero. If they both went on the market, who would Barcelona and Real Madrid try to sign? I would say that they would both go for Aguero ahead of Costa. That’s just my opinion, I would say Aguero is closely followed by Sanchez and Costa - and I have paid my own money to watch Costa<br /><br /><b>[On Michy Batshuayi]</b> He’s not had an opportunity because of the form of Diego Costa, has he? If Costa’s form has been so impressive and you have to play in a 3-4-3 then there’s no room for him really. Costa’s form has given him no chance, so we don’t yet know what he can produce on a regular basis in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage sounds transfer warning to Liverpool &amp; Arsenal]</b> I’d say Mahrez is worth £75m. <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk has gone for £75m and he’s a defender. Mahrez was PFA Player of the Year two years ago and he’s won the Premier League so why is he not worth £75m? The hardest thing to do is to create chances and score goals in the league</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Leicester’s refusal to let Riyad Mahrez leave for Manchester City was churlish]</b> Riyad Mahrez will be in turmoil after being denied his dream move to Manchester City - and I don’t blame him. No disrespect to Leicester, who are perfectly entitled to hold Mahrez to his contract, but he has outgrown them. Are Leicester ever going to win the title again? No - and they won’t win a trophy of any kind if they keep picking weakened teams in the cup competitions. Are they ever going to offer him Champions League football again? Probably not. Do they have much to gain from keeping a disaffected player at the club? Not in my opinion. He’s seen other star players being allowed to fly the nest for good money - so why are Leicester demanding a king’s ransom for Mahrez? A move to City would almost guarantee him winning more trophies, possibly including the Champions League, and a chance to play for Pep Guardiola, arguably the best coach on the planet.<br /><br />After everything he has done for Leicester - a £460,000 snip who is now worth more than 100 times as much - surely there comes a point where it is churlish to stand in the way of his ambition. What sort of mentality is he going to be in for the rest of the season? Leicester are not going to finish in the top four and they are not going to go down, so I don’t understand why they were not prepared to let him go for £60m, which is what City were believed to be offering. Is £59.5m not a big enough profit to make on a player who was a huge part in delivering that title miracle in 2016? In my opinion, Mahrez is worth £75m - but if he wants to go, he’s only worth as much as Leicester can get for him</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has been warned that Manchester United may be the only Premier League option available]</b> If Gareth Bale leaves Real Madrid this summer - there are suggestions he may not fit into returning coach Zinedine Zidane’s long-term plans - then he could be coming back to England. United would be his most realistic hope of a ticket back to the Premier League. Manchester City don’t need him, Tottenham can’t afford his wages with a new stadium to pay for, Chelsea could be under a transfer ban and he probably wouldn’t go to Arsenal as a former Spurs player. That doesn’t leave Bale with many other options in England.</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is the most undervalued player of the last 20 years]</b> I’m going to say it’s <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He’s scored 105 goals in all competitions, 13 trophies, three goals in Champions League finals, including the spectacular overhead kick against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He’s also got one in a penalty shootout. Compare that to the great <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, 49 goals, six trophies - that worldie against Bayer Leverkusen, his only goal in a Champions League final - but it was a worldie. <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, 56 goals, seven trophies and then the great <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, 104 goals and three trophies. So <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> has got more goals and more trophies than those three. So, for me, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> has to be the most underappreciated player at any club, by the fans in the last 20 years</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage pops up to ask Matt Hancock a question at daily coronavirus briefing]</b> It is mental health awareness week and we all know how important all sport is as a contributor to achieving healthy minds and bodies. Why, therefore, is it that in published guidelines by governing bodies that junior tennis players, golfers and athletes are able to receive one-on-one coaching sessions but young people who play the working class game of football are currently not allowed to?</p>
