  <p><b>[Robbie Savage, who played alongside Speed for Wales on many occasions]</b> The world has lost a great man in Gary speed I’m devastated spoke to him yesterday morning why ! Why. Why !! I’ll miss him so much x He come to watch strictly 3/4 weeks ago I high fived him in the front row he loved the show ,he loved life he loved his family ! Devastated.<br /><br />I spoke to him yesterday and he was in high spirits. I just can’t believe it. He was my mate and he’s gone. He’s left two gorgeous kids behind. Gary was <b>[a professional]</b>. He was one of the fittest guys. He looked after his body. He was a great team-mate, a great manager. He was joking yesterday <b>[about Robbie being on Strictly Come Dancing]</b>, saying don’t get a two off <b>[judge]</b> Craig <b>[Revel Horwood]</b>.</p>

He’s proven he can get into team, hold his place down, be one of United’s best players this season and missed when injured!</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is the most undervalued player of the last 20 years]</b> I’m going to say it’s <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He’s scored 105 goals in all competitions, 13 trophies, three goals in Champions League finals, including the spectacular overhead kick against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He’s also got one in a penalty shootout. Compare that to the great <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, 49 goals, six trophies - that worldie against Bayer Leverkusen, his only goal in a Champions League final - but it was a worldie. <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, 56 goals, seven trophies and then the great <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, 104 goals and three trophies. So <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> has got more goals and more trophies than those three. So, for me, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> has to be the most underappreciated player at any club, by the fans in the last 20 years</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Savage pops up to ask Matt Hancock a question at daily coronavirus briefing]</b> It is mental health awareness week and we all know how important all sport is as a contributor to achieving healthy minds and bodies. Why, therefore, is it that in published guidelines by governing bodies that junior tennis players, golfers and athletes are able to receive one-on-one coaching sessions but young people who play the working class game of football are currently not allowed to?</p>
