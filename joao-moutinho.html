  <p><b>[Monaco midfielder Joao Moutinho has said that he is open to a move to the Premier League]</b> I have always said that one day I would like to play in the Premier League. But for the moment, I’m happy here at Monaco. I’m going to continue to give my best until the day we decide to part company, but today that’s not an issue.<br /><br />There were only rumours, I didn’t speak to anyone. And, on my part, I had no desire to go. Ligue 1 remains our principal objective, but we’re also capable of being competitive on the European scene. We want to win the league and go far in the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Los Angeles FC selects Joao Moutinho with first overall pick in MLS draft]</b> It’s a roller coaster of emotions to be honest. It’s something I never thought about when I came here. To be the first pick in a great group of players is an honor for me.</p>

  <p><b>[LAFC identity coming into focus after busy MLS draft]</b> I played like three or four positions at Akron and I think I did pretty well. I’ll play whatever the coach wants me to, and if he doesn’t want me to play I won’t. But I’ll be ready every single game.</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Moutinho poised for breakout rookie season with LAFC]</b> It was an easy transition <b>[to the pro level]</b> I’d say, because the vets have been helping me a lot. I think the team is getting along nicely, and I think the team is very cohesive now and we’re ready for our first game.<br /><br />I knew that America was the land of opportunity and coming here was going to be good for me. I definitely wanted to go pro some day, but I know it’s a risk. It’s always better to have a plan B if a soccer career doesn’t work out. I needed to make a change and Akron gave me that chance<br /><br />After a few games I noticed that the teams didn’t really try to play the ball on the ground. They would kick it up there and try to get it by strength. So I was really happy that I went to Akron, because that’s not the way we play. We tried to pass it around, tried to get to the final third with combinations. I definitely went to the right school<br /><br />On the pitch it’s 11v11, so it’s going to be the same thing I’ve been doing for years. This is what I’ve always wanted so I can’t wait to play there</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Moutinho has admitted he missed out on the opportunity to previously play for Everton and Tottenham]</b> Since I started playing as a professional, I have wanted to play in England. I could have joined Everton or Tottenham before, but things didn’t work out well to come over here. The Premier League is the best in the world. It is fascinating because of all the teams, the atmosphere and stadiums. The football is of course a little more aggressive, there is more contact but I like this. I am small and sometimes I don’t go to the contact but the players need to be intelligent and know what they can and can’t do<br /><br />If I get rid of the beard I am 22! I like to joke around a lot. We enjoy what we do and, for me, playing football is the best work in the world. I don’t know how many players or boys want to be in my position. I try to live my life with happiness and with a smile on my face. I try to do my best. Do I think about the future? If I can do another 20 years, I would do 20 years, but I’m sure it’s not possible. When I feel that the club wants me, and has a good project, that is what gives me a lot of energy to continue</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Moutinho: It doesn’t matter if it’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> play to win]</b> We will try to win. It doesn’t matter whether it is Saturday’s opponents <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> or <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, we know that if we compete 100 per cent we have the possibility to win. That is our mentality. That is the kind of team that we are<br /><br />I don’t like to lose, no matter what I am playing. Football, tennis, head tennis, no matter what. If I am playing something, I am playing to win. If I am not playing to win, I don’t want to play. There needs to be something that moves you, something that inspires you. I think it is good for the spirit to have that mentality. You cannot be different when it comes to the small things. Play to win something every day. If you live like that every day then, of course, at the weekend you are going to be winning<br /><br />I do what I need to do to stay fit. I train well. I eat well. I drink water and hydration drinks. I rest when I need to rest. I come to training every day as if it is the first day. They are small things but they make a difference. I work a lot in the gym on injury prevention. This is important too. You have to believe in this work. You can’t just do it because you do it. You have to recognise that if you do this it is good for your body and it will give you something extra that will then help you<br /><br />I defend like a man who likes to work too because I know that football is not just about what you do on the ball. A team doesn’t have the ball for 90 minutes. It is about the recoveries. I do my best to do that and help the team any way I can. If that’s a pass, an assist, a tackle or even if it’s only running, I do it for the team. The defenders attack and the attackers defend. That’s how it is here. We play like a team, that’s the most important thing. The individual aspect comes afterwards</p>
