      <td>Moutinho, one of the most respected midfielders in Europe, arrived at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> as part of the Rodriguez deal. And while the South American left for Real after a year, Moutinho remained in the French top flight, establishing himself as a key figure under <a href="leonardo-jardim.html">Leonardo Jardim</a> as <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> broke Paris-Saint Germain’s <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> monopoly. After five years with the principality club, Moutinho joined newly-promoted <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in 2018, appearing in all 38 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games in the club’s first top-tier season in six years. Having been named Wolves’ Player of the Season, Moutinho signed a new deal in November to keep him at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Molineux</a> until 2022.</td>

  <p><b>[Joao Moutinho: It doesn’t matter if it’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> play to win]</b> We will try to win. It doesn’t matter whether it is Saturday’s opponents <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> or <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, we know that if we compete 100 per cent we have the possibility to win. That is our mentality. That is the kind of team that we are<br /><br />I don’t like to lose, no matter what I am playing. Football, tennis, head tennis, no matter what. If I am playing something, I am playing to win. If I am not playing to win, I don’t want to play. There needs to be something that moves you, something that inspires you. I think it is good for the spirit to have that mentality. You cannot be different when it comes to the small things. Play to win something every day. If you live like that every day then, of course, at the weekend you are going to be winning<br /><br />I do what I need to do to stay fit. I train well. I eat well. I drink water and hydration drinks. I rest when I need to rest. I come to training every day as if it is the first day. They are small things but they make a difference. I work a lot in the gym on injury prevention. This is important too. You have to believe in this work. You can’t just do it because you do it. You have to recognise that if you do this it is good for your body and it will give you something extra that will then help you<br /><br />I defend like a man who likes to work too because I know that football is not just about what you do on the ball. A team doesn’t have the ball for 90 minutes. It is about the recoveries. I do my best to do that and help the team any way I can. If that’s a pass, an assist, a tackle or even if it’s only running, I do it for the team. The defenders attack and the attackers defend. That’s how it is here. We play like a team, that’s the most important thing. The individual aspect comes afterwards</p>
