If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there. That’s true for the United States, but also all the other countries that would like to organise a World Cup. It is the same for the fans, and the journalists, of course. It is the World Cup. They should be able to attend the event, whatever their nationality is. But let’s hope it does not happen</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgaria vs England racism shame: <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> vows to ‘wage war’ on offenders &amp; defends sanctions]</b> There were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory. The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent. The rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views.<br /><br />As a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, in close cooperation with the FARE network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium - a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.<br /><br /><a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour - the most severe punishment level in the game. Believe me, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve.<br /><br />More broadly, the football family - everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans - needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society. Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress</p>

We have already some proposals. But it’s too early to speak publicly about it. It will happen in March. The statutes will be changed. And then a week later we can do it<br /><br /><b>[Ceferin says that he believes that the rise of racist incidents is not directly related to football or its supporters, but rather a surge in nationalism throughout Europe]</b> They don’t care about football. They care about their own idiotic ideology. And that’s why football is a reflection of society. It brings the worst to the stands. I still think that 99 per cent of football fans are not racist. But those idiots ruin everything. Then this attention is what they care about. They don’t care about football. Even if the players walk off, they will enjoy it. Only the real football fans would suffer. If we stop the match they enjoy it. They don’t care.<br /><br />Do you think those idiots in Bulgaria care about the football match? They left the football match after 10 minutes. Do you think fans in Croatia who draw a swastika on the pitch care about football? No, they don’t. They are exactly like the Nazi Party in the 30s or the last century. And if we say we can’t do anything anymore then we should stop doing anything.<br /><br />I’ve said before, it cannot be solved only by football. Governing bodies have to be helped by the government because for me if you are chanting or showing Nazi signs, that’s a criminal act. I speak with our colleagues, with my colleagues from the football federations <b>[across Europe]</b>. The other day I spoke with two or three of the very big countries in western Europe and they are worried. They say that 30% of the world probably supports the extreme right? So it’s a frightening, frightening situation. Of course there are two ways of looking at it: One is, yes, we <b>[football]</b> attract it. The second is that we can use football to do things because we have power. I don’t run away from that. We have power because if we do something it’s always big</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> chief Aleksander Ceferin hints at racism reforms]</b> Things need to change. We must begin by applying the rules we already have. That would be a good starting point. That means applying the three-step procedure. We must not be afraid to do so. Everywhere. No exceptions. In the last three seasons, the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> disciplinary bodies have imposed 73 partial stadium closures and ordered 39 matches to be played behind closed doors following incidents of discrimination. That shows that we are doing what is currently in our power to do. But it also shows what a serious problem it is, and that we need to do more. More, and perhaps differently. So that we can be proud of ourselves once again<br /><br />Football is, above all, a celebration of life, community and unity. It’s an exchange. It’s about sharing. The problem is not on the pitch, where diversity is greater than in any other sport and probably any other part of society. The problem is in our societies. And this has to stop<br /><br />When purpose over profit becomes profit over purpose, it is time to raise the alarm. Football is not simply a business like any other. It has a history, tradition and structure that must be respected. The football pyramid is delicate and must not be knocked off balance. Certain projects, some devised on other continents with the backing of governing bodies, are particularly worrying. Supporters are not consumers. Or customers. They are supporters. Players are not machines. Or products, or pawns. They are players. No football administrator, no matter the size of the ego, should think we are the stars of the game. We are only the guardians of the game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> president Ceferin certain Reds will be crowned <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions]</b> I see no way for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to stay untitled. If the championship resumes, they will almost certainly win it - theoretically, it has not yet reached the guaranteed level, but it is practically close. However, if it could not be played, it would also be necessary to announce the results in some way and find some key on how the champions should be determined. And, of course, again I do not see a scenario in which that would not be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I understand that fans will be disappointed if it happens in an empty stadium or even at the green table <b>[by officials if the season is avoided]</b>, but I believe they will win the title one way or another<br /><br /><b>[Ceferin is ‘optimistic’ that <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> schedules will be completed]</b> I’m an optimist. I am optimistic that we will see the conclusion of the Spanish championship, I am optimistic that we will see the conclusion of the Italian one, and I am optimistic in general. Of course, I cannot guarantee anything, I cannot promise anything. It will all depend on the situation in the individual countries, it will all depend on whether the circumstances are good enough for you to avoid endangering anyone by playing football</p>

  <p><b>[Ceferin is keen for European leagues to be played to a finish]</b> The priority is the health of fans, players and managers. I am an optimist by nature, I believe there are options that can allow us to start tournaments and complete them. We may have to play without spectators, but I think the most important thing is playing games. In such hard times it would bring people happiness and a certain sense of normality even if the matches will only be on TV.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fai.html">FAI</a> may be unable to avail of €4.3m of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> money]</b> Our sport is facing an unprecedented challenge brought about by the COVID-19 crisis. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> wants to help its members to respond in ways that are appropriate to their specific circumstances. As a result, we have agreed that up to €4.3m per association, paid for the remainder of this season and next, as well as part of the investment funding, can be used as our members see fit to rebuild the football community.<br /><br />I believe this is a responsible decision to help as much as we can; and I am proud of the unity that football is showing throughout this crisis. Without doubt, football will be at the heart of life returning to normal. When that time comes, football must be ready to answer that call</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> president Aleksander Ceferin has welcomed the planned return of German football on May 16]</b> It is great news that the German authorities have agreed that the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> can return. This is a huge and positive step to bringing optimism back to people’s lives. It is the result of constructive dialogue and careful planning between the football authorities and politicians and I am confident that Germany will provide a shining example to all of us in how to bring football - with all its excitement, emotion and unpredictability - back into our lives. I wish everyone connected with this every success</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> chief Ceferin confident European season will be completed by August despite coronavirus]</b> We have an idea but we have to wait for the executive committee of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to confirm the dates. I can say that the European season will be finished, if everything is as it is now, in August. As things look now, I’m sure that we can finish the European season and this means <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competition. I think the majority of leagues will finish the season. The ones who will not, it’s their decision. But they will still have to play qualifiers if they want to participate in the European <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competition<br /><br />If you cannot play in your country, then you have to organise it at a neutral ground. I don’t see the reason why French authorities would not allow them to organise a match without spectators, but let’s see. It’s out of my power<br /><br />We’ve had conversations with nine cities and everything is set. With three cities, we have some issues. So we will discuss further. In principle, we will do it in 12 cities but if not, we are ready to do it in 10, nine or eight</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> could resume with play-offs before August 2]</b> We would first of all like to clarify that it is the competence of national associations to decide on the format of their domestic competitions, in particular by taking into account the circumstances and restrictive measures specific to the country. As mentioned by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> a few weeks ago, the French authorities’ decision to cancel the season was taken relatively early. Nevertheless, and provided that the national associations are able to coordinate with the competent national authorities a potential restart of domestic competition, August 2, 2020, would be an appropriate date to end the domestic competitions.</p>

  <p><b>[Champions League set to resume in August as Lisbon plays host to remainder of tournament]</b> I am delighted that we are able to resume almost all of our competitions. I am confident that we will not have to endure the fans’ absence for long and that they will be allowed into stadiums sooner rather than later. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> took a bold decision when it decided to postpone Euro 2020. But in doing so, we created the space which has allowed domestic club competitions across the continent to resume, where possible, and play to a conclusion. While the game has suffered huge difficulties as a result of the pandemic, those blows would have landed much harder if we had not shown leadership in those early days. The football community has worked together and shown tremendous unity during this unprecedented crisis. I would like to thank <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, our sister confederations, national associations, clubs, leagues, players and the relevant authorities for their continuous support and commitment and I am convinced that we come out of this crisis stronger and with closer links than ever before.</p>

But, in the future, we will have to adapt it, change some things. Maybe we should modernise, go next step but when it will happen I don’t think very soon. I don’t know if mistakes have been made, probably yes, everywhere mistakes have been made<br /><br />We’re thinking of improving <b>[FFP]</b>, modernising it and doing something more about the competitive balance.
