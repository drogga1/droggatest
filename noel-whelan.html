  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> He is a winner. He demands that from his players, he’s not coming here for his first opportunity and thinking I’ll finish fourth or fifth and that’s great, he is installing something into these players that they’ve been lacking when they’ve spent all this money.<br /><br />He is installing a winning mentality, attitude and character to these players, along with the talent they have, they are organised and are a dangerous side. He passes that enthusiasm and steeliness from his playing days to his players and you can see that</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> striker Noel Whelan believes <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could do worse that look to the second tier for inspiration, with there two players working under <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a> who would slot seamlessly into the fold at Emirates Stadium]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> don’t have a proper defensive midfielder or a top centre-back. If Phillips and Ben White were at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> they would improve them.<br /><br />They would walk into the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team. Phillips is a better midfielder than <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>, and White is a better centre-back than any of the ones they’ve got - <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>, Sokratis, <a href="rob-holding.html">Rob Holding</a>, Callum Chambers. He’s just as good on the ball as <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> and far better defensively. I’m surprised <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a> hasn’t played more for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Maybe he isn’t disciplined enough</p>

  <p><b>[Noel Whelan says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will be keen for <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> to join Leeds]</b> There is obviously interest from <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in Brewster and I’m sure there are a queue of clubs wanting to take him. But <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> have a good chance, definitely. A huge thing in Leeds’ favour is that <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a> is a great coach and <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> play in a similar way to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - build out from the back, press from the front, high energy, smooth passing combinations and an aggressive playing style. That’s how <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> signed Jack Harrison from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will be aware of that, and how Harrison has developed under <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will be keen for Brewster to join <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and learn under <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>. It’s probably in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s mind to send him to a team that play a similar style of football to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and that’s where <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> will fit the bill. The issue is how much game time he would have, as Patrick Bamford is the number one centre-forward at Leeds</p>
