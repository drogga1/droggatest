  <p><b>[Mason Greenwood has an incredible technique and natural ability to find the net]</b> Greenwood has 15 goals this season and for an 18-year-old, that is absolutely incredible. What I like about him most of all is he actually did his first interview with United’s in-house TV station and one of the questions was: ‘What is your favoured foot?’ And he is that good really that when you watch him, you do not know if he is left-footed, or right-footed. He is just a natural footballer and his finishing is just sensational. And what I really like about him is usually when young players come through like that, strikers tend to rely on their pace. And while he is quick, he just has an incredible technique and this natural ability to find the back of the net</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd attacking like Utd of old]</b> United have some very winnable games coming up and it all points to that final game of the season at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. United are certainly now on a fantastic unbeaten run, so they will really fancy putting the pressure on and I really do think it will come down to that game at the King Power on the final day of the season. And that would really be a great end to the campaign and really exciting<br /><br />There is a note of caution with United and one of the things that will concern <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is there are a few little defensive flaws in there at the moment. The way that Junior Stanislas turned into <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> when faced with <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> yesterday will be a cause for concern, particularly as <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> did not really cover himself in glory at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> a few weeks ago when <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> scored that goal</p>

  <p><b>[United have some very winnable games coming up and it all points to that final game of the season at Leicester]</b> <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> as well, there are question marks over him at the moment with the possibility of <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> coming in next year, De Gea beaten at his near post. So there are a few issues that will concern <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>. But in terms of going forward, United look like the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> of old. They just have such an exciting (attacking) quartet, while <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> has not hit full form yet and if he raises his game and settled down and keep fit, then United are really well placed for that final stretch</p>
