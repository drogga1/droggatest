  <p><b>[Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has defended the club’s decision to hand manager Arsene Wenger a two-year contract extension]</b> When you look at the world of football, and you think about the great candidates that there are - and there are many great coaching candidates in the world and Arsenal is a club that all of them would want to work for because of the things we represent in football - but when you look around and make that assessment, you don’t find any better candidates than Arsene Wenger.<br /><br />I think in football, the judgements are so black and white that often, if you don’t fire your manager, then you’re seen as being unambitious. I think that’s ludicrous. You don’t fire good people, you don’t fire people who are world-class, you don’t fire people who are driven to improve. What you do is work out how you can improve together and how you can move forward. That’s what this club is doing and we have a very clear ambition that we want to deliver it in<br /><br />I’m convinced that our fanbase will put the football club at the top of their priorities and will get behind this team. Together, we are much, much stronger than we are when we are arguing and trying to prove who’s right and who’s wrong. Let’s get behind the team, let’s get behind the club</p>

Again, at some point of course, we will have to transition to the era beyond <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and that is not a sentimental connection that we have, that is a connection that is driven by what is best for the football club … Arsene would not make this commitment, if he did not believe he could push this club forward</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal improved the quality and depth of their squad to end the summer transfer window stronger]</b> At the end of the window, reviewing all activity, we have once again improved the quality and depth of our squad.<br /><br />Everything is coloured by results…a positive performance at Liverpool would have coloured this transfer window very differently. We have had a poor start to the season but have the quality to turn it around and turn around performances and compete for the title. It is time to get back to what it is all about, the football. The manager and players know that the performance at Anfield was not good enough and they will be focused to put that right after the international break<br /><br /><b>[retaining the services of Sanchez and fellow contract rebel Mesut Ozil should actually be viewed as a positive]</b> A clear statement of our ambitions and should help refute suggestions we are just about the money.

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> chief executive Ivan Gazidis says the research <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> had done on the club’s young talent was one of the reasons for his appointment as the club’s new head coach]</b> What was really impressive was when you scratched the surface to go deeper and deeper and deeper<br /><br />If we were speaking about one of our young players, if we targeted <a href="ainsley-maitland-niles.html">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a> for example, Unai knows Ainsley. He’s watched him, he’s familiar with his patterns of play, his capabilities, he’s very excited about his potential and was able to talk about how excited he was to work with Ainsley, to develop him as a player<br /><br />Very specifically, when you asked the follow-up question and the follow-up question and the follow-up question, you’d get more and more depth about how exactly he would do that, exactly how him and his team would work with an individual player to develop them into the best player they can possibly be and also within the team dynamic<br /><br />There are a lot of platitudes in the game of football, a lot, and people can speak at a surface level very easily to sound confident and impressive. What’s impressive to me is when you scratch through that and you get deeply involved in what exactly they mean<br /><br /><b>[Gazidis, however, is under no illusions about the size of the task facing Emery, who won a domestic treble before leaving <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> The hard work starts right now. We are right into the transfer window of course, but we’re also into many other things such as how we’re going to integrate his team, how we think about pre-season planning, how the teams are going to work together<br /><br />There’s a lot of work to be done now to integrate this new team into our existing team. I know that we can do that successfully but it’s going to take hard work through the summer. There’s been obviously a lot of question marks as we’ve gone through this period of transition over recent weeks but now it’s really time to look forward as a football club<br /><br />I am really excited about Unai’s appointment. I feel he’s a great fit for our football club. His value set, the way he conducts himself is really <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> class. Underneath that, you’ve got all of the technical side that he brings to the table and then on top of it all, which our fans will connect with, is this passion for the game and this energy. Once he brings that into the Emirates and into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, our fans are going to feel electrified by it<br /><br />We don’t know what the journey will hold exactly, and there will certainly be ups and downs, but I think our fans will appreciate the commitment and the passion that we’re bringing to this effort and I think they’ll be behind us on this journey</p>

Arsenal is entering a new chapter and I have done everything I can to ensure that it is strongly placed to take on that challenge. This includes world-class facilities and outstanding leaders in every sector who carry the values of the club, including, of course, Unai Emery, Raul Sanllehi and Vinai Venkatesham, in whom I have enormous faith. Although it is very hard to do - the hardest decision of my life - I believe that, after 10 years, it is the right time for me to step aside to allow new leadership, energy and ideas to take the club forward into this exciting new era. While this is the most difficult and challenging course for me, I am excited to see what the future holds for this great club</p>
