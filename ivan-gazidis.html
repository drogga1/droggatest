Mr <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Kroenke</a>, our controlling owner, has always fully supported Arsène and the Club in making significant investments to strengthen our squad and to bring in talented players who fit our style and ambitions. Like all of us, Mr <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Kroenke</a> wants to see <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> winning titles and trophies and he has absolute faith and belief in our manager to achieve that.

  <p><b>[Ivan Gazidis told the Frenchman’s time in North London may extend beyond the term of his new deal]</b> That is an assessment we continue to make as we move into the future, and who knows what the future holds. This is a two-year deal, so we are looking at at least the next two years. Again, at some point of course, we will have to transition to the era beyond <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and that is not a sentimental connection that we have, that is a connection that is driven by what is best for the football club … Arsene would not make this commitment, if he did not believe he could push this club forward</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis says the research <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> had done on the club’s young talent was one of the reasons for his appointment as the club’s new head coach]</b> What was really impressive was when you scratched the surface to go deeper and deeper and deeper<br /><br />If we were speaking about one of our young players, if we targeted <a href="ainsley-maitland-niles.html">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a> for example, Unai knows Ainsley. He’s watched him, he’s familiar with his patterns of play, his capabilities, he’s very excited about his potential and was able to talk about how excited he was to work with Ainsley, to develop him as a player<br /><br />Very specifically, when you asked the follow-up question and the follow-up question and the follow-up question, you’d get more and more depth about how exactly he would do that, exactly how him and his team would work with an individual player to develop them into the best player they can possibly be and also within the team dynamic<br /><br />There are a lot of platitudes in the game of football, a lot, and people can speak at a surface level very easily to sound confident and impressive. What’s impressive to me is when you scratch through that and you get deeply involved in what exactly they mean<br /><br /><b>[Gazidis, however, is under no illusions about the size of the task facing Emery, who won a domestic treble before leaving PSG]</b> The hard work starts right now. We are right into the transfer window of course, but we’re also into many other things such as how we’re going to integrate his team, how we think about pre-season planning, how the teams are going to work together<br /><br />There’s a lot of work to be done now to integrate this new team into our existing team. I know that we can do that successfully but it’s going to take hard work through the summer. There’s been obviously a lot of question marks as we’ve gone through this period of transition over recent weeks but now it’s really time to look forward as a football club<br /><br />I am really excited about Unai’s appointment. I feel he’s a great fit for our football club. His value set, the way he conducts himself is really <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> class. Underneath that, you’ve got all of the technical side that he brings to the table and then on top of it all, which our fans will connect with, is this passion for the game and this energy. Once he brings that into the Emirates and into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, our fans are going to feel electrified by it<br /><br />We don’t know what the journey will hold exactly, and there will certainly be ups and downs, but I think our fans will appreciate the commitment and the passion that we’re bringing to this effort and I think they’ll be behind us on this journey</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> are set to launch an anti-racism task force to tackle discrimination in Italian football]</b> Italian football needs to wake up and take a strong stance against racist behaviour. <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> will take a leadership position on this issue, promoting basic human values that are relevant to us all. Football provides a powerful example of the strength of unity and teamwork. Diversity, inclusion and tolerance enhance the strength of the team, the club and of society as a whole. We believe that we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to address this issue. This first significant step aims to visibly demonstrate that we will be proactive in our efforts to tackle racism in football. These values transcend football rivalries and we are delighted to have the support of Inter for this initiative</p>
