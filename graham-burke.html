  <p>[how Graham Burke went from Europe’s top scorer to English exile] I just made my debut for the Under-21s three weeks ago against Portugal, and I think that came from doing well for Villa. Noel King came over to watch us and you always want to impress the national manager, but club football comes first. I know if I do well at Villa, then hopefully international football will lead from that. Winning the NextGen was the biggest achievement of my career, and especially scoring the two goals in the final. I think that if I keep working hard, then opportunities will come<br /><br />For someone to move away at 16, it’s very difficult. The English guys finish training and go home to environments they’re comfortable with. I was a young guy coming over from Ireland, didn’t know anyone, didn’t know the area I was living in<br /><br />Every year I was there, we were fighting relegation. It’s a risk to be playing young guys and bringing young guys into the team. Most of the time you’d be on the bench, training with them, but as far as getting that chance you want, it’s not there with the team struggling. For them, they can’t say ‘we’ll give this young boy a go’. If they were doing well, they might be able to give chances to the younger players<br /><br />I went on loan to Shrewsbury and that didn’t work out for me, so I came back to Villa. I then went to Notts County on loan for about 13 games, and ended up playing 10 of them. It worked out for me. Then I ended up signing for them. You have to go out and play. You can’t just play in underage football, so I went out to experience playing football with men, and test yourself against men. After six months at Notts County, I was doing well. But then the manager got sacked, and a new manager comes in. I wasn’t even figuring for the next six months. I had to make another decision. I wasn’t enjoying it. So, at least I know if I go back to Ireland, and around family and be happy. If I’m happier, I’ll perform better<br /><br />Why can’t I be the top goalscorer? What’s stopping me being the top goalscorer in Europe? I left Villa when I was 21. I still have time. I can get back to where I want to be if I do well. That’s still the aim. You want to do as best you can and get to where you want to be. Even with Shamrock Rovers, there’s so much ability that can make it. I know what it’s like, I’ve been in England, I see players that should be there. The margin is very slim. In football, you need a bit of luck. Luck is very important in football, and maybe I didn’t have that</p>
