  <p><b>[Players who play regularly for national teams ranked in the top 50 of FIFA’s rankings qualify for work permits to play in England automatically. Jamaica is ranked 61st]</b> It’s hard to know that you want to play in that top division, that top league, and you can’t get to go because of stipulations like that. It’s their rules and you have to live by it. We talk about it on a regular basis, but these things take time. More than one time opportunities like that have presented themselves for me, but we already know that if they’re not talking about a $10 million or $11 million transfer it’s a no-no for Jamaican players in England.</p>

  <p><b>[Kemar Lawrence protests about his wage]</b> It always feels like we don’t want to pay somebody to keep them or get the right persons. Always trying to save some money or do something the cheaper way instead of investing in somebody and watching it turn over, you get me?<br /><br />I told them already: This is my club. I really want to stay. But I know I should be paid. All I’m asking is for them to invest in me then watch me do the work. I’ve been doing the work. Just continue to invest in me, show me you appreciate me and let me do the work</p>
