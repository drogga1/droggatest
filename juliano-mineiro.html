  <p><b>[Juliano Mineiro is already looking forward to the next game and is determined to play better]</b> I am very happy that we scored, but what’s important is that we worked hard as a team. Now our focus is on the next game and we will improve from game to game. I must improve in every game. I’ve been here for a month and I must improve every time I play and I hope the coaches like that</p>

  <p><b>[No pressure for Selangor’s Juliano Mineiro despite possibility of losing place to Andik Vermansyah]</b> No <b>[not worried]</b>. I am a professional, I do my best all the time. I have a contract and I am happy here, I am happy during training and during matches. I can play, I am 100 per cent the same <b>[unaffected]</b>.<br /><br />I try and I can <b>[score goals]</b>, but I want to help my team by controlling the game, with my passing, to help the striker score. But sometimes when I get chances, I try to put them away<br /><br />All the games are very hard for me. We’ll try to win there, and we can do it</p>

  <p><b>[According to their Brazilian-born East Timorese player Juliano Mineiro, his contract with the Red Giants will only be decided during the mid-season break]</b> I feel good, I’m happy here. I focus on tomorrow <b>[match against Pahang]</b>, after tomorrow I talk to the club about my future. But now I focus on tomorrow, and then there’s a long break and I can discuss about my future.<br /><br />My contract finishes next month, but there’s enough time <b>[to discuss about it]</b>, so I focus on winning next game <b>[against Pahang]</b></p>
