<blockquote>
  <p>[Can Wilmer Cabrera help the Houston Dynamo emulate success of rival FC Dallas?] It kind of feels like an expansion team. They have a lot of turnover from last year, a lot of new guys brought in, obviously hired a new coaching staff, brought in some players who are not familiar with MLS and a couple who are. We all have to be on the same page quickly. We have seven out of our first 10 games at home. We have to take advantage of that, and to do that we have to be on the same page. It’s a good opportunity for us to get off on the right foot, so we’ve got to make sure we take it.<br /><br />He wants 100 percent intensity when we’re doing things. Obviously, I think every coach wants your 100 percent every single time you step on the field, whether it’s training or a game, but he keeps applying that to get it through guys’ heads. The Dynamo had a tough year last year and we’re all trying still to learn one another and to get to know one another and learn each other’s tendencies when we’re out here on the field, no matter what it is. If we’re stretching or playing small side, we have to be focused and continue to get better every day</p>
