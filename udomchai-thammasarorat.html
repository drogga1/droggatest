<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Sunday, Udomchai defended his actions. He said his side was ready to talk, but the Kuala Lumpur trip was meant for a meeting with Abdul Rahim only and not with any specific group]</b> Regarding MARA Patani, both sides were scheduled to meet at a technical level. Our side was led by Maj. Gen. Kriangkrai Srisak, the secretary-general of the peace delegation. But the facilitator’s team informed us that MARA Patani wanted to meet us as a full delegation and everyone was there, whereas the full team was not scheduled to meet<br /><br /><b>[Udomchai said he was willing to hold a smaller meeting]</b> To keep the relationship, MARA Patani peace talk chief <a href="sukree-hari.html">Sukree Haree</a> was allowed to meet one-on-one with me first, but MARA Patani did not accept that and resorted to issuing a statement. Formal talks must get through the technical level, to fix topics so that we don’t waste time and we may be able to agree on something that we can start right away</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At present, we still have peace talks in accordance with national strategy. The Thai government is always open for all dissident groups to talk, without forcing anyone to. Currently, talks still go on. There is some progress with some groups. Once the talks are done it will become official</p>

  <p><b>[A man identified as Pak Fakir also said BRN (Barisan Revolusi Nasional) officials had met a Thai delegation ‘at a location in Southeast Asia’ on Aug. 16, but Thailand’s peace talk chief, Gen. Udomchai Thammasarorat, flatly denied this]</b> It is not true. We did not have such talk at all … In regard to Pak Fakir, the man who claims to be the a senior leader of BRN, I don’t know who he is and where he lives</p>
