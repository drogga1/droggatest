  <p><b>[Kolo Toure on Yaya Toure]</b> I have had a similar experience to Yaya <b>[Toure]</b>. Coaches go to clubs, take players with them and want to pick them a tall costs - regardless of whether they are any good or not. Yaya was much better than <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but he was behind him in the pecking order and he found that hard to accept. I advised him to come to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> while I was still there. He listened to his big brother’s advice and now he is the big boss on the field for them. I was better than certain players at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but I was left on the bench. Before I left I told the people in charge that they would regret letting me go. People said I was finished and that I could never get back to my former level. But now I’m sure that City must now be kicking themselves when they see how I’m performing</p>

  <p><b>[Kolo Toure’s grand plan to become pioneer for African coaches]</b> When I came to the UK, we had no-one from the Ivory Coast in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I had no-one to aspire to, no-one I could look to for inspiration. We had players coming from different countries - like from Cameroon, or Nigeria with <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a> - I’m used to the situation where you have to come from a long way because you have no idols, no role-models to look up to.<br /><br />The first thing is to have the knowledge. I am doing my badge here because I know I am getting the best advice, the best management skills, the best way to coach players, communicate with players, impact the players. Some of my friends who have been playing maybe haven’t thought of that. But I want to do it because I think Africa needs that. Africa needs people who can inspire them. It’s difficult. You are putting yourself out there and it’s going to be hard. But there always has to be one person to start - and then the rest will follow<br /><br />I felt I had to do everything properly. Because when you are the first player to come from your country, people judge every other Ivory Coast player by how you do. If you do things right, they will always think, Kolo Toure comes from the Ivory Coast and he’s doing well. That means there are other good players in the Ivory Coast. They will go and find new talent there. <br /><br />I was really proud of that because <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, Yaya, Zokora, Gervinho, Salomon Kalou, many players from the Ivory Coast came here to express their talent. The one thing I really like about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> <b>[is]</b> it doesn’t matter where you come from. People judge you on what you do. The song we have, me and my brother Yaya - people were singing our names here more than in <b>[our]</b> own country. Of course people in Africa love us, but the expression of love here is unbelievable. We were coming from another country but people will embrace you. Of course, up and down, there is bad and there is good. But the good is much bigger<br /><br />The worst part was doing something and not knowing I had done anything wrong. All I did was take something to make me do more pee-pee. I am very careful of my weight, even now, and weigh myself pretty much every day because I don’t want to put any weight on. I have done that since the start of my career. My weight had been up and down a little bit. When you put on two, three, four kilos, you are a different player<br /><br /><b>[He did not expect to fail the test]</b> I was shocked. Honestly, I was shocked. The thing that hurt a lot more is that my 15-year-old daughter just came to me and said to me, ‘Dad, you took drugs?’ I think one of the boys at school made a comment to her. ‘We’ll have to test you,’ he said, ‘because your dad took drugs.’<br /><br />I said to her, ‘No, no, darling - it’s not ‘drugs’. In the football world, when people say ‘drugs’, it can just mean something that is banned and you cannot have. But it is not cocaine or anything like that.’<br /><br />Having to explain hurt a little bit. That is the bad side of it - explaining to her at the time. I told her not to worry about it, but I felt like I had hurt her a little bit<br /><br /><b>[His daughter is 15 now, understanding more every day, and Toure knows she must be thin-skinned if and when he takes the leap to become a head coach]</b> They’re growing up and they know a little bit. I’m used to that, but they will get used to it anyway<br /><br /><b>[Once his playing career finished, he thought about ‘what I could bring to the world’]</b> The only thing I know, and the only way I can help people and young people from my continent, is football. One of the most important things - touching my heart - is that I am from Africa. I have a dream that one day an African team may win the World Cup. This is what I am working for. I want someone from my continent to win it. It is going to be difficult but it’s in my head. It’s my target</p>

  <p><b>[Toure and Gallas’ feud ran so deep that the Ivory Coast international felt he had to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> so avoid troubling the Gunners further]</b> When you play with somebody and you don’t even talk to each other on the pitch it’s really difficult. Me and <a href="william-gallas.html">Gallas</a> … we didn’t talk to each other at all. One of us had to go and it was me. It was coming down to me really because I didn’t want to put the team in a difficult position, so I was the one who said I wanted to go</p>
