  <p><b>[On Neymar]</b> He always falls very light, you can barely touch him. Neymar is the greatest actor in football. Neymar is better than me, so to compete you try to be close and sometimes you need to do tricks and get into his head to guess what he will do.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar may be a €222 million footballer, but the Paris Saint-Germain forward will never receive the plaudits of Lionel Messi unless he cuts out the theatrics]</b> It was the same as usual from Neymar. He is an unbelievable footballer but we have seen the other stuff before and we will see it again. I have said before that it’s part of his game. He tries to over-react a bit to make the defender step off. We will see it again and again. If he wants to be liked as much as Messi, maybe he needs to stop that.<br /><br /><b>[Lustig added after a 5-0 defeat for Celtic which saw 18-year-old defender Anthony Ralston involved in a long-running battle with Neymar]</b> He’s up there with the best already - he’s so sharp and is an amazing footballer. Neymar is probably the toughest opponent in the world right now but Anthony did well<br /><br />PSG are probably up there with the very best teams I have faced. They have world-class players in every position. They are probably better than Barcelona last year with no weak links. Every single player is unbelievable on the ball. If you spend a lot of money, it is no shock you will have a team like that</p>
