  <p><b>[Tom Cleverley says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are having to deal with inflated asking prices in the January transfer window]</b> When <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are involved and in the situation they are in, clubs tend to put their asking price up and that looks like the case this time around. They are struggling to find that midfielder that can open teams up and they desperately need somebody that can do that<br /><br />The leaving part wasn’t the hard part, <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> sat me down and said it how it is: ‘I’m signing <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a> so the opportunities are going to be limited’. The hard part for me was the year under <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a>, the way the fans turned on you. I had been there since 11 years old and for the fans to go as sour as it did was disappointing. I was a player who would try 100 per cent every game, it wasn’t for a lack of trying, I just wasn’t good enough that year. That was the thing that disappointed me, but the actual leaving I didn’t have a problem with. It was a difficult time for me and my family. Living in Manchester, playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it’s a bit of a goldfish bowl. It comes with the territory and I’ve got over it now</p>
