  <p><b>[Mohamed Sissoko says <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s modern-day equivalent of <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and Jamie Carragher]</b> They are super players. Jason Henderson was not so strong at the beginning of his career, it was clear that he was good but today he is a top player and it is thanks to Klopp: the German has improved him a lot. Milner is the ideal midfielder, the tough and physically strong Englishman who helps young people a lot. He is for the boys what <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> were for me when I arrived: masters of life<br /><br />I think <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> did well to say that in the second leg it will be more difficult for the Spaniards. I played a semi-final between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at Anfield: the opponents’ legs were shaking. It is a unique stadium, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> a unique club. <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> perhaps does not know what it will find in England, they cannot even imagine it. The strength of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> is not comparable, the fans feel inside the locker room as if they were outside the door</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Sissoko says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> tipped to ‘abandon’ <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> return]</b> I think he will return to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He will come back due to situations that have arisen. Everything suggests that he will abandon Manchester and England and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> is a club that knows him and where he is loved and respected unconditionally<br /><br />I think <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are very well equipped. <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> told the truth: it’s not a single period that defines a club’s strength. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> has unique players. I think the best final can be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. Two unique clubs in mentality, player strength and football history. I was lucky enough to play in both clubs and I was lucky. They both have atomic attacks. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is younger, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> has more experience. We speak of very high levels in both Turin and Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Sissoko thinks <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> will go to Real Madrid]</b> No, I think <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is likelier to, because he has the characteristics that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> wants - he really rates him. I think <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> will go to Real Madrid<br /><br /><b>[on Salah’s future at Anfield]</b> I don’t know if Salah will stay at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. If he left, it could also be a good thing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - they’re a clever club and they’d know how to replace him. There are some fantastic youngsters who have what it takes to play for the Reds and put in top performances<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are something special. The fans, the club … I played with really terrific players there. Like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> also helped me to grow as a player and as a person. It’s a shame that they’ve been knocked out of the Champions League, but it has to be said that the main aim was to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The fans have been waiting to win the title for a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Sissoko says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> should be planning a raid on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for Jean-Clair Todibo. Sissoko feels any discussions with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> should also include Todibo]</b> We are talking about great footballers like <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a> who could leave the club, but I think it is a bit early to talk about it also because nobody can know what the post-Covid-19 situation will be. Todibo? I read that he is also talked about, he is a good player who is doing well at Schalke 04 and could adapt well to Juventus<br /><br /><b>[The ex-Mali international added when quizzed on who <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> should be targeting]</b> I really like <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Victor Osimhen</a> of Lille, for me that boy is very strong. He is a striker that we will continue to talk about in the next few years. While in midfield, I could recommend his team-mate Boubakary Soumare and Idrissa Doumbia, who is doing very well at Sporting Club de Portuga</p>
