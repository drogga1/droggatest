<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Royston Drenthe: From <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to rap and the Dutch third division]</b> At the time, I heard that 16 clubs were interested in me. I spoke with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> president <a href="joan-laporta.html">Joan Laporta</a> and <a href="predrag-mijatovic.html">Predrag Mijatovic</a>, director of football at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It felt like I met almost every high-ranking official at every club. Most of them offered me a five-year contract with more or less the same conditions. As soon as I heard <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> were interested, my mind was made up. As a boy, I was fascinated by everything around the club. The glamour around Real, like the kind you see in the movie Goal!, was something I really wanted to be part of<br /><br /><b>[Despite finding himself surrounded by some of the biggest names in football, the young Dutchman quickly settled and became fast friends with his team-mates]</b> Everyone gave me a warm welcome. <a href="guti.html">Guti</a> was cool with me straight away, and he was the man in Madrid – a legend. I developed a good bond with Robinho soon after I arrived. Sometimes I would go to his house, where he’d converted his basement into a mini-nightclub<br /><br /><b>[Unfortunately for Drenthe, the arrival of Marcelo in 2009 saw his playing opportunities limited and he was loaned out to Hercules in 2010. While showing some signs of promise in England, the winger spectacularly fell out with Toffees manager <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> after turning up late to a team meeting before an FA Cup semi-final]</b> I was waiting outside the room whereas I probably should have just walked in quietly and taken a seat. When I went in afterwards, <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> told me to f<em>ck off. I should have accepted it, but I said, ‘What do you mean, f</em>ck off, bro? You f*ck off’. And then I left for Holland and didn’t come back<br /><br /><b>[Known as Roya2Faces, the then 29-year-old released a number of singles over the following year as he found happiness away from football]</b> I’ve always liked music. When I’m happy I listen to music and when I’m sad I listen to music as well. It always gives me a good feeling. I was making music but it’s difficult to say that I was focused on one thing. I was busy with lots of different things<br /><br /><b>[Though Kozakken’s small stadium is a long way from the heights of the Santiago Bernabeu, Drenthe is perfectly happy with how his career has turned out]</b> No regrets at all. Everything happens for a reason. I don’t regret anything because I’m happy with where I am and I’m happy with where I’ve been. I’m living my life at the moment. I’m just Royston, you know? I go with the flow</p>
