  <p><b>[Rivelino on Brazilian football]</b> Brazilian football is, in terms of quality, terrible right now. We only have only player who can make a difference: <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. Hulk? For the love of God. Brazil has always had two or three top strikers, but now we have no-one. It’s absurd. The best striker was have is a fatty, it’s Walter. And I want a chubby Walter <b>[to play]</b> instead of the very skinny one (Jo)</p>

  <p><b>[Rivellino - one of the stars of the Brazil team that triumphed in the 1970 World Cup - has outlined the importance of Brazil now winning back the hearts of their adoring public by winning the Copa America]</b> I think it is not a matter of winning, but showing a good football. A football to give more confidence for the Brazilian people in order to believe more in the Selecao. People are not confident any more after that shame, for me it was a shame, to lose 7-1 to Germany, something I’ve never seen in football. But <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a> is showing that he is the right man. You cannot go against numbers. Brazil are a side that are always looking for scoring. But, yes, he is looking at our defensive philosophy too, because before we’ve thought ‘well, if we don’t concede, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can decide the game up front’. It’s <b>[a case of]</b> asking other players to make better plays, even though only <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is capable of doing it. It is his way of trying to find what is best for Selecao now</p>

  <p><b>[Rivellino pay homage to ‘fantastic’ Ronaldo]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was fantastic, one of the greats of world football. He was a decisive player, he always went forward, he sought and craved goals. He was a player loved by the whole world and who played in giant clubs. He is how old now, 40? He’s an old man but I want to see him make my age. Cheers! I am a big fan of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, he was a great and a brilliant ambassador for Brazilian football</p>
