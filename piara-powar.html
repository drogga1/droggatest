<blockquote>
  <p><b>[FARE says Bulgaria should have been expelled from Euro 2020 qualifying]</b> We welcome the speed of this decision, but we are disappointed that Bulgaria will not be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying competition given their previous record, and obvious inability to deal with the problems they face. We think that the evidence and circumstances of this match would have justified European football being given a stronger signal on the need to tackle racism. Obtaining justice for racist acts is not easy in any setting, it is clear that football is no exception. We will be in touch with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to explore options and maintain that Bulgaria and others in the same situation fundamentally reappraise how they deal with racism</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Piara Powar, the executive director of anti-discrimination body Fare recently described the Italian football authoritiesâ€™ disciplinary systems as not fit for purpose]</b> Whether it is the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> <b>[Italian Football Federation]</b> or <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, they have failed to protect countless players from racism over the past year and have no meaningful response to the endemic racism in stadiums. There are no visible campaigns, no progressive fan leaders, as well as apathy and prejudice among the media. No-one is taking the issue seriously - no-one apart from the players, the victims themselves, and a few allies who have been courageous enough to stand up</p>
