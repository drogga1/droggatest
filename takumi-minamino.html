  <p><b>[Minamino welcomes <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> &amp; Mane competition after sealing £7.25m <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move]</b> Not only them, there are many world-class players here and of course it’s not an easy challenge. It’s not easy to overtake those players to get a position but having the mentality of challenging those players is important to keep the team’s high level. That sort of mentality is important for the team and I certainly will play with that mentality<br /><br />I’m looking forward to working with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, I think one of my strengths will be to be able to communicate with him in German - because I speak a bit of German - and I’m really looking forward to it. I think he is one of the best managers in the world and I always want to improve myself, so it would be great if I could make a contribution to the growth of the team and myself<br /><br />I’m an offensive player so I always want to assist and score goals. I would like to maintain that quality and the number of situations that directly lead to more goals and assists. I think that is my strength, so I would like to show that strength of mine in this team</p>

It was probably one of the most intense matches I’ve played, but I knew <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be like that so I wasn’t surprised<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether that will aid his transition]</b> The way we press aggressively, the way we press back, the way we use the space between lines are similar.

  <p><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> advices Takumi Minamino to play in his way and have fun!]</b> Only a few days have passed since my arrival, but I already have the impression of playing here for several months. That’s all the love I got from the manager, the staff and my team-mates <b>[…]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> offers you a phenomenal environment to focus on football. I remember <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> came to me after the first workout and said, ‘Don’t worry about what’s around you, play the same way you did Salzburg, play the Minamino way. And have fun!’.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on why he agreed to link up with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I received an offer from the best club currently on the planet, which means a lot to me. I felt it was a great opportunity, a great opportunity that I really wanted to seize. It all started with my entourage, I knew that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was interested in me. I was surprised, but after facing them twice in the Champions League and having had the opportunity to speak to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, I became more and more impatient to take up the challenge. Having scored a goal at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, that gave me some confidence. I told myself that we had to come and savour this atmosphere over time!</p>

  <p><b>[Minamino has nothing to lose at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and doesn’t feel pressure]</b> I feel the manager’s trust in me, so I really want to repay him. Personally, I’m not satisfied with my own performance <b>[at Wolves]</b>, so I want to meet the expectations of the people who support me. I was mentally ready to go and all I was thinking was how to fit into the team smoothly and get into the game. I don’t feel any pressure. I’m not sure how much expectation has been put on me, but I have nothing to lose<br /><br /><b>[He added on what he can offer to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> cause]</b> I can play on either side, but it was more about how to link up with the full-backs. If we can build a better understanding of each other, I’m sure it will get even better. They scored an equaliser after I came on, so I was desperate to contribute to the winning goal in any way I can. After we scored the second goal, I made sure to keep it simple and defend solidly</p>

  <p><b>[Takumi Minamino says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> told him that he wants him to play the way he wants when he joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in January]</b> I cannot forget his words - two or three days after joining the club, he said I could play in any way I wanted to play. So I was really happy as a player that he said that. In the locker room, he is very good at motivating players, so I want to respond to his motivation even in the practice sessions and in the actual games<br /><br /><b>[And Minamino is eager to aid their quest for the league crown, saying]</b> I would like to contribute to the team winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> first, but the nearest target is just to play in the games, and make a goal, or even assist one.<br /><br />Of course I am really happy to be in this club, but it is not certain we are going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title yet. So to make it 100 per cent sure, I would like to contribute and to offer my power and strength to the team<br /><br />I just found a new house to live in and am getting settled in, so I am quite relaxed at the moment living in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Every player is very welcoming, but especially <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> as they live near me. And the players who can speak German are very helpful too. The schedule is really tight, so I do not have enough time to study English. But when we move places, I try to read books and remember the words. The best words to describe my feeling <b>[at signing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> were delight and joyful<br /><br /><b>[The former Cerezo Osaka star says he was wanted by several teams before he opted to make his childhood dream a reality by joining the Reds]</b> I cannot tell you which other teams approached me, but some <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and German clubs. The reason why I chose to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was that playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was one of my dreams since my childhood, so I had no reason to say no to them. I like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was one of my favourite clubs growing up.

  <p><b>[Takumi Minamino admits he is still learning how <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> operate]</b> In the last three months there have been areas which I’m quite happy about.

But day by day, I’m feeling that I understand his <b>[Klopp’s]</b> philosophies and I’m getting better. I have to show results. I think this is very important in order to win trust from the team-mates and trust from the supporters. I think this is a very important thing that I have to achieve. I have been in this club for three months and I haven’t played many games and my playing time is not that much - but this is not a good excuse. I think I’m still <b>[learning]</b> to fully understand the team, but I still hate to wait. In order to make an instant impact and make a contribution to the team, I’m doing my best every day. I only have limited chances but when the manager needs me, I have to show the results of the manager’s expectations<br /><br />It’s really important to focus 100 per cent on the remaining Champions League and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles. Of course, we failed to win some titles and we’re obviously very disappointed but we have to use that feeling. We only can get over that disappointment of this loss by winning the next matches. Luckily we’ve got a very tight schedule and the next match is coming soon at the weekend. We stop thinking about this loss by just concentrating on winning this next match and training harder. We are never negative; we all think about winning the next match. The atmosphere in the dressing room is really positive - we keep this positivity in training every day</p>
