  <p><b>[Quizzed on his future ambition and association with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>]</b> I grew up playing against <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> from the age of 13 onwards and we were both at Torcy at different times. We were both captains of our clubs and I still have pennants in my old house that we exchanged. So to be a part of that team who won the World Cup with Paul was brilliant for me.<br /><br />I have never hidden my desire that one day I will be playing in the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a>. I am friends with <a href="issa-diop.html">Issa Diop</a> at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and he has told me why it’s the best league in the world and very exciting to play in. But maybe that is for the future. At Toulouse, I would only award ourselves maybe five out of 20 as a mark for the season. We ended up fighting against relegation and with a squad with as much talent as we had, we should have done better. I try to improve my concentration levels and my leadership skills every season because it’s very important to my job. I would also like to be stronger aerially. It’s a little presumptuous, but I want to become impassable. That’s my ultimate objective in my head. For me, I don’t know what my future brings. I will leave that to the club and my agents</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> have completed the signing of defender Christopher Jullien from Toulouse on a four-year deal]</b> I’m really happy to be here. I’ve had a warm welcome, so everything is perfect! I can’t wait to start here. I already know the stadium is amazing and the fans are crazy and really get behind the team. I’m really looking forward to playing in front of these fans. It’s an experience I’m excited for and, like I say, I just can’t wait to get started. I’m so happy to be finally be here. It’s achievements like this team have made that you dream of when you start out in football. I will try to bring everything for the team. This is a team who have won a lot. Last year they achieved a big thing and I’m going to try and give everything I can. I’m going to join the team on Sunday and I’m going to try and be ready for these big games coming up so I can help the team bring Champions League football back to this stadium.</p>

  <p><b>[Christopher Jullien says <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a> continues to spark talk of interest from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> Odsonne is a good player and one day he will have a lot of clubs interested in him. But he’s in a really good place right now with <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. He’s done some unbelievable stuff and I really hope that he’ll stay here. I enjoy playing with him and I want him to stay for as long as he can. That would be incredible for everyone at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. He’s in a really good place. It’s so difficult just now with this situation. People speak about transfers but who knows when football will be back? After that, all the other stuff can happen. But don’t worry, I’m sure Odsonne is happy where he is. I’m sure he will stay. He is silent, he hides what he is feeling and he’s someone who controls his emotions. But he’s a really good guy, trust me. He is quite happy at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Jullien added, with <a href="neil-lennon.html">Neil Lennon</a>’s side closing in on a ninth successive title triumph]</b> We all want to finish the league, for sure. We were on a great run, playing very good football. The league stopped just before our game against Rangers and we felt so good. We couldn’t wait to play that game. But if the decision is to finish it now and crown us champions - I think we deserve it. I want to finish the games. But we’re 13 points clear and we’ve shown our strength all season. If we have to play the games, we’re happy to do it. But if it cannot be done, in my mind, we deserve to be champions. Football is so important in our lives but it’s not the most important thing</p>
