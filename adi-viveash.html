  <p><b>[Mason Mount: How midfielder ended <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s long wait for homegrown star]</b> You could see the first-team players trusted him because he’s so good on the ball. The first thing you notice is that they’re not afraid to give it him all the time.<br /><br />I know Antonio was very impressed with him after that game. That was probably a moment the recognition got gained. They started to ask for him if they needed a midfield player. It made an impression on them<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> The best is yet to come, and he’ll want to be the best. I’d certainly expect to see a better <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> than you’re seeing at the moment, which is brilliant for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans and England</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth coach Viveash says I am over the moon they have Lampard]</b> The way things ended for me at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was certainly a shock. It shows that you can do as good of a job as you think you can and then someone taps you on the shoulder and say that’s enough. I think that hardens you, changes you and I think nothing can be as bad as that felt. I will always have a bit of regret at the way it ended on my part. There’s also regret on other people’s parts but I look at myself about certain things. In the times between jobs, you soul search yourself. If you want to improve, that’s what you have to do. I have done a lot of that and Coventry are reaping the rewards of that and getting a better skill set from me than I had before. I will always be respectful of the role the academy had on me and the people at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in that building. I worked with some exceptional players and I was very fortunate. I have a good relationship still with a lot of them. It was a good time in my life. Reading was the biggest club I had played at as a player and Swindon made <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> felt like another level even in the academy. You do feel like a pawn in a massive industry and there was a big weight in the younger coaches behind me with some of them progressing to the first team. They wanted to make that change. In hindsight, you think you did a good job, worked tremendously hard and you gave your life to the role which is what it needs. If a youth player plays for the first team, then only one person picks them and that’s the manager. My argument has always been with the coaches that there have been a lot of players good enough for many years. I am over the moon that they have <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> as manager after he has trusted people. I look back fondly when I think of the players, who are not just in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s first team, who are playing at the top level from my time. Maybe they are playing at a level below what’s right for them but we take great pride in the work we did with them. It was a fascinating time and I learned a lot about myself. There’s a lot of politics to deal with. It is a big club; you learn how to manage yourself, your strengths and weaknesses. I take it into my next role. Whatever happens in the future, I still feel quite lucky.<br /><br />I have respect for what <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is doing and trusting these players is amazing and it has left the academy buzzing with more work to do. Still, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has six of the world’s best players at that time, so there’s that point too. Let’s not forget that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s greats are still the greats now. They were in their prime back then and winning everything including the Champions League in 2012. Josh McEachran, Jeffrey Bruma from Dermot Drummy’s team, God rest his soul, I expected some of them would make it, but they didn’t. It goes back through the decade of unrivalled and incredible success in the academy. Winning is incredible for a player’s development. Especially at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because if you get in the team, you have to win. So, that’s an important part but I do have a little bit on the other side thinking we had <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> himself. These guys were world class and it left it difficult for the kids to get in past them. Still, it needed to be made achievable and I think it was frustrating because it didn’t feel achievable. It should feel achievable. I think now that Frank hasn’t given any pardons to anyone. He has made it achievable if he sees the right things. I can’t speak for Frank, I coached him a few times and spoke to him a few times, but I just see he was a world class footballer. He was tremendously driven, worked so hard on his game, on his own or in a group setting and I think he enjoys working hard. I think he likes the boys from the academy because they work hard and feel the club. I am sure if they didn’t take their chance then he wouldn’t give them another one. Now, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s first team with all due respect doesn’t have the level of the player that it had from that period. You have to be honest about that<br /><br />I got a call from <a href="mark-robins.html">Mark Robins</a> because sadly his number two Steve Taylor had been taken seriously ill. I had just come back from a holiday in Portugal and I didn’t want to go in at that time to work. I had an offer from Coventry, then in League Two, after being with some of the best young players in Europe. I also wasn’t sure how I could help him. Then, I looked at the squad and saw they had players who are usually playing at a higher level. I said I would come in for a few days and have a look. I had played with Mark at Walsall for a year but it is not like we are close friends. It was a frank and honest conversation about how I could help him. I needed a lot of things to change because the way I trained on the grass was a long way away from how they worked. That’s with respect to League Two players, but he was open to how that change might work. We are two-and-a-half years down the line of the process and the trust grows the more you work with each other. Now, he has a lot of trust in me to implement his ideas on the training ground which I enjoy. The goal is to get back to the Championship. If we are playing in Coventry again, we deserve to be there. It is a big club in terms of fans but not stature because it has sadly had so many problems behind the scenes for the last decade. I haven’t been through it all but I have seen behind the scenes some of the difficulties. There are very dedicated staff and it is their club and it would be nice for them for it to settle especially if we get back to Coventry getting crowds of 25,000 or 30,000 in the Championship. There is potential and the manager deserves tremendous credit for galvanising the public and players to become one and create an identity. They see players fighting for the shirt and they get it. I have really enjoyed this season because we play exceptional football and we are winning. That’s what you want. I found this difficult since moving from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Winning at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in an academy is important and development here is important. But, the winning in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is for tomorrow and here it is today. You develop in defeat but as a manager, you can’t have too many defeats. That’s difficult and I won’t get used to it<br /><br />I wasn’t quick enough to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I broke my leg when Swindon got in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in the October in the reserves and I sat on the bench in the early games. It is one of my biggest regrets that I didn’t play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I still have burning ambitions to achieve in the game. I would like to get back to the level I was working at but probably in a senior setting. I didn’t play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or get to coach in it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I didn’t get that final step into the first team there for whatever reason. Maybe in the future, there’s an opportunity for me to get in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> coaching at a different club. If I was able to achieve that, then I would be extremely happy with my life in football. I have been very fortunate that it has provided me with a wonderful life and living for many years and long may it continue</p>

  <p><b>[coach Adi Viveash - who won the FA Youth Cup with Colkett, Ssewankambo and Wright in 2012 - thinks that the 24-year-old’s time will come]</b> Colkett had the most ability that I have seen in a player and I still feel he will rise again. He was an 11-year-old in my Under-12s group and I loved working with him. The way his career has gone, with him going to Sweden, has been a surprise to me ,if I am honest. Maybe he has taken a slightly different curve than he or I would have hoped but he will have learned a lot about himself. He had incredible ability as a young player</p>
