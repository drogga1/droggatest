  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has been urged to consider a move to Crystal Palace]</b> 100 per cent. I’d take Jack Wilshere tomorrow. I think he’s terrific. If you could get him injury-free, what a signing that would be for Crystal Palace. Obviously he’s a London boy so hopefully he wants to stay in London and play and I think Palace would be the right club. And hopefully if Steve Parish can make it happen, it would be magnificent if Roy Hodgson wanted him. But I don’t know why you wouldn’t want Jack Wilshere. When he’s injury-free, I think he’s still got a lot to offer and I think he’s a very good midfielder.<br /><br />They’ll definitely try to spend, without shadow of a doubt. They won’t want to be in that situation that they were in this season, fighting relegation, even though in the end they could finish in the top 10, which would be a great achievement. But you don’t always want to keep fighting relegation. I think they’ve got the real man in charge now, Roy Hodgson. I think Steve Parish will back the manager again. And I don’t think there’s a lot needs to be done. But I think three or four new players coming in, because we don’t know if they’ll keep <b>[Ruben]</b> Loftus-Cheek, who’s been brilliant since he came back from injury. There’s a lot of changes that should be happening at Palace but the main one I think is you’ve got to try and keep Wilfried Zaha</p>

  <p><b>[Clinton Morrison says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> and <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> should be considering moves for <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> following his release by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I believe <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> is still good enough to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s got great technical ability. Before all of his injuries, for me personally, I think he was the best English striker in the county. I thought he was better than <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. He’s the most naturally-gifted finisher I’ve seen. He’s the most natural finisher in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team, but you just can’t get him in that team because of the work-rate of Mane, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. He’s had a lot of injuries, but I think he’d be a great addition for most <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams. Maybe not in the top three or four, maybe not for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but he could go to a team like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br />I would love my old club <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> to get him and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> could be a good shout - he and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> work well together. Rangers could work too, maybe <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> could get the best out of him, but I think he will want to stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I don’t think <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> is money orientated, he was earning a lot of money at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and that could have set him up for the rest of his career. He’ll want to go to a club where he’s playing week-in, week-out, and I still think he can do a great job in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />The big question with him will always be, how fit is he going to be? But mentally he’s in a good place at the moment a fit and hungry <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> is an asset for any team. As a striker, all you want to do is score goals, that’s all you live to do, and if you can get 30 games out of Sturridge for the whole season, then you’ve got one hell of a player. He’ll be fit, flying, he’ll have a point to prove and nobody has to pay a fee for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Clinton Morrison says <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> are demanding £80 million for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> target <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> because they cannot afford to lose him and <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> in the same window]</b> Every Palace fan will be happy if <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> stays. I think he’ll come back and be the same model professional he is and churn out performances. I think he’ll eventually get his move. He and the chairman have a close relationship so eventually Wilf will say to the chairman and say please let me go. He has come out and said that, but he signed a new deal just over a year ago and he’s still got four years to go.<br /><br />So the chairman is in a comfortable position not to make him go and he’s got to do what’s right for the football club. £80m <b>[for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>]</b> is a lot of money. I would say £60m is about right, but I don’t think he’ll let him go for that. He’s got another four years left on his contract so the chairman is in a good position. Obviously Wilfried wants to play at a bigger club and wants to play at a higher level, and I totally get that because he’s a fantastic footballer. But I believe Wilf will still be a Palace player come the end of the window<br /><br /><b>[Morrison believes that <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> has become a victim of <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>’s move, with Palace aware that they cannot take the risk of parting with two prized assets heading into another crucial <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign]</b> £80m is a lot of money, but I feel the chairman is only doing that because he doesn’t want to lose <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> and <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> in the same window. It could be a long hard season if we lose both of them and we don’t improve the squad. If Palace do lose him I am really worried about what it’s going to be like for Palace this coming season. They need to sign players. I know the chairman and the club have got a few bids in for certain players they want, but they need to get some over the line soon. They definitely need to bring in three or four players to improve the squad and they need strikers</p>

  <p><b>[Clinton Morrison explains just what makes ‘the cage’ <b>[of South London]</b> so special - and so valued to those who wanted to be the best]</b> The cage is the boss. There are some boys who would try to come into the cage who weren’t good enough, and they were told, nicely, ‘don’t come on here again mate, you’re not good enough’.<br /><br />The cage was the one where you had to come and bring your ‘A’ game; if your ‘A’ game wasn’t correct then you might as well leave it. I’ve seen certain men come to the cage and looked at their feet and go: ‘I don’t think you’re going to be alright here. You can’t be coming to the cage in Timberlands and stuff like that. We are playing football out here!’. In that cage you might as well leave</p>

  <p><b>[Clinton Morrison believes it may take more than just <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> and cash to prise <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> from <a href="crystal-palace.html">Selhurst Park</a> for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> The only way I can see <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> selling <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is if they get <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Michy Batshuayi</a>, <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> and money. I cannot see <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> leaving in January, I cannot see the Palace chairman letting him go, he’s still so important to the football club. Without a shadow he will be gone in the summer but, for now, I still see him staying in January because Palace aren’t safe yet. If they sold <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> it would be a big struggle to stay up</p>
