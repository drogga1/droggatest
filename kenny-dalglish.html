  <p><b>[FC Celtic legend Kenny Dalglish believes Kieran Tierney could end up staying at Parkhead, with a long-running transfer saga involving Arsenal and Napoli having reached stalemate]</b> Kieran Tierney’s transfer situation looks as though it could rumble on for a wee bit yet. The Celtic left-back has been linked with a move away, and there have been regular news stories about Arsenal and Napoli being interested in the 22-year-old. The other piece of the jigsaw is that the Parkhead hierarchy are holding out for a straight £25 million fee for their player. Of course, the identities of the clubs that may or may not be chasing him – and the amount of money it would take to land him – have never been officially confirmed as nobody has gone on the record to put everyone fully in the picture. But we know how these things work.<br /><br />Kieran hasn’t gone public on the situation. But it would fair to say that perhaps he feels the time is right to try something different, and there is a curiosity as to what might be out there for him. There is nothing wrong with that. He is perfectly entitled to explore any options that may come his way. Whatever happens, to date he has given four years of outstanding service to Celtic, and that should never be forgotten or tarnished. But he is also powerless in many ways as he can’t officially get involved until his club have agreed a fee and given him permission to talk about the length of contract and salary with a particular club. So, unless the valuation is met, there is a stalemate. The Hoops have every right to play hardball, and get what they believe to be a proper valuation. That could mean that the lad ends up staying at Celtic FC.</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has the support of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish when it comes to a quiet transfer window at Anfield. He told with Adrian, Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg the only arrivals]</b> Liverpool haven’t made any big-money signings, and everyone at the football club will be comfortable about that. They are the champions of Europe and have an exceptionally-strong squad. There is no point in bringing in new players unless they are an improvement on what you have. For every club, that’s not as easy as it sounds. You need to be patient and wait for the right moment and the right player. Some managers and chairmen might feel the need to buy for the sake of it, whether it’s to keep the fans happy or just add numbers. But the one thing about Jurgen Klopp is that he will absolutely not do anything that he does not want to do. That’s a fantastic quality to have. On the flipside, it’s just as important not to lose any of your top players and Liverpool haven’t sold anyone or loaned out anyone that weakens their squad</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Dalglish says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is going nowhere at Liverpool]</b> The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager stated that if he decides to call time on his career at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> a couple of years down the line, then <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> would be his tip to take over from him. It’s a hypothetical scenario, but one that I can see the sense in. I’m sure Jurgen is only echoing the thoughts of most of the club’s supporters. However, let’s be clear. Jurgen is going nowhere, and nobody with the club at heart wants to see him depart. He may have led the club to the Champions League last season, the biggest prize in European football. But there is much more he still wants to achieve – in particular <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first league title since 1990 – and this season has started very well. But the time will come when he decides it’s time to take a break, and nobody would be critical of him for doing so. At some stage, everybody needs a rest, a time to draw breath and take stock<br /><br />When that scenario unfolds, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, I’m quite certain, will come into the thoughts of everyone at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He knows the club inside out and is proving himself to be a very capable young manager at Rangers. Jurgen didn’t say what he did in order to angle a move away from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for himself, or to unsettle Steven at Ibrox. He was just speaking honestly. For me, the way Jurgen answered the question put to him once again reiterated just how much he ‘gets’ <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, from the way some people are regarded by everyone at the club to the mood and feelings of the supporters. Perhaps Steven might have been a wee bit embarrassed with Jurgen’s comments, but they would have been said with the best of intentions. Deep down inside, I’m sure Steven would have been very, very proud of Jurgen’s comments. But right now he has a job at Rangers to be getting on with, just as Jurgen will be fully focused on matters at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. Steven is doing very well at Ibrox. He has improved the team, and helped the club make huge strides forward off the park. The next step, of course, is to try to win silverware</p>

We had hoped that the families would get the outcome that they wanted and that they clearly deserved, but that hasn’t proven to be the case. The rest of us must now continue to offer whatever support they might need. From a personal point of view, I am immensely proud of everything that the families and their supporters have achieved over the last three decades. In the face of tragedy and with so much against them, they have persevered with the utmost integrity and in a way that shames all who have let them down. I know there cannot be any consolation in a situation like this, but I would hope that they can take some comfort from the fact that so many good people will still stand beside them</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Dalglish doubts contract theory]</b> <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> signed a new contract that ties him to the club until 2024. It just so happened that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> also signed an extension to tie him to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for the same period. But spare me the notion it all goes hand in hand for Steven to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and replace Jurgen in five years’ time. Listen, I know it’s Christmas time and we all like a good fairy tale. However, nobody – including Jurgen, Steven and me – can look five days into the future, never mind four or five years. For anyone to suggest otherwise is putting two and two together and coming up with 222. So, let’s get back to reality</p>

  <p><b>[After his role in securing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first top-flight title success in 30 years, Dalglish says he has earned his place among the club’s biggest legends]</b> Jordan will be the only <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain who has lifted this trophy and be a Club World Cup winner as well. He is up there with the captains who have picked up the Champions League. <b>[When I signed him]</b> I saw somebody who was better than what we had at that time. That was on the pitch. Then when you get into discussions, he was very balanced, his dad came with him for the conversations which was for me a good sign. He had a secure home life which helps and he was determined to be a success in football. If I hadn’t given him a chance, it would have been me who would have been wrong. I’m not being modest; you see something you like it and you get it<br /><br /><b>[The ex-Scotland hero was quick to give credit to coach <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, too, adding that the German has rare qualities]</b> Obviously <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans and the players adore Jurgen, but there are a lot of opposition fans who think he is a good fella, too. You don’t get that with too many managers. You don’t get that. That is quite unique. Jurgen is the perfect fit for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He is perfect. I am sure he is Scouser. Some people are suited to clubs because of the personality they have and the beliefs they have are similar and that is exactly what Jurgen has.<br /><br />He is very comfortable in himself because he knows what he does is an honest effort and commitment to success, and he doesn’t mind sharing that success. He knows what he is doing is the right way for him. Some people might feel intimidated, but when the club had success there were always people in and around the football club. I think that is important to have that. He is very comfortable and he enjoys sharing the success he has with everybody.</p>

  <p><b>[Sir <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> texts congratulations to Sir Kenny Dalglish on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title win]</b> He <b>[Ferguson]</b> contacted us to say congratulations by the modern medium. You go through the older generation <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="brian-kidd.html">Brian Kidd</a>, Mike Summerbee; all the old foes who went through football at the same time as us and at the end of the year you sent a letter of congratulations to say well done. That continues through. It is a great compliment. You are in competition and rivals, but you are magnanimous enough to send a letter saying congratulations. Everyone is in the same game, aren’t they?<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> This is not the final destination. It’s a moment like last year’s Champions League final. From that moment you carry on, and that’s what we’ll do now</p>
