Everyone in Scotland should be very, very proud of him. You only need to come to a game to sense the respect the punters have for him. They really enjoy watching Andy and he has his own chant already, which I know means a lot to him. Andy’s a quality player. He has pace, his final ball is excellent and he plays with his heart on his sleeve. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see him flying the flag for Scotland.</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Dalglish revealed to the Daily Mirror in 2012]</b> When the Hillsborough disaster happened back in 1989, Sir Alex Ferguson was straight on the phone to offer his help in any way he could. People out there have different opinions about him. Some love him, some hate him, but when something terrible happens, like Hillsborough, Alex is one of the first asking what he can do. So although there is an intense rivalry between Manchester United and Liverpool, it would never prevent Alex from offering his assistance, which is exactly what he did back then.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish believes Philippe Coutinho should be given a warm welcome when he returns to Anfield next month]</b> I would hope that, if there are people there who are Liverpool fans, they would give Coutinho a good reception. There may be people there who are upset that he’s left but they’re entitled to their opinion, but don’t turn up if all you want to do is boo people. I can understand the disappointment because he was fantastic over the past 18 months, but go watch Brazil and watch Firmino and the fantastic times he’s given. With Coutinho, his ability was a good start and the goals he scored from outside the box were tremendously exciting. If you take on Brazil and plan to focus on Coutinho then you’ve only got Neymar to contend with after that. If those two are having a bad time then Bobby Firmino might step up for one - he normally scores at Anfield anyway.<br /><br />When I went to Brazil with Scotland, we lost 2-0 in 1977 and it was preparation for the World Cup in Argentina in the next year - I think I got about four or five touches and three of them were the kick-off. My memories don’t include a win. A few years before that, in 1974, we managed to draw 0-0 in a qualifying game and in 1982 we lost 4-1. We were doing okay in that one, we were holding our own until David Narey scored a goal for us and that upset them so they banged in four after that<br /><br />I don’t think Brazil can play without being entertaining, the last time they played they lost 7-1 to Germany, but I think they’re a lot stronger now than they were then. It would be interesting to see what they’ve got up front, they’ve got some firepower if the starters come off, they’ve got some great, great options. Even defensively which isn’t usually that attractive, they’ve got two fantastic defenders in Thiago Silva and Marquinhos<br /><br />Croatia are not bad either, they’ve got four or five players who play for the top sides in Europe so it’s not going to be an easy game. They have got Real Madrid’s Luka Modric, Mario Mandzukic who’s at Juventus - so they’ve got strong, good players who can cause you problems as well. But everybody loves to watch Brazil. When you see the yellow jersey, there’s something about it - ever since Pele, there’s always be an association with the football fans in Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk and Alisson have Liverpool in a really good place]</b> You never know when your success is going to come, but certainly the January transfer window when they brought in Virgil and the summer when they brought in Alisson Becker - two fantastic signings. Two people with real presence and stature, as well as stopping them at one end and Virgil’s knocked in a couple at the other end! And when you’re confronted with Alisson Becker one on one, he’s an imposing feature to try and knock it past. So they’re two areas we’ve strengthened over the last 12 to 14 months, and that’s fantastic for us. You’ve got two young full-backs, Trent <b>[<a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b> and Robbo <b>[Andrew Robertson]</b> who have done unbelievably well for two young guys. They’ve been really successful in what they’ve done. The front three, you’re not going to look too far away from them three if you’re picking a team and he <b>[Klopp]</b> floats about a bit with the three in the middle, which is important as well. I think we’re in a really good place and you keep your fingers crossed between now and the end of the season and you see what happens. But whether you win the title or you finish second, or you get progress in winning the Champions League or you don’t, I think the positivity in and around the place is brilliant and I think we really are stepping forward and getting closer and closer.<br /><br />We’re closer this year than we were last year, so that’s the most important thing. In the Champions League we got the final last year and lost to Real Madrid, so maybe they’ll say ‘you’re only at the quarter-final stage so that’s not really progress, you’ve not got to the final yet or are not winning it’, but when you compare the progress from last year, you need to win it. So if you don’t win it, is that not progress? I think it’s still progress. Porto in the quarters will be a difficult game but we were convincing winners last year with them, which psychologically might help but it doesn’t get you any goals, so they just need to overcome them first. And then the league, all we can do is play against the people that are put in front of us and they’ve done it successfully so far, so let’s keep our fingers crossed and there’s no reason why they shouldn’t continue that</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool capable of greatest comeback despite threat of magical Messi]</b> Of course, it’s hard to see any team scoring four against Barca to get through. But I do think the tie is still open, and there remains a glimmer of hope. It would be foolish to say the tie is over. Jurgen Klopp said he felt it was the team’s best away performance in two years, and it’s hard to argue with that. Firstly, I believe Liverpool showed in the first leg that they are fitter and stronger than their opponents. Also, with the game being at Anfield, the backing from the home support will drive the players on. There is also a rich history of comebacks by Liverpool in Europe over the years, and that’s why I’d never rule out that being the case again. That said, if the players were to overturn this three-goal deficit against Barcelona, it would be the greatest comeback of them all, no question.<br /><br />In Lionel Messi, Barca also have one of the finest footballers the world has ever seen. He will turn 32 next month but shows no signs of letting up. Messi continues to break record after record, and his hunger to succeed looks every bit as strong as it was 10 or 12 years ago. The way he just glides past players as if they aren’t there is unbelievable. I don’t envy any defender having to try to stifle him. In footballing terms, it’s as close to being as an impossible task as you could get. People always want to get into the debate about whether he is the greatest at the moment, or is it Cristiano Ronaldo? It used to be whether Maradona or Pele was the greatest of all time. As I’ve said many times, it’s all down to opinion. It can’t be factual. My answer is that we are extremely fortunate to have two such outstanding players in the game at the same time and you just enjoy them - not try to compare them</p>

Week in and week out, he has been hugely influential and his contribution has been enormous, what the team gets out of him in every game is remarkable. He quite rightly gets praised to the hilt for what he does in an attacking sense in the wide area, he gets up and down and creates plenty of chances for his team-mates. But he also has been outstanding in a defensive sense, too. Sometimes that tends to get overlooked. Andy just needs to keep showing the same application and focus that he has in the past five or six years. If it was good enough to get him to where he is now then he shouldn’t change anything</p>

The <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> left-back has been linked with a move away, and there have been regular news stories about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> being interested in the 22-year-old. The other piece of the jigsaw is that the <a href="celtic-fc.html">Parkhead</a> hierarchy are holding out for a straight £25 million fee for their player. Of course, the identities of the clubs that may or may not be chasing him - and the amount of money it would take to land him - have never been officially confirmed as nobody has gone on the record to put everyone fully in the picture. But we know how these things work.<br /><br />Kieran hasn’t gone public on the situation. But it would fair to say that perhaps he feels the time is right to try something different, and there is a curiosity as to what might be out there for him. There is nothing wrong with that. He is perfectly entitled to explore any options that may come his way. Whatever happens, to date he has given four years of outstanding service to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, and that should never be forgotten or tarnished. But he is also powerless in many ways as he can’t officially get involved until his club have agreed a fee and given him permission to talk about the length of contract and salary with a particular club. So, unless the valuation is met, there is a stalemate. <a href="celtic-fc.html">The Hoops</a> have every right to play hardball, and get what they believe to be a proper valuation. That could mean that the lad ends up staying at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic FC</a>.</p>

It’s a hypothetical scenario, but one that I can see the sense in. I’m sure Jurgen is only echoing the thoughts of most of the club’s supporters. However, let’s be clear. Jurgen is going nowhere, and nobody with the club at heart wants to see him depart. He may have led the club to the Champions League last season, the biggest prize in European football. But there is much more he still wants to achieve - in particular <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first league title since 1990 - and this season has started very well. But the time will come when he decides it’s time to take a break, and nobody would be critical of him for doing so. At some stage, everybody needs a rest, a time to draw breath and take stock<br /><br />When that scenario unfolds, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, I’m quite certain, will come into the thoughts of everyone at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He knows the club inside out and is proving himself to be a very capable young manager at Rangers. Jurgen didn’t say what he did in order to angle a move away from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for himself, or to unsettle Steven at Ibrox. He was just speaking honestly. For me, the way Jurgen answered the question put to him once again reiterated just how much he ‘gets’ <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, from the way some people are regarded by everyone at the club to the mood and feelings of the supporters. Perhaps Steven might have been a wee bit embarrassed with Jurgen’s comments, but they would have been said with the best of intentions. Deep down inside, I’m sure Steven would have been very, very proud of Jurgen’s comments. But right now he has a job at Rangers to be getting on with, just as Jurgen will be fully focused on matters at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. Steven is doing very well at Ibrox. He has improved the team, and helped the club make huge strides forward off the park. The next step, of course, is to try to win silverware</p>

It just so happened that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> also signed an extension to tie him to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for the same period. But spare me the notion it all goes hand in hand for Steven to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and replace Jurgen in five years’ time. Listen, I know it’s Christmas time and we all like a good fairy tale. However, nobody - including Jurgen, Steven and me - can look five days into the future, never mind four or five years. For anyone to suggest otherwise is putting two and two together and coming up with 222. So, let’s get back to reality</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Dalglish says We can’t allow this season to count for nothing]</b> Would any person without an agenda really think it would be the most-sensible outcome to deny <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> their chance of winning the title after doing fantastically well in their 29 league games so far to build up a 25-point lead over <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> with nine games remaining? My first thought is that we must be given time to finish the competitions in our own backyard. If that means we need to play every second night for three weeks during May, or even into June, then so be it. It’s far from ideal, I know, but every club would be in the same boat, so it would be a level playing field. What must definitely not happen is for the 2019-20 campaign to be declared null and void<br /><br />We just need to hope that in the short term, as many people as possible are safe and well and free from the virus. Football is quite rightly playing second fiddle to worldwide health issues, and we can never underestimate the importance of it all. That, of course, is my main concern just now and I wish everyone well and good health</p>

Obviously, bearing in mind that health and security is very important for players and everybody else involved. Get that right, see what happens and see how you feel, then you decide if you’ll call it quits<br /><br />It’s difficult to handle it.

But, by the way, it shows you the power of strength mentally he is, and actually how talented he is.

  <p><b>[After his role in securing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first top-flight title success in 30 years, Dalglish says he has earned his place among the club’s biggest legends]</b> Jordan will be the only <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain who has lifted this trophy and be a Club World Cup winner as well. He is up there with the captains who have picked up the Champions League. <b>[When I signed him]</b> I saw somebody who was better than what we had at that time. That was on the pitch. Then when you get into discussions, he was very balanced, his dad came with him for the conversations which was for me a good sign. He had a secure home life which helps and he was determined to be a success in football. If I hadn’t given him a chance, it would have been me who would have been wrong. I’m not being modest; you see something you like it and you get it<br /><br /><b>[The ex-Scotland hero was quick to give credit to coach <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, too, adding that the German has rare qualities]</b> Obviously <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans and the players adore Jurgen, but there are a lot of opposition fans who think he is a good fella, too. You don’t get that with too many managers. You don’t get that. That is quite unique. Jurgen is the perfect fit for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He is perfect. I am sure he is Scouser. Some people are suited to clubs because of the personality they have and the beliefs they have are similar and that is exactly what Jurgen has.<br /><br />He is very comfortable in himself because he knows what he does is an honest effort and commitment to success, and he doesn’t mind sharing that success. He knows what he is doing is the right way for him. Some people might feel intimidated, but when the club had success there were always people in and around the football club. I think that is important to have that. He is very comfortable and he enjoys sharing the success he has with everybody.</p>
