<blockquote>
  <p>Final election results released late on Wednesday evening – six weeks after the vote itself – confirmed that the opposition Pheu Thai party won 136 seats in the 500-member lower house, beating the pro-military proxy party of the junta on 97 seats<br /><br />Part of the delay in announcing the final results has been due to confusion about the last 150 of the 500 lower house seats, which are awarded proportionately by the election commission based on each party’s total of the nationwide popular vote. Yet bizarrely, the commission said on Wednesday that while the second placed party of General <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> would receive an extra 18 of the ‘party list’ seats, Pheu Thai would receive none<br /><br />Pheu Thai and a coalition of pro-democracy parties calculated, based on preliminary results, they would have around 255 of the 500 seats – giving them a claim to have first go at forming a government. The way the seats were ultimately allocated meant they had just 245, prompting widespread accusations on social media that the election commission had deliberately interpreted the formula for the party list seats in a way that ensured Pheu Thai fell short of a majority<br /><br />Anon Chawalawan, a researcher from the Thai human rights and transparency NGO iLaw, told The Independent the election commission had awarded seats to tiny political parties that won as few as 30,000 votes nationwide, rather than giving them to the major opposition bloc, in a way that appeared contrary to the rules set out for proportional representation in the constitution<br /><br />Pheu Thai issued a statement saying the election commission ‘deliberately intended to commit wrongdoing and misused its power, violating the constitution and the law. The party will later take legal measures in every aspect against the election commission,’ it said<br /><br />The scale of fraud on election day was ‘unprecedented’ in Thailand, the report’s lead author Dr <a href="pavin-chachavalpongpun.html">Pavin Chachavalpongpun</a> told The Independent. Irregularities included the state tampering with ballot boxes, using unauthorised vehicles to transport ballots, deliberately destroyed campaigning materials of opposing parties, as well as the obvious tactic of vote-buying.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the election commission reduced its seat total to 80, further hurting the chances of the pro-democratic alliance which it too had joined. The party’s secretary-general, <a href="piyabutr-saengkanokkul.html">Piyabutr Saengkanokkul</a>, called the commission’s calculations ‘absurd’</p>
