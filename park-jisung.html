  <p><b>[Park Ji Sung when asked by the club’s official home page which United player he would like to see in the red shirt of the Taeguk Warriors]</b> It has to be Paul Scholes</p>

  <p><b>[Ji-Sung Park says he is flattered by comparisons with Chelsea star N’Golo Kante]</b> I believe that tweet is not based on facts. Basically, he is playing in a different position to me. He is a defensive midfielder and I was more a winger although I sometimes played in the middle. But I believe fans are linking me and him because his work rate is so great, and he contributes a lot for both defence and attack. But, of course I’m glad that fans are talking about me when they see Kante. I believe that means I showed some character in my playing days.<br /><br />I think the Europa League win will be a huge plus for Man Utd. For me what is important for next season is the players who haven’t experienced the Champions League to do well, and how new players will adapt with current players. I believe Jose Mourinho’s ability to get results in tournaments will also help Man United. I think he can bring Alex Ferguson’s competitiveness back to Man United. He got two cups in his first season and brought them back to the Champions League. I believe that will help United to regain confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has Manchester United emerging from a post-Sir Alex Ferguson dark tunnel]</b> We’re almost through that dark tunnel. After Sir Alex Ferguson it’s been a difficult time for Man United, but actually many people know that after Sir Alex Ferguson it would be difficult for Man United. Now you can see this season the performance is great. Hopefully it will be the same as under Sir Alex Ferguson.<br /><br /><b>[Park added on Mourinho’s influence in turning the tide at Old Trafford]</b> He knows more about Man United now. His second season is always good. In his first season, he knows what the club wanted. He found some things, brought in some players who he wanted and now it looks strong<br /><br />I know in this moment it’s two clubs that really fight each other, but the season’s long and I know Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool all compete during the season. Always the Premier League has several clubs fighting for the title. At the moment, it looks like two clubs. We need to show our quality and don’t think about other clubs, like Man City. The season’s long, just focus on what they <b>[United]</b> have done because they’ve done so well and if we can continue with that then I think we can win the title again</p>

  <p><b>[Park Ji-sung believes Andrea Pirlo was among the ‘best in the world’ around the time of a famous duel between Manchester United and AC Milan]</b> He was not a big player physically, but his ability in passing, taking free-kicks, shooting from distance, play-making was the best in the world at that time. I believe he was a great player who could dictate the game. He was the biggest threat to any team who played against his team.<br /><br />Man Utd analysed Milan’s game and concluded that Pirlo is the key man for them. Sir Alex Ferguson made me man-mark Pirlo. So, I tried to block him so that he cannot be in possession of the ball. When he had the ball, I tried to prevent him passing the ball in front of him. To mark Pirlo was not easy. It was hard mentally, physically but consequently Milan had a difficult game against us<br /><br />On one of the many occasions when our paths crossed <b>[Pirlo’s, and Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> during my time at Milan, he unleashed Park Ji-sung to shadow me. The midfielder must have been the first nuclear-powered South Korean in history, in the sense that he rushed about the pitch at the speed of an electron</p>

  <p><b>[Park Jisung speaks about who he sees as the favourites at Russia 2018]</b> Brazil have been doing very well and Germany are very strong, but it’s a tough question, particularly for this tournament. It will be so exciting to see because it’s very difficult to choose one team as a favourite for this World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba must learn to deal with being blamed for Manchester United’s shortcomings]</b> It’s inevitable, he is a star player in the team who gets enormous interest from people. It’s obvious that the blame will be on him if the team is not doing well. But on the other hand, he will be the one praised when the team is doing well. He has to overcome the situation. He’s a positive player, so I think he wouldn’t really mind. I’m sure he can get over it.<br /><br />He wasn’t a first-team player. He was an academy player sometimes called up in training and matches. He was physically and technically excellent, and a lot of people talked about him. He was famous even when he was an academy player. There was no doubt he would become a first-team player one day. It was just a matter of how big a player he would become</p>

  <p><b>[Park Ji-sung says Son Heung-Min has given hope to ‘all Asian players and fans’ with his performances for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> this season]</b> He is doing an excellent job at the moment for sure. He is developing season by season and he makes the fans to expect even more for the next season. I believe he is giving hopes to all Asian players and fans, and I hope he can go even higher than now.<br /><br /><b>[That could leave Park as a candidate as who is the best ever Asian player. Instead, he points to Cha Bum-kun, a forward who starred in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> in the 70’s and 80’s for <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> and Bayer Leverkusen]</b> For me, it’s not me, not him, but Cha Bum-kun. We need to wait and see whether Son can surpass Cha in the future. Personally, I hope Son can go even further than Cha because it would mean South Korea keeps producing the best Asian players. For that, I hope Son to get the title of ‘best Asian player ever’ in the future<br /><br /><b>[Park enjoyed Son’s goals against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> in the Champions League, saying they were reflective of the player]</b> Personally, I never scored a goal against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and I felt thanks to Son because <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> lost the game. The goals from Son were very much like himself. He was absolutely brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Park Ji-sung has praised the football vision of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>]</b> I believe he was the best man for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> at that time. He was interim manager which was a very good option for both the club and Ole because they both have an opportunity. Ole was different in the way he watches football. When he was watching the game from the bench, he was always thinking about ‘how can I change the game when I get into the pitch’. It’s not an easy way of thinking, and I believe it was a perfect attitude for every player.<br /><br />I believe there was a psychological issue. At the beginning of his time as a manager at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, there was a strong motivation for finishing top four and also Champions League. But, after they knocked out of the Champions League, and lost a game in the league, they suffered from the pressure. I believe that kind of psychological pressure was hard for the players. About next season, it’s important for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> to support their manager. Supporting the manager to get the players he wants. The quicker, the better, so that new players can spend the pre-season together with the current team</p>
