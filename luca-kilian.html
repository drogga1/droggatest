After the all-clear for head coach Steffen Baumgart, central defender Luca Kilian, who has not been used for a few weeks due to an injury, has tested positively. In close coordination with the local authorities, the SCP07 will take extensive measures to contain the coronavirus. Tomorrow, Saturday, the players and all members of the functional team will undergo a corona virus test</p>

  <p><b>[Luca Kilian on Coronavirus symptoms]</b> On March 12 I had the first of my hot flushes and a day later they were really strong. Fever and strong shivers. It was then I started being really scared for the first time. It took four days for the fever to drop, and after that I felt better every day. I’m a sportsman and in form, but I had to fight a lot against the virus. For the people who already have health issues, it could put their life in danger</p>
