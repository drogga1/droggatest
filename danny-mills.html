What did I do wrong? It was a foul, I was on the floor, all he said was to stay down, I didn’t roll around squirming and squealing, I just stayed dead still</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Mills says Jack Clarke is making the wrong move in leaving Leeds for Tottenham]</b> You have to say if a player is that good at 18-19 years old, whoever you are, you have had more starts for a Championship side. You’re coming off the bench and it’s easier to pick the ball up and run at people, why has Bielsa said ‘you are not worthy of more starts?’. I actually think it’s the wrong move, is he going to be in the Tottenham team next season? No chance.<br /><br /><b>[Mills added on Clarke making a questionable call so early in his career]</b> He’s too young, he is going to be nowhere near the first team, there’s a lot of potential there, but at this stage it is very, very raw and it is purely potential. Next season he might’ve had 15-20 starts and had the opportunity to impress, he now goes to Tottenham and at best he’s going to be in the U23 squad. Playing games week in week out is what he needs to do, I think this could actually send his career a bit backwards because he is not going to play football</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Mills recalls <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> European tie to explain effects of playing without fans amid coronavirus fears]</b> We had a <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> cup game and it was very similar to playing behind closed doors. I think we played Partizan Belgrade when all the troubles were happening in Eastern Europe and that had to be moved, I think we played it in Holland, and there were very few fans there. It’s unusual, it’s difficult. It’s a little bit like playing a reserve team game, it’s not the same. You want fans, you feed off the fans’ energy but we are now in a time of needs-must.<br /><br />We were happy to play the game, you get on with it as a player, it’s your job. Yes, you want fans in the ground but if it can’t happen, it can’t happen. We’ve seen internationals already played behind closed doors because of sanctions imposed on them for different reasons. We have seen these games before, players have dealt with it, it is not the end of the world. If it’s okay to do that and that’s the best way to do it, carry on</p>

It’s not that complicated. I get that the government doesn’t want to miss out on taxes. It’s a valid point but there are ways around that. Everything is new at the moment. This is new at the moment, and there are new things coming into law all the time. The will is there from the players. The players want to help out, I can’t stress that enough, it’s quite clear. <br /><br />The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players have the ability to do so and the funds to do so, some in the Championship might too but some may not. Some in League One and League Two will not, things could be very tight in their lives and they may not get help further along. Allow <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to help out. It’s making footballers look bad at the moment. <br /><br />I understand the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a>, and the strength is in their numbers, but all the power lies at the top. They’re the ones with the say. They’re the ones with the money and the power. The <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> are making them look bad at the moment. The players want to give money, they want to help, now why’s it taken almost three weeks to get these talks to a point where we can’t even get a conclusion. That doesn’t seem right. The <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> have been slow to react and their communication hasn’t been brilliant. We’ve seen <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> doing something off his own back to get players to donate and help out. The goodwill of the players is there but the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> seem to be putting a blockage in the way.</p>

When you have a bad game you’re an easy target. That’s what happens.<br /><br />Of course it is. If you go out with your socks around your ankles and you look a bit scruffy and you have a poor game, the first thing any football coach will say is ‘look at him, his attitude is sloppy’. That might not be true, but that’s the image you give off.<br /><br />So when <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s going out and all he’s talking about is social media and sponsorship deals and all these other things, it looks as though he’s not giving 100 per cent to football.

He’s not been good enough. It doesn’t give the right impression, that’s the whole point of it. If you’re playing well then you can do these things and act in the manner.
