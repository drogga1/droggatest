  <p><b>[Danny Mills recalls <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> European tie to explain effects of playing without fans amid coronavirus fears]</b> We had a <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> cup game and it was very similar to playing behind closed doors. I think we played Partizan Belgrade when all the troubles were happening in Eastern Europe and that had to be moved, I think we played it in Holland, and there were very few fans there. It’s unusual, it’s difficult. It’s a little bit like playing a reserve team game, it’s not the same. You want fans, you feed off the fans’ energy but we are now in a time of needs-must.<br /><br />We were happy to play the game, you get on with it as a player, it’s your job. Yes, you want fans in the ground but if it can’t happen, it can’t happen. We’ve seen internationals already played behind closed doors because of sanctions imposed on them for different reasons. We have seen these games before, players have dealt with it, it is not the end of the world. If it’s okay to do that and that’s the best way to do it, carry on</p>

What did I do wrong? It was a foul, I was on the floor, all he said was to stay down, I didn’t roll around squirming and squealing, I just stayed dead still</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling’s new Manchester City contract is partly responsible for Pep Guardiola’s rant at the England international after a derby victory over Manchester United]</b> It was different in my day. He might end up in the back of the stands. <b>[Marouane]</b> Fellaini doesn’t get particularly close to him. <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez doesn’t really get that close to him. They don’t try and take the ball. I think there’s two things. One, Pep likes to keep the ball moving. That’s the way he plays. That’s his philosophy. Secondly, Sterling has just signed a new contract. Big bumper deal that Pep has been a big part of. Is this just a little reminder of - OK, you’ve got this deal, but don’t get too big for your boots just yet?.<br /><br />I think they have learned and developed. Last season it was ‘we are going to play this way no matter what’. All-out attack, pass, pass, pass, and they came unstuck against Liverpool. We’ve already seen this season that Pep has just changed it slightly against some of those big teams and been a little bit more guarded at times. <b>[Benjamin]</b> Mendy’s come in at left-back, which I think has added to them defensively. Kyle Walker doesn’t have to go as far forward down the right-hand side, he can tuck in and be a bit more defensive. <b>[Aymeric]</b> Laporte is looking very, very good defensively so I think they’ve developed slightly. In those bigger games they now have the nous and knowhow of how to win a game and grind it out at times which is what they will have to do</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba must improve his performance level for Manchester United]</b> Pogba has to pull his finger out. He’s got a lot of ability and he does it for France. Whether he wants to do it for the manager or in spite of the manager, he’s just got to go out and do it. That’s his job.<br /><br />What I do find amazing is there is clearly an agenda against Mourinho, whether we like it or not, especially in the media. Unai Emery gets lauded for leaving Ozil out of the squad. ‘Don’t want to be there? Right, you’re not playing’. Arsenal win a few games: ‘it’s one of the best decisions ever, he’s being brave’. Mourinho drops Lukaku who’s been poor, he leaves out Pogba who’s been poor and it’s a massive problem. ‘You can’t be doing this, he’s their best player’. I think Mourinho does get treated differently. A lot of that is brought on by himself at times. He likes the controversy, he likes the spotlight and he likes to bring attention on himself. Sometimes, he is treated differently from other managers and whether that’s right or wrong, it’s just a fact.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle’s record signing Miguel Almiron will shut up ignorant critics]</b> I’ve never really heard of him, in all honesty. It’s not a signing that makes you go ‘Oh wow, this is inspiring’. It may be a record signing but it’s not that stellar signing who you know is going to score goals. He is very much an unknown. He might take time to settle as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Aguero is three or four years ahead of where Gabriel Jesus wants to be]</b> In and around the box his <b>[Aguero’s]</b> movement and his sharpness is class. When he plays for Man City he adds a different dimension. He is three or four years ahead of where Jesus wants to be, if he’s fit he is first name on the teamsheet.<br /><br />They scored after 23 seconds and you think is it going to be three, four? They didn’t kick on, they never put them <b>[Newcastle]</b> to the sword, which is not like them at all. Newcastle were resolute and made them pay on the counter-attack and it’s a massive blow for City who could have put the pressure on Liverpool. Complacency could have been a factor the other night, all of a sudden you get to half-time, it’s one nil and Newcastle have a bit of belief. It was a huge opportunity missed. It doesn’t take a lot for the top sides to become normal almost, maybe even a five to 10 per cent drop off. For Manchester City and Liverpool this is now all about pressure now, and who can deal with it best</p>

  <p><b>[The Premier League title race has swung massively in Manchester City’s favour]</b> Liverpool have had a bit of a blip, I think that’s all it is at the moment. But the pressure has swung massively in Man City’s favour. Liverpool had a nine-point lead not so long ago, that’s gone. For City to go ahead, even when they’ve lost recently, the likes of the Newcastle game, now the pressure is all on Liverpool. City have been there, they’ve done it, they’ve won the league several times in the last few years, Liverpool are approaching 30 years since they last won the title - it’s the last little hurdle to finally get it. Can they do it? It’s maybe a bit of belief, the manager’s done it in Germany but not too many of these players have. There’s one or two nerves creeping in now, but Pep’s City just play. They are bothered about results, but he says play this way no matter what, and it brings results ultimately. Liverpool don’t have that luxury.</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola would not be too upset if Manchester City slipped up in their latest trophy quest]</b> I think for Pep, it’s difficult. The FA Cup is not really on his radar. If City were to win the FA Cup and the League Cup and nothing else, it would be considered a failure with the squad they’ve got and how good they were last season. That sounds ridiculous; you win two trophies and it’s been a poor season. But I think the fans would go with the league, they want to retain that - they still haven’t fallen in love with the Champions League because of the issues with Financial Fair Play and the amount of players you are allowed in the squad. I think the owners want the Champions League, that’s what they came in to do - it’s the toss of a coin, they’d probably take one or the other. There’s a huge split between everybody, fans, owners, players, manager - and Pep’s not won it with another club so he might want it</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Foden is almost too good to go out on loan]</b> He <b>[Foden]</b> is almost too good to go out on loan, nobody’s going to buy him for what City want for him, i.e. £40 million or £50 million because he’s unproven. But he’s got untold ability and I think this time next year if he’s only started maybe 10 games then he’s going to have a real decision to make because it’s his boyhood club and he’s a fan<br /><br />He’s only 18 years old but he’ll be looking at the likes of Callum Hudson-Odoi who also made his first Premier League start, but he <b>[Hudson-Odoi]</b> is in the England side. And he might go to the mini-tournament <b>[Nations League]</b> in the summer and off the back of that he might go to the Euros. Foden’s going to be sat there thinking ‘you know what, I’m as good as that, I’m even better than that, I want a piece of that action’. But to get it, he might have to force a move on loan or on a permanent basis but that’s probably another 12 months down the line</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool and Manchester City would happily trade places in the Premier League and Champions League]</b> In an ideal world they would have swapped roles. City would have loved to be in a Champions League final. Maybe not the fans but the club and where that takes them to a global level. Liverpool would quite happily be a point ahead going into the last game of the season and if they win they win the league. At the moment the league is probably a little more important to Liverpool because they haven’t won it for such a long time. The Champions League, in terms of where City are, is a little bit more important but it hasn’t worked out like that</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana would be perfect for Manchester City]</b> You almost forget about him but he is very gifted and a talented footballer. I would almost say he more fits the Man City style, he’d be perfect for them with his short, darting runs and clever runs in behind. As you start to get older, you realise you are not invincible and your career is not going to go on forever. Liverpool will definitely want to keep him but it might come down to him wanting to reignite his career. If that’s the case, he’s going to go. He’s such a good player he won’t be short of interested clubs.<br /><br />It’s a difficult situation for him to get back in the <b>[Liverpool]</b> team. It’s a scenario that many players would find difficult. But what would be the tough thing is would the supporters welcome players <b>[like Lallana]</b> back to the club? It’s a relationship between the two clubs that has certainly spiked the nerves of Southampton fans with a lot of our top players leaving for Liverpool. I just like to see good, talented and passionate players that want to play for Southampton - playing for my team. However that happens, I’m quite open to anything</p>

No chance.<br /><br /><b>[Mills added on Clarke making a questionable call so early in his career]</b> He’s too young, he is going to be nowhere near the first team, there’s a lot of potential there, but at this stage it is very, very raw and it is purely potential. Next season he might’ve had 15-20 starts and had the opportunity to impress, he now goes to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and at best he’s going to be in the U23 squad. Playing games week in week out is what he needs to do, I think this could actually send his career a bit backwards because he is not going to play football</p>

The goodwill of the players is there but the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> seem to be putting a blockage in the way.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Mills has launched an attack on <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is one of the most active players on social media. He will see every time his name is mentioned and what he’s associated with.<br /><br />If you put yourself out there with dyeing your hair, with sponsorship deals and this, that and the other <b>[…]</b> you are putting yourself out there to be criticised the way he goes on. When you have a bad game you’re an easy target. That’s what happens.<br /><br />Of course it is. If you go out with your socks around your ankles and you look a bit scruffy and you have a poor game, the first thing any football coach will say is ‘look at him, his attitude is sloppy’. That might not be true, but that’s the image you give off.<br /><br />So when <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s going out and all he’s talking about is social media and sponsorship deals and all these other things, it looks as though he’s not giving 100 per cent to football. That’s what you get judged on. If they are not playing well that is one of the first criticisms that will come to people’s mind.<br /><br />If you’re (Brazilian) <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and you can perform at the very highest level then you can have a silly haircut like he did<br /><br />He hasn’t played well. He’s not been good enough. It doesn’t give the right impression, that’s the whole point of it. If you’re playing well then you can do these things and act in the manner. The moment you stop playing well people will use it as a stick to beat you with. It’s as simple as that. And it doesn’t matter who you are. It doesn’t look like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is his only focus</p>

If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> want Sane I am pretty sure he would go there given the opportunity. Why wouldn’t you? We have seen players do far worse. It is not a Manchester United-Liverpool or a Leeds-Manchester United. The rivalry is not of that ilk.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Mills believes <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>’s achievement is akin to the success enjoyed by <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Bringing <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> in was a big gamble. It was an expensive gamble and no one quite knew which way it would go. Everybody hoped he would do what he’s done. It’s been tremendous, to take a team from 13th in the table - effectively the same group of players, with a few loanees - to third, and now promotion. It’s simply phenomenal. Everybody lauds <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and how great he’s been over the last four or five seasons. <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>’s achievement is not far off that</p>
