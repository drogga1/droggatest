I remember that one day we were watching El Clasico I said to my father: ‘Someday I will play here’. As it turned out, I did, and it was the greatest sensation that one can feel. It’s true that Juventus have an incredible stadium too, but this is the Bernabeu, you just see photos and you get goosebumps. It was my dream, and I was lucky enough to achieve it<br /><br />I have been fortunate to win titles at Real Madrid and Juventus. But my life’s dream, apart from lifting the Champions League again with Real Madrid, would be to win anything with the national team. I would love to win something with the national team, although I know it’s difficult, because you cannot improve on what that phenomenal generation has done</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has admitted he misses Juventus]</b> I am not Italian, but I gave everything for the Bianconero shirt and I was willing to stay there many years. Juventus knew that. The only problem was that Madrid had been my dream since when I was little. Without the buy-back option, you would have had to drive me to get me away from Turin! I miss the Italian group from the dressing room - <b>[Leonardo]</b> Bonucci, <b>[Andrea]</b> Barzagli, <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini, <b>[Claudio]</b> Marchisio, <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon, they were key in my adaptation to Juventus and Turin.

I admit I wouldn’t like it, but just to be there I would sign for it. If I had to lose a final, I would prefer to lose against Juventus over losing to other teams. But now we need to focus on Napoli <b>[Real’s last 16 opponents]</b>. If we think about a hypothetical final, Napoli will send us home</p>

For sure I want to score more than 30 goals, but I would prefer to score 15 or 20 and for us to win the Premier League or another big trophy. I want to score many goals but the most important thing is the team.<br /><br /><b>[Morata believes he can flourish under Sarri]</b> I think we play good football when we have the ball. We need to improve on small things but it’s only been one month since we’ve all been together with the manager and I think if we continue like this we can play against any team in the world. I’m very happy because it was three very important points against Arsenal. In the Premier League I think if you win your first five games you’re in the fight because here in every game you can lose or drop points</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has admitted that he considered leaving Chelsea for a return to either Spain or Italy before the transfer window closed]</b> Last year I wasn’t happy. I started well but at the end it was a disaster. I went out to the pitch and did even not know where I was. I considered returning to Spain or Italy. But you can’t always escape reality, I left Spain to earn a place at the World Cup and I did not go. It was hard. I’m going to do everything I can to go to the next one, it was a difficult time because I expected to go. I didn’t have the best season. The boss took a decision. I don’t resent <b>[Julen]</b> Lopetegui, I wish him all the best at Real Madrid.<br /><br />There was never an option to return to Real Madrid this summer<br /><br />I feel like it’s the first time, I was nervous yesterday, I arrived an hour and a half early. Luis Enrique tells us that he wants Spain to win again and that everyone knows who Spain are. There are times when I stopped appreciating coming here. You do not think about every match you play with the Spanish national team until you have to watch the matches from home<br /><br />We have not been given much different instructions. Each coach is different and asks for their own things. It was a simple presentation, each coach has his style, we are all happy, it was just an introduction. I like him at the moment as a coach. We have had two training sessions, he asks for a lot of intensity, a lot of concentration. He seems to me a very sincere person who wants to win</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata says he fell back too heavily on excuses during a bad period in his life last season]</b> In football, physical condition is very important, but the head is the most important thing. If you don’t have the head, if the mentality is not good, then you are in trouble. I had a period where everything - if it is raining, I’m angry because it’s raining. If I miss, it’s because the pitch is too wet. It was only excuses. It is not good. Everyone can have a bad period in their life, but we are famous, we have a lot of things. Sometimes people think we are not human, with no feelings, with no problems. The important thing is to find the right balance. Now, I have, and I am very happy. I’m better. In the last month of last season, I was down, down, down, down. I cannot be more down. When you touch the limit, the only thing you can do is to come back<br /><br />In the last 10 minutes, I only have in my head, ‘I want to bring the ball home’, and I think that’s why I missed. If I don’t think, probably I score. At the end of the season, if we want to fight for the Premier League, I need to score many goals, Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> has to score many goals, the other strikers, Willian, Pedro, <b>[Ross]</b> Barkley. There is Hazard, there is <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino, <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero, <b>[Harry]</b> Kane. This is the league with the best strikers in the world. I don’t need to think about scoring more goals than other players</p>

I prefer winning something and scoring less goals, but I will be so happy if I score a lot of goals and we win trophies this season. I’m a striker, it’s our job and it’s true that we need to score, and I am happy when I do.</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata aims sly dig at Conte’s Chelsea tactics as he embraces ‘perfect’ Sarriball]</b> I was told that he’s a coach who plays very well with the ball and loves tactical work, but he also has a good personal relationship with the players. Sarri knows perfectly the difference between the various moments in the life of a squad: when you need to work he’s like a general and is the first to set the example when it’s time to joke he can have you dying of laughter. That’s all reflected in the group, we’re getting on well together and we’re playing good football. The only reason we’re a little behind in the table is that we’ve had some draws. We haven’t been with Sarri for a long time though, we haven’t lost yet and that’s good because the competition is very tough in the Premier League. And we’ll improve. I was surprised that to talk to him you don’t need something to have happened, you’re injured or playing badly, or well. He’s always available and interested, he wants to know how you are, how your life is. Football issues, sure but also, I don’t know … the political situation in your country.<br /><br />One of the first times I met him, he asked me what I thought of Basque independence. I gasped, I didn’t expect that! We then talked about it passionately, and that’s something about him that’s not so obvious. His system is perfect for me, almost all the balls come to me when I’m in front of goal, and it’s much better than when I was playing with my back to goal and had to turn around - that’s not my game. One of the places I played best was Juventus, and there too I didn’t have to turn around, I just had to attack the space and run forward with the ball. That’s the same as now, and I’d have been able to score a few more goals if I’d been more precise.</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has revealed the difficulties he suffered at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and is desperate for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to sign him permanently]</b> I had lost confidence in myself previously. I was very upset by the opinion of the people in England. I think they caught me in the middle of everything. I didn’t quite feel loved or appreciated by the club or the fans. I started very well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but an injury in the end leaves you a bit stuck. As bad as it was, I still scored 15 goals and won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup… but I was out of the World Cup, and for me that was the hardest thing that could happen to me in my life. I’ve dreamed of being able to play in a World Cup since I was 10 years old, and I chose <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because I thought it would be the best club to later be able to play in the World Cup. Now, signing for Atletico has been the best thing that could happen to me in my life.<br /><br />I had a very bad time in London. In the end I was training alone. I talked to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and he told me some things that I knew were not going to be as he had said. I was very nervous. My wife was in shock with me. I already knew that I could sign for Atletico if everything went well, and they had four games previously <b>[before Morata officially signed for them on January 29]</b>. I saw them all at home with my wife and she was amazed! She does not like football very much, and she did not understand how I could get like this, so crazy, watching Atletico games, screeching at home, nervous, when I was not an Atletico player yet. It’s a story I’d like to tell very slowly in the future. I went from being tied on the same amount of goals as <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at the start of the first year, and people made a song about me, I could not even go out in London! And one day I get up with a shooting pain in my back, my level goes down, and they start telling me everything <b>[referring to criticism about him]</b> in England. You are supposed to be respected by fans, but you know….<br /><br />I think in the end it was destiny <b>[moving back to Atletico]</b>. I left Atletico, and every so often I had the opportunity to return, although not so often when I was younger. When you have a bad time in a place, you don’t have that chance often <b>[to return]</b>. It motivated me a lot that <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> called me, no matter the club I was at, and told me that I could be important in Atletico. The people have welcomed me warmly here, even in the difficult situation that it was. The squad and the club staff have changed my life. As I arrive at the training centre, you can see in people’s faces when they trust you. When you are in the dressing room ahead a game, you see how your team-mates look at you.<br /><br />At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> there came a time when my team-mates, except for the Spaniards, well… you know, it is not the same when you play and you know that you give a pass to someone who is not going to do as well. You do not give the pass in the same way. Everyone who has played football once will understand that.

I want to stay at Atletico but, contractually, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can call me back.

So, I know what to expect<br /><br />I had lost confidence in myself previously. I was very upset by the opinion of the people in England. I think they caught me in the middle of everything. I didn’t quite feel loved or appreciated by the club or the fans. I started very well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but an injury, in the end, leaves you a bit stuck.

You do not give the pass in the same way. Everyone who has played football once will understand that. And, in the end, it is a situation that you cannot control: it is neither about being positive or negative or about trying to have fun or being worried.
