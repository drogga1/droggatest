  <p><b>[Spain forward Alvaro Morata says he is ready to fight for a starting spot in his second spell with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> In the two years at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I learned so much about what I should not do when I was in Madrid: get onto the pitch anxious to try to prove everything in a few minutes. Since that first experience in Madrid, I have grown so much. <b>[Fernando]</b> <a href="fernando-morientes.html">Morientes</a>, who was my idol, he told me that I had to leave and then return. I listened to him and I did well. It is clear that if I had gone to another team, I would have played more, but Real is my dream and I want to try to make it happen</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata reveals the secret behind his strong heading ability]</b> When I was seven or eight, I got a trampoline. My dad used to say to me all the time, ‘come on with the head’ and then pass the ball to me as I jumped. I really think it’s helped my heading game because I practiced this all the time with my dad. I found it funny when I was little to jump high and head or kick the ball, but it helped me for the future as well because the aerial game is one of my good points</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata says <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> must respect <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>’s wishes to leave the club]</b> If you’re inside the dressing room, you know it’s a possibility <b>[he will leave]</b>. The only thing to do is to respect him. He’s been one of the best in the club’s history; he’s given so much to Atletico. We have to support him. He’s treated me very well. We wish him well, as long as he doesn’t play against Atletico, of course.<br /><br /><b>[Morata thinks it would be a far bigger loss if Atleti’s head coach opts to leave the club]</b> It would be very difficult to understand Atletico without <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a>. There have been a lot of players, but Atletico always fight since <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a> came. He’d be a great loss. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> is Atletico. You can’t imagine them without him<br /><br /><b>[Morata is also disappointed to see defensive stalwarts <a href="diego-godin.html">Diego Godin</a> and Juanfran leaving]</b> Atletico are losing two legends on the pitch, two leaders. They’ve helped me a lot. I wish I could have played with them more. I’ve experienced difficult times, like in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>, and that’s where the character of great people, of champions comes through<br /><br /><b>[Morata admits <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, inspired by <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, were simply too strong this term]</b> We hope we’ll become a competitive team. We’ve not had luck and we know you need that for the Champions League or to win <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a>. It’s small details. It’s not like Italy or France, where it’s won by a lot of points.

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has revealed the difficulties he suffered at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and is desperate for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to sign him permanently]</b> I had lost confidence in myself previously. I was very upset by the opinion of the people in England. I think they caught me in the middle of everything. I didn’t quite feel loved or appreciated by the club or the fans. I started very well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but an injury in the end leaves you a bit stuck. As bad as it was, I still scored 15 goals and won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup… but I was out of the World Cup, and for me that was the hardest thing that could happen to me in my life. I’ve dreamed of being able to play in a World Cup since I was 10 years old, and I chose <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because I thought it would be the best club to later be able to play in the World Cup. Now, signing for Atletico has been the best thing that could happen to me in my life.<br /><br />I had a very bad time in London. In the end I was training alone. I talked to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and he told me some things that I knew were not going to be as he had said. I was very nervous. My wife was in shock with me. I already knew that I could sign for Atletico if everything went well, and they had four games previously <b>[before Morata officially signed for them on January 29]</b>. I saw them all at home with my wife and she was amazed! She does not like football very much, and she did not understand how I could get like this, so crazy, watching Atletico games, screeching at home, nervous, when I was not an Atletico player yet. It’s a story I’d like to tell very slowly in the future. I went from being tied on the same amount of goals as <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at the start of the first year, and people made a song about me, I could not even go out in London! And one day I get up with a shooting pain in my back, my level goes down, and they start telling me everything <b>[referring to criticism about him]</b> in England. You are supposed to be respected by fans, but you know….<br /><br />I think in the end it was destiny <b>[moving back to Atletico]</b>. I left Atletico, and every so often I had the opportunity to return, although not so often when I was younger. When you have a bad time in a place, you don’t have that chance often <b>[to return]</b>. It motivated me a lot that <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> called me, no matter the club I was at, and told me that I could be important in Atletico. The people have welcomed me warmly here, even in the difficult situation that it was. The squad and the club staff have changed my life. As I arrive at the training centre, you can see in people’s faces when they trust you. When you are in the dressing room ahead a game, you see how your team-mates look at you.<br /><br />At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> there came a time when my team-mates, except for the Spaniards, well… you know, it is not the same when you play and you know that you give a pass to someone who is not going to do as well. You do not give the pass in the same way. Everyone who has played football once will understand that. And in the end, it is a situation that you cannot control: it is neither about being positive or negative, or about trying to have fun or being worried. It’s the confidence that others have in you: your team-mates, the club… And I found it here at Atletico.<br /><br />I have said it many times: there is a moment in which there are things that surpass fame, money and everything. Thank God, at Atletico I’ve been able to have a bit of all of this, but I would love to be here every year that I’m able to play at the highest level. I want to stay at Atletico but, contractually, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can call me back. We will see what happens in the negotiations between them, but the two clubs already know what I want. I only ask, please, as I said to Atletico, do everything possible to do it as soon as possible. Because I just want to be here</p>

But he has made an incredible gesture. I thank him and he knows what I think of him.<br /><br />It’s time to take a step forward in Atleti and in the national team.
