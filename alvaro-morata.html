  <p><b>[Spain forward Alvaro Morata says he is ready to fight for a starting spot in his second spell with Real Madrid]</b> In the two years at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I learned so much about what I should not do when I was in Madrid: get onto the pitch anxious to try to prove everything in a few minutes. Since that first experience in Madrid, I have grown so much. <b>[Fernando]</b> <a href="fernando-morientes.html">Morientes</a>, who was my idol, he told me that I had to leave and then return. I listened to him and I did well. It is clear that if I had gone to another team, I would have played more, but Real is my dream and I want to try to make it happen</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata reveals the secret behind his strong heading ability]</b> When I was seven or eight, I got a trampoline. My dad used to say to me all the time, ‘come on with the head’ and then pass the ball to me as I jumped. I really think it’s helped my heading game because I practiced this all the time with my dad. I found it funny when I was little to jump high and head or kick the ball, but it helped me for the future as well because the aerial game is one of my good points</p>

We will see what happens in the negotiations between them, but the two clubs already know what I want. I only ask, please, as I said to Atletico, do everything possible to do it as soon as possible. Because I just want to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have agreed terms with Atletico Madrid regarding the permanent sale of Alvaro Morata to the La Liga giants]</b> Atletico Madrid and Chelsea have reached an agreement over the transfer of Alvaro Morata from July 1, 2020. The Spanish striker will play at our club on loan this season, as was agreed when he joined Atletico Madrid in the January transfer window, and the move will become permanent at the beginning of the 2020-21 season. Morata made his debut at our club on February 3 against Betis. Since then, the Spaniard has played 17 games and scored six goals</p>

It would mean so much to me to win titles with Atleti, even more than anything I’ve won in the past because this is different.<br /><br /><b>[Morata netted six goals in 17 appearances across all competitions during the second half of the season for Diego Simeone’s side]</b> Big players have left, especially big characters. I wish they could still be here, but everyone has their own circumstances and has their own trajectory. <b>[Griezmann]</b> is a top top player, I don’t need to tell you how big he is. He’s been one of the best players that Atleti have had in recent times</p>

I’m as disappointed as everyone else is in the locker room. We had chances and we did not take advantage of them. For us, two points escaped us, but we also have to see the rest of the teams and what they will do on a trip as difficult as this one</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has confessed that his confidence hit an all-time low while he was at Chelsea]</b> I had stopped enjoying it. Now I’m happy, there were times I didn’t even believe in myself. ‘In some games in England I felt like when my teammates saw me unmarked, I knew they thought I wouldn’t do anything good with the ball. I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing. The only thing I had in mind was going to the World Cup, playing and being happy, and in the end, I was quite the opposite of happy<br /><br /><b>[The Spaniard went on to reveal why he felt he had no choice but to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> once he received an offer from Atletico]</b> If only I’d been able to mature before 20-22 years old, but I’d never faced such a limiting situation. I told my wife that we were going to go as far away as possible in January because I couldn’t deal with this pressure. Atletico came up, I had six or seven big offers and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> wanted me to stay, but I decided to do what I’d been looking to do for various summers</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata is finally fulfilling his potential alongside <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to banish the nightmare of his time at Chelsea]</b> I’ve played 15 official minutes, missed a penalty and they’re already killing me! So, I know what to expect<br /><br />I had lost confidence in myself previously. I was very upset by the opinion of the people in England. I think they caught me in the middle of everything. I didn’t quite feel loved or appreciated by the club or the fans. I started very well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but an injury, in the end, leaves you a bit stuck. As bad as it was, I still scored 15 goals and won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup… but I was out of the World Cup, and for me, that was the hardest thing that could happen to me in my life.<br /><br />I’ve dreamed of being able to play in a World Cup since I was 10 years old, and I chose <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because I thought it would be the best club to later be able to play in the World Cup. Now, signing for Atletico has been the best thing that could happen to me in my life. I had a very bad time in London. In the end, I was training alone. I talked to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and he told me some things that I knew were not going to be as he had said. I was very nervous. My wife was in shock.<br /><br />At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, there came a time when my team-mates, except for the Spaniards, well… you know, it is not the same when you play and you know that you give a pass to someone who is not going to do as well. You do not give the pass in the same way. Everyone who has played football once will understand that. And, in the end, it is a situation that you cannot control: it is neither about being positive or negative or about trying to have fun or being worried. It’s the confidence that others have in you: your team-mates, the club… And I found it here at Atletico. I have said it many times: there is a moment in which there are things that surpass fame, money and everything. Thank God, I’ve been able to have a bit of all of this at Atletico, but I would love to be here every year so that I’m able to play at my highest level</p>

Then I went through a period where I didn’t enjoy it so much. You know, it’s the path a young kid goes down to be a professional. You start with agents, sponsors. I felt a lot of pressure, I wasn’t starting games.<br /><br />I thought about leaving. Then I spent a year at Getafe and, you know what, it was an amazing year.
