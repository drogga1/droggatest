  <p><b>[Tom Glover has sealed a loan move to top-flight Swedish side Helsingborg]</b> Everything happened very quickly. I was away with the national team and when I landed in London, I got a call that Helsingborg was interested. I saw the match on Sunday and told my girlfriend and family that the fans looked amazing</p>

  <p><b>[From Sutherland to Spurs: Glover reflects on remarkable rise after <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> exit]</b> It was more than I expected. It has exceeded the limits I thought I would get to. They’ve just played in a Champions League final and are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I have to be realistic with myself, it would’ve been great to continue at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but I have got to put myself in a first-team environment.</p>

  <p><b>[Tom Glover’s father David Glover revealed goalkeeping was never on his son’s radar in the initial stages of his footballing career]</b> At the age of five and six they would take turns in goal and Tom refused. He would sit down in protest and only wanted to be an outfield player. It was very embarrassing for his parents! Only at 10 did he decide to have a crack at goalkeeping<br /><br />When he was in Year 7 at Aquinas <b>[Catholic College]</b> he wanted to try out for the senior soccer team amongst a bunch of 18-year-olds, but the school said he was too young. He hated going down and training with the kids his own age <b>[at local club Sutherland Sharks]</b>. Tom loved to be up training with the older boys</p>
