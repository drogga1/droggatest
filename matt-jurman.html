  <p><b>[Socceroos defender Matt Jurman has dismissed criticism over the team’s tactical set up]</b> The squad has complete trust in Ange. There’s always going to be critics about tactics or team selection. Ange has a big belief in changing the way the Socceroos style is looked at and to try to make the team able to go toe-to-toe with the best in the world. Everyone has bought into that and I think it is important to buy into his philosophy.<br /><br />To be able to represent my country at senior level was a dream and had been a goal of mine ever since I started playing football. I didn’t expect a month ago I would be playing in the two biggest games of the qualification but I enjoyed every minute and tried my best to help the team when I was needed. I think it <b>[a move to Korea]</b> has helped me a lot. The K-League is a very tough league to play in week in, week out. Playing in a back three in Suwon has helped me learn a different system</p>

  <p><b>[Wanderers sign Matt Jurman]</b> I spoke with Markus (Babbel) many times and those conversations showed that he wanted me at the club, how I fit into his plans and how he wants me to play. I want to win and I’m hoping that the team that Markus has put together this season is one that can do well and get to the top. The past three years overseas has made me a lot stronger, not having familiar surroundings makes you mentally stronger and I’ve had some great experiences and come back a better player. Having a support base around me again is going to be exciting - I have a lot of family and friends in Western Sydney so it is exciting to be back and to play in front of them for the Wanderers.</p>
