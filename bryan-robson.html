Celtic and Rangers dominated everything in Scotland but he took a young team, won a European trophy and then also won the league. For a club like Aberdeen, that is an incredible achievement. He then came down to United, built five different teams, brought the youth system back and has gone on to do an incredible job. To win as many trophies as he did is unheard of</p>

It depends on City with how they replace Kompany because he’ll be a big miss for them, he was a real leader in the dressing room. It also depends how you start the season, if you start it off really well you can be confident.

OK, you might want some advice on what you might sign for and when you do move but you are your own person, you can show the path you want to do in your own career. I don’t think many players do that. They are always taking advice from agents. Obviously agents want players to move on because they make money.

When Ole put on the players in the second-half all of a sudden it seemed to have freshened up, we played at a far better tempo and for me Paul Pogba was the case for that. He never gave the ball away, he dominated the game and he played the forwards into the game and they responded. Paul’s a great player and that’s the type of player we want at this football club. For me, Paul showed in the game against Perth that he cares, he wants to be a really top class player and he proved that by the way he performed<br /><br /><b>[With Pogba seemingly caught in the middle of a transfer tug of war, Robson has urged him to dictate his own future]</b> Players are influenced far too much by their agents instead of making their own decisions.

One thing fans should realise is sometimes agents get involved and say things that don’t come from the player. Players should concentrate on their own careers and make their own decisions rather than rely on agents. It’s your career - you do what you think is right. He’s a great player.

I’m really confident they can do better this year with the squad we’ve got. I was a manager and you know you can always improve. Add one or two players to the squad and we could be up there challenging this season. I’m really positive and confident. I would like to see one or two new signings and then we can compete with the best</p>

  <p><b>[Bryan Robson has laid down a challenge for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> squad to get a run of good results started against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> on Saturday]</b> We have got to step it up against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and put on a really good performance and get good results that will get everyone buzzing again. Yeah, they’ve had a good start to the season and have good young players. That’s why it’s important we have a good result against them. I think they will up there challenging for the top six and they will want to get back into Europe. It’s a tough game as they have some good players but that’s the challenge for us. If we want to be in the top four, we need to be beating teams like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> at home<br /><br /><b>[Robson thinks a good run of form over that short span would be enough to get the season back on track]</b> The boys have just got to get the <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> game out of their system, you know. We didn’t perform brilliantly on the day and we could have done better. Maybe if we’d scored the penalty (by <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> against Palace), but we got beat and that’s in the past. Ole thinks we are improving all the time, which I agree with, as I think we’ve played pretty well in the games I’ve seen. The atmosphere around the place is really good. All we’ve got to do is put a good set of results together, over a short period of time, so let’s get the season firing</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he expects United to be patient]</b> Yes, I do, because everyone went with the policy that they want to encourage the young boys coming through the ranks. That’s exactly what United have done. I think they’ve maybe allowed too many good, experienced players to leave the club without replacing them. That’s why it’s left them a little bit short<br /><br />I think <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>]</b> has still got a little bit of knowledge to know about being a centre-forward. I think it’s a natural game for him coming off the left side, but the right side as well. But I think through the middle of the park, I think Marcus needs to know that game a little bit better, where it’s not always about running through, it’s about build-up play and bringing midfield players into the game. That’s where Marcus can maybe improve his game a little bit.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> legend Bryan Robson claims to see shades of <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> in <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>]</b> I think it’s been a terrific impact and the first signs are he looks like a top player. He is always on the move, always wanting the ball, has got a great touch and makes double movements, a bit like Scholesy used to do. It’s where you go one way and come back and you’ve got a couple of yards of space, so he can get on the ball in that way. His energy levels and pace looks really good and he has showed he can hit a pass and score goals. So the initial period where he’s been at the club looks great. Great signs. I’ve already seen him around the training camp and he gets on really well with the boys, seeing as he’s only been here a couple of months. What I do like to see when he’s on the pitch is, even though he’s a forward-minded player, he’s already swivelling and looking on his shoulder, demanding of his team-mates<br /><br />I think it helps that he was captain at Sporting. I just think it’s something that is naturally in you. Bruno looks as though he has got that natural leadership quality, where he demands from his team-mates and that’s good. I can see it in <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>, since he was made captain, it’s coming out in him and he’s organising the people around him. I think <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a> is another one who is improving on that side and they’re organising the people around them. For Bruno, being an attack-minded player, to be doing that is a great attribute for the team as well as the ability he has got</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain Bryan Robson likened star midfielder <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> to club great Paul Scholes]</b> Since he came in he has looked a special player. He has a fantastic attitude. I have met him a few times, I have seen him at the training ground, he mixes really well with the lads, you can see why he was captain of Sporting <b>[Lisbon]</b> and what a talent he is. He is not like a <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a> or a Nicky Butt-type of player, for me, he is more like a Paul Scholes; he is brilliant at getting into little pockets in between the defence and the midfield, he gets into these areas and gets himself space<br /><br />But he has also got terrific vision where he sees a pass but he can also perform a pass like <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> could, and he can score a goal. Hopefully he proves me right and he goes on to be another <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> for Manchester United</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">The Red Devils</a> legend thinks <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> made a good decision by handing the England defender leadership duties earlier this season]</b> I thought it was deserved. Harry had done really well in the World Cup with England. He did really well with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>, so when you sign a player like him in a central position, a defender or a midfield player, I think that’s where the captaincy should come from.<br /><br />You’ve got to be a demanding figure for your team-mates, an organiser, and I think Harry portrayed that as soon as he came into the club. He wasn’t overawed about playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> which was another good thing. So I think Ole’s made the right decision by giving Harry the captaincy.<br /><br />Since then, off the pitch, he’s had an influence on the boys as well, about how you should be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player and doing the commercial stuff as well as looking after yourself off the pitch. I think he’s a top player, he’s got the right attitude to be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain and it’s a good decision by Ole.</p>
