He can score goals and create goals. When you put all that package into one, he’s exactly the type that we would like here. Remember he has played at a club like Arsenal, where you’ve got to be able to handle pressure. I think he’s 100 per cent guaranteed.<br /><br />All of the top six teams have the same problem to a degree. You only have so many top-class players who are available and will move on. Even then you have to compete with the likes of Real Madrid , Barcelona and Bayern Munich.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is not really appreciated]</b> The media are always trying to criticise Paul. To a certain degree, that’s because of the transfer fee and not because of the player. But when I look at Pogba, he has come into the club and improved us in that area. He has got certain things our other midfield players haven’t got.<br /><br />Paul is not really appreciated by certain sections of the media but when he’s not in the team, I think he’s missed. With the confidence of winning three trophies, I think he will go on and have an even better campaign next season<br /><br /><b>[Robson has also hailed the decision to hand Pogba’s midfield colleague Michael Carrick a new contract]</b> I’m absolutely delighted as Michael has got great experience. He is good for the dressing room and knows what the club is all about. He is a really sensible lad who trains really hard and some of that can rub off on the kids coming through at this moment in time. I’m delighted to see he’s been given another year</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United need to bring in flair players during the summer transfer window]</b> It certainly was a great ending in Stockholm. It finished off an okay season and made it into a very good season. To win the Community Shield, EFL Cup and then the Europa League, to go into the Champions League, has set everyone up great for next season.<br /><br />When you look at the way Jose has turned club around, I know we won the FA Cup the year before, but he came in and brought in four new players who I think improved the team and improved the squad. So that went very well and then we got into a way of playing. Okay, we drew a lot of games at home but we weren’t getting beaten.<br /><br />We are a difficult team to beat now and what you can do, if you set your stall out that way to be difficult to beat, is to then add a few flair players to that squad. All of a sudden, you’re winning a lot more games than you’re drawing. So I can see us up there challenging for the title next season</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s bright start to the new season has seen Bryan Robson bill Jose Mourinho’s side as the club’s best since Sir Alex Ferguson left]</b> It always depends on injuries throughout the year, but as far as I am concerned since Sir Alex left this is probably the strongest squad that I’ve seen. We’ve got pace, we’ve got power, but we’ve also got quality players. That helps to try and win titles, but Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham - these sort of teams are top-class teams. You’ve got to compete against them and do well against them, but I am quite confident that the boys can do that this year and we can compete against the best.<br /><br />I think Paul had a real good season last season. I disagree with people who were a little bit critical of him. People can go on about the transfer fee but I thought Paul did really well and that’s why we won the two major trophies last year - part of that was because he performed really well in the big games. I thought he played really well in the final against Southampton and then he had a big influence, scoring the first goal in the Europa League final, so I think Paul did better than what people give him credit for last season. And I think he is only going to get better.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s struggle to produce their early-season spark is down to the ongoing absence of Paul Pogba]</b> The only thing which is a little bit of a shame for United so far, because I think United might have had even more points on the board, is if Pogba had been fit all the time. Because I thought the balance of Matic and Pogba, Herrera or Fellaini, whichever way the manager wanted to play them: Pogba was scoring goals, but he was creating goals because he had this really good understanding with Lukaku. So I think we’ve missed that to a certain degree and that’s why we’re not scoring as many goals as when we started the season. The sooner Pogba comes back the better for the club.<br /><br />If United can dominate the midfield area where we don’t let <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard get a lot of the ball and Pedro, then I think our centre halves can handle <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata. If we can dominate the midfield area then we’ve got a great chance of getting a result. I’m going to go for a draw. Yeah, I think there could be a few goals, but I think it’ll be a tied game</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are no longer going backwards under Jose Mourinho]</b> I think we keep improving as a football team and, as a football club, we’re getting back to where we should be. You’ve got to say not last season but the season before we won the FA Cup, which was great to do but the performances weren’t great and, for me, we were going backwards. For me, since Jose’s been in, we’ve started improving. We won three trophies last year and let’s see what we can win this year.<br /><br />I don’t know what it is with the players at the moment because they did it against Arsenal - get off to a great start and then go on the back-foot and try and play a bit defensive rather than go for the killer goal. But like against West Brom at the weekend <b>[in a 2-1 win]</b>, West Brom score and then all of a sudden it becomes a nervous last 10 minutes. So the lads have got to get that out of their system. You’ve got to keep pressing and doing the right things which gets you that lead in the first place. I’m sure the manager’s talking to the players about that and going for the jugular and making sure you win the game and are not hanging on</p>

He likes to be in that limelight, coming across that he’s a laid back character and he’s jovial and he wants a bit of banter with the fans. For me though, it’s a little bit too much. You need to win. It’s not a game, so that’s where somebody like myself, Roy Keane and Graeme Souness, those sorts of people, a Gary Neville when he’s commentating, we understood that. This isn’t a game, this is our living and we need to win and I think Paul’s got to get that a bit more into his character. This is a job</p>

The minority of fans in clubs will be asking for the manager’s head after a few bad results and it’s often they speak the loudest. The track record that Jose has holds up. After three games, you don’t talk about sacking the manager, you encourage and back him.<br /><br />What I’d like to see is Jose picking two centre halves he trusts and see them for a run of games. We need two defenders who know each other properly. Like Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and others but the centre halves have also always been in the team. It would be nice to see that for a run of games and get clean sheets</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Bryan Robson feels that Paul Pogba fields unjust levels of criticism when the Old Trafford club are misfiring]</b> There is a little bit of unfair criticism for me about Paul. Every time Manchester United don’t play well and get a poor result, it always seems to be Paul who gets most of the criticism. If I just look at one game this season when we were really poor, our worst game of the season - against Brighton - there were a lot of other players who have to take responsibility. Not just Paul<br /><br />Within a football club you’ve all got to get on well together. You don’t have to be friends but, after getting off to a slow start, that’s the time when you all pull together. You’ve got to have belief in your team-mates and in yourself. You’ve got to start raising your own game. It’s not all about having a go at people, it’s about encouraging your team-mates as well. That’s really important for me in football that, as team-mates, you’ve got a responsibility in the dressing room to have a go at each other if you think somebody is being lazy or slacking in training. If somebody’s been brilliant, you praise them. You try to then get more out of them</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez remains a top-class player in the eyes of Manchester United legend Bryan Robson]</b> Sanchez is a top-class player. But we haven’t seen the best of him at Manchester United so far. But I’m sure he’ll get to the top of his game. This summer was the first summer he’s had off for several years, and that should do him good. Sometimes, though, when you have a free summer and a fair few weeks off, it can take a little bit more time to come back really sharp and to get into the season. These first few games of the season are maybe just what he needs to sharpen him up and then hopefully we’ll see the best of him for the rest of the season<br /><br />I think the main thing for Lukaku is to keep getting into those goal-scoring positions. You go through periods where you will score a lot of goals and a striker will go through a barren patch where he doesn’t score for a few games. But with Rom, he just needs to keep getting into those positions that he managed at the weekend and he will get goals. The one thing that’s guaranteed, as long as he stays free of injury - he will get up to the 30-goal mark for United again this season. It’s also a matter of Sanchez, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard, <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial and <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford all getting into double figures this season in terms of goals, if we’re really going to challenge for the title. Lingard did well in terms of goals last season, getting into double figures, and it can’t all fall on Lukaku. There are going to be periods in the season when he goes through that barren spell and doesn’t score. When that happens, there have to be other people there who can score goals for United if we’re going to be challenging for trophies</p>

I think Sanchez can get up there with them. For me, he is a top player. He has a winning mentality, works hard for the team and has great ability.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s decision to leave Real Madrid for Juventus over the summer stunned Bryan Robson]</b> I was surprised that Ronaldo didn’t finish his career at Real Madrid or Manchester United. That was a surprising move when he went to Juventus. Someone like Ronaldo can change your season. It can happen<br /><br />The defining moments for our lads will be how well we do against the bigger clubs who are going to be challenging for the Champions League spots and the title. If United have a really good season against that opposition, anything can happen. People are saying it’s similar with 92-93 when we had a slow start but went on to win the title. I think this squad definitely can challenge and be up there. It was a little bit disappointing a start. Everyone understands that. But there have been a few performances, Antonio Valencia coming back into the team, Nemanja Matic, some of the World Cup players looking that bit sharper in the Burnley game. You can see the balance and shape of the team coming together</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has been challenged to become a 20 or 30-goal-a-season striker]</b> I think you always want to improve and better yourself. Marcus is in a great position - he’s been in the first-team squad for over three years now. You can see him maturing, he’s building his stamina and strength, and he’s looking really good and sharp at the moment. He’s going in the right direction. The only thing I would like to see is his finishing just being that little bit better.<br /><br />He’s adapted really well, because he has been playing wide as a player for quite some time now - he hasn’t had too many chances through the middle as a centre-forward. But I think it educates you as a player and Marcus is definitely going the right way to be a top-class player for Manchester United over the years ahead<br /><br />Everything that Marcus has done has been very good so far, but it’s always the same with young lads - at the age of 21, you’re still a young lad - it’s about improving and getting better and better</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have to match the spending of City]</b> Manchester United have to really improve their recruitment. Though the gap between them and Manchester City seems large, I still believe two or three excellent additions will make them competitive. During my time in management it was always proved that if you buy average players you end up with an average team. The club can still attract players but they will have to match the spending of City to give Jose Mourinho a better chance. They should allow him to identify who he wants and then go out and get them. Then it’s up to Jose to deliver a title-chasing squad and I still believe he is the man who can take them forward.<br /><br />The World Cup took its toll on United’s start to the campaign but there have been signs of recovery up until Sunday <b>[against City]</b>. Now it’s a case of recharging and going again. United fans shouldn’t be too despondent. It’s a long, hard season and there’s plenty of twists to come. A league title was never realistic but, with a couple of additions, it is realistic to think they can make the top four and Champions League, then look to step up next season. City have set a high standard but it’s not insurmountable<br /><br />There are mitigating circumstances for United’s performance against City on Sunday. The squad didn’t get back from Turin until 3.30am on Thursday <b>[following a Champions League clash with Juventus]</b> and that saps your energy ahead of a derby game - plus they were without Paul Pogba. He has plenty of critics but I’m not one of them. He’s a big-game player and the team sorely missed his dynamism across the park</p>

I don’t think it’s any coincidence that since Ander got back in the team, everybody has been talking about <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial and Marcus Rashford and Pogba, but I think Herrera has played really well since he came into the team. Because he’s playing week in, week out, he’s a lot sharper than when he was coming into the team for maybe one game and then he was on the bench. I think playing regularly has brought the best out of Ande.<br /><br /><b>[on Herrera’s qualities]</b> He’s a worker. He works so hard for the team. He knows the position of a central midfield player. He protects the back four and he doesn’t give the ball away very often. He’s a decent passer of the ball but he allows people like Pogba and the attacking midfield players to get on with the game. The good thing about Ander as well is that he can actually score you a goal if he’s in the team all the time<br /><br />I do <b>[think he’s underrated]</b>.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is not a suitable candidate to succeed Antonio Valencia as Manchester United captain]</b> In the current squad, because of the way they try to organise, they communicate with team-mates, I think we only have two who are quite good at that. So, we have Chris Smalling, who tries to organise, he shouts at people, he organises people. And then Ander Herrera. I’ve watched him in training, he’s an organiser. And that’s what you need from your captain. I mean, sometimes you can go with ‘Paul Pogba could be a captain’, but Paul would just be the best player. So, he’s the best player, so, you give him the captaincy because he’s the best player. But Paul plays more of an individual sort of side. He’s not really saying to people ‘you come here, you come here, push forward’, or just applaud your team-mate. When they give the ball away, you encourage them. You don’t always tell everybody off. Sometimes you have to encourage your team-mates, you can’t just be telling people off all the time … I think Herrera and Smalling are two captains</p>

It depends on City with how they replace Kompany because he’ll be a big miss for them, he was a real leader in the dressing room.

OK, you might want some advice on what you might sign for and when you do move but you are your own person, you can show the path you want to do in your own career. I don’t think many players do that. They are always taking advice from agents. Obviously agents want players to move on because they make money.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> icon Bryan Robson has praised <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>’s performance in their 2-0 pre-season win over Perth Glory on Saturday]</b> No wonder <b>[the fans]</b> are going ‘please stay’ because the first-half was sort of like the first game of the season…a little bit stop start. When Ole put on the players in the second-half all of a sudden it seemed to have freshened up, we played at a far better tempo and for me <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> was the case for that. He never gave the ball away, he dominated the game and he played the forwards into the game and they responded. Paul’s a great player and that’s the type of player we want at this football club. For me, Paul showed in the game against Perth that he cares, he wants to be a really top class player and he proved that by the way he performed<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> seemingly caught in the middle of a transfer tug of war, Robson has urged him to dictate his own future]</b> Players are influenced far too much by their agents instead of making their own decisions.

  <p><b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> continues to generate exit talk at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but Red Devils legend Bryan Robson says he would have the Frenchman in his side ‘all the time’]</b> He’d be in my team all the time. One thing fans should realise is sometimes agents get involved and say things that don’t come from the player. Players should concentrate on their own careers and make their own decisions rather than rely on agents. It’s your career - you do what you think is right. He’s a great player. He should concentrate on that. He’s contracted to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and he should concentrate on playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />With the squad and the players we’ve got we must do better than last season. We’ve bought two new players, young lads with great potential. When I was at the Player of the Year awards you could see the disappointment of the lads. I’m really confident they can do better this year with the squad we’ve got. I was a manager and you know you can always improve. Add one or two players to the squad and we could be up there challenging this season. I’m really positive and confident. I would like to see one or two new signings and then we can compete with the best</p>

  <p><b>[Bryan Robson has laid down a challenge for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> squad to get a run of good results started against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> on Saturday]</b> We have got to step it up against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and put on a really good performance and get good results that will get everyone buzzing again. Yeah, they’ve had a good start to the season and have good young players. That’s why it’s important we have a good result against them. I think they will up there challenging for the top six and they will want to get back into Europe. It’s a tough game as they have some good players but that’s the challenge for us. If we want to be in the top four, we need to be beating teams like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> at home<br /><br /><b>[Robson thinks a good run of form over that short span would be enough to get the season back on track]</b> The boys have just got to get the <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> game out of their system, you know. We didn’t perform brilliantly on the day and we could have done better. Maybe if we’d scored the penalty (by <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> against Palace), but we got beat and that’s in the past. Ole thinks we are improving all the time, which I agree with, as I think we’ve played pretty well in the games I’ve seen. The atmosphere around the place is really good. All we’ve got to do is put a good set of results together, over a short period of time, so let’s get the season firing</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he expects United to be patient]</b> Yes, I do, because everyone went with the policy that they want to encourage the young boys coming through the ranks. That’s exactly what United have done. I think they’ve maybe allowed too many good, experienced players to leave the club without replacing them. That’s why it’s left them a little bit short<br /><br />I think <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>]</b> has still got a little bit of knowledge to know about being a centre-forward. I think it’s a natural game for him coming off the left side, but the right side as well. But I think through the middle of the park, I think Marcus needs to know that game a little bit better, where it’s not always about running through, it’s about build-up play and bringing midfield players into the game. That’s where Marcus can maybe improve his game a little bit.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> legend Bryan Robson claims to see shades of <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> in <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>]</b> I think it’s been a terrific impact and the first signs are he looks like a top player. He is always on the move, always wanting the ball, has got a great touch and makes double movements, a bit like Scholesy used to do. It’s where you go one way and come back and you’ve got a couple of yards of space, so he can get on the ball in that way. His energy levels and pace looks really good and he has showed he can hit a pass and score goals. So the initial period where he’s been at the club looks great. Great signs. I’ve already seen him around the training camp and he gets on really well with the boys, seeing as he’s only been here a couple of months. What I do like to see when he’s on the pitch is, even though he’s a forward-minded player, he’s already swivelling and looking on his shoulder, demanding of his team-mates<br /><br />I think it helps that he was captain at Sporting. I just think it’s something that is naturally in you. Bruno looks as though he has got that natural leadership quality, where he demands from his team-mates and that’s good. I can see it in <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>, since he was made captain, it’s coming out in him and he’s organising the people around him. I think <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a> is another one who is improving on that side and they’re organising the people around them. For Bruno, being an attack-minded player, to be doing that is a great attribute for the team as well as the ability he has got</p>

He has a fantastic attitude. I have met him a few times, I have seen him at the training ground, he mixes really well with the lads, you can see why he was captain of Sporting <b>[Lisbon]</b> and what a talent he is. He is not like a <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a> or a Nicky Butt-type of player, for me, he is more like a Paul Scholes; he is brilliant at getting into little pockets in between the defence and the midfield, he gets into these areas and gets himself space<br /><br />But he has also got terrific vision where he sees a pass but he can also perform a pass like <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> could, and he can score a goal. Hopefully he proves me right and he goes on to be another <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> for Manchester United</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">The Red Devils</a> legend thinks <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> made a good decision by handing the England defender leadership duties earlier this season]</b> I thought it was deserved. Harry had done really well in the World Cup with England. He did really well with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>, so when you sign a player like him in a central position, a defender or a midfield player, I think that’s where the captaincy should come from.<br /><br />You’ve got to be a demanding figure for your team-mates, an organiser, and I think Harry portrayed that as soon as he came into the club. He wasn’t overawed about playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> which was another good thing. So I think Ole’s made the right decision by giving Harry the captaincy.<br /><br />Since then, off the pitch, he’s had an influence on the boys as well, about how you should be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player and doing the commercial stuff as well as looking after yourself off the pitch. I think he’s a top player, he’s got the right attitude to be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain and it’s a good decision by Ole.</p>
