  <p><b>[Allie Long of USA gives an insight into what life is like for a woman in the men’s New York futsal leagues]</b> Sometimes I’d get the ball and they’d back up two yards and I would tell them, ‘No, it’s OK you can play me like a guy, I don’t care’. I remember one guy elbowed me in the face and said, ‘Go play with dolls!’ It was that intense. I just laughed</p>

  <p><b>[Allie Long sang Megan Rapinoe’s praises after the United States won the Women’s World Cup, beating the Netherlands 2-0]</b> She deserves every ounce of this stardom that she is getting. She is special. She is an amazing team-mate, an amazing person, and I’m truly honored to share the field with her. I just love her so much. She’s one of the bravest people that I know and someone that stands up for people that don’t have a voice. That’s so much harder than people realize to do. I just love her.<br /><br /><b>[Describing the feeling of being a world champion for the first time, she was ecstatic]</b> I feel absolute gratitude. There’s so many close relationships on this team and I’ve never felt more unified and just grateful to be a part of such a special team. It’s my ultimate dream to win the World Cup. I’ve dreamt of this day since <b>[the USA won it in]</b> 1999 and so for it to be my dream as a reality, it’s just remarkable</p>

  <p><b>[Allie Long has conceded that the U.S. women’s national team probably will not accept a potential invite to the White House after winning the World Cup]</b> We’ll see if we are invited after <b>[Rapinoe’s]</b> comment. Whatever we do, we’ll do it together and probably not <b>[go to the White House]</b> I’d assume<br /><br /><b>[When asked if Rapinoe would make that call]</b> I think that Megan … Yes. She already said that she will not be going there so we stand behind her. We stand unified together. If that’s what our team decides then that’s what we’ll decide, but we need the invite first. I don’t know if we’re invited yet<br /><br /><b>[The issue of equal pay in football has also been a main subject of discussion in the wake of yet another trophy success for the USWNT]</b> I feel like we know that winning this we set the precedent for equal pay in the United States and hopefully around the world. I encourage women all over to believe that they are equal and that they deserve equal pay and I hope that we can unify every national team. I don’t care - from the bottom to the top, it doesn’t matter. Everyone deserves their share<br /><br /><b>[Long also revealed that the USWNT was channelling the spirit of the famous 1999 team which won the country’s second World Cup in California]</b> Going into this World Cup I knew that I could be one of the players that I looked up to in 1999. Watching them win and hold the championship, that’s a driving motivation behind all of us and it’s a responsibility. We welcome that and we love it and I hope that millions and millions of girls at home are watching, that they felt inspired and that it’s sparked something and planted seeds in their heart and that’s what they strive for when they grow up. It starts with a dream and then it’s up to you</p>

  <p><b>[Combine the two evenly so that each World Cup-winning side takes home $430m each - and watch the women’s sport blossom. And it’s not as if it’s impossible to pay men and women athletes equally. Since 2007, Wimbledon singles players - male and female - have been paid equally]</b> It’s about time that women do get paid more. I think that the USWNT has been fighting for that on the field and off the field for a couple of years, so we’re proud hearing that and just knowing that we have so much support behind us. We just hope that the rest of the women, every female in the stadium, every female watching back home, they know that one day there will be equal pay. I truly believe that</p>
