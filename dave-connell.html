<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tyler Toland: Ireland’s youngest ever player making waves at Man City]</b> She was head and shoulders above anyone else in <b>[her]</b> league. She held her own then against the most competitive leagues. I just think it was just her dynamic around the park <b>[that made her stand out]</b>. <b>[She was]</b> quite fit, even as a young girl, and was able to get around the pitch and just keep things simple. She won the ball and did it simple - and did it very well<br /><br />What we always wanted from Tyler was to do what she did well, and in some cases did very well, and that was just winning the ball and doing things simple. You would never regard her as a No.10 or your most creative player, but it’s something that we’re challenging her to do. Early doors, a lot of her passing would’ve been backwards and square, so it’s trying to look forward and she’s certainly taken that on board in the last few years, and she’s adding that to her game all the time. She’s at a great club now and I’m sure they’ll develop her even more<br /><br />A lot of people will look at it and say she won’t play a lot, but you’re going into a club with top players and a top set-up. She’s going to get good habits there. They’ll demand a lot, challenge her lot, and they’re renowned for their younger players. It’s a great move for her, it was probably the final piece in a very early jigsaw at this stage</p>
