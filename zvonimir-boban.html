  <p><b>[Zvonimir Boban on Balotelli]</b> There’s way too much talking about <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. All he has achieved in his life is sitting on the bench at other clubs. He would have been carrying the bags of players such as <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>, George Weah and <a href="andriy-shevchenko.html">Andriy Shevchenko</a> in my days. He does not understand what it means to wear the Milan jersey. Milan will always be bigger than <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. His poor attitude is only further proof that he doesn’t understand the value of playing for Milan. People like <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a>, <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> and <a href="franco-baresi.html">Franco Baresi</a> would have slapped him for showing up late</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan chief football officer Zvonimir Boban believes goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma will remain with the Serie A giants]</b> <b>[Paolo]</b> Maldini said that we are happy to have probably the best goalkeeper in the world, surely the best talent in the world in that role. For the moment, he remains. He can change, but it is not said that he will leave<br /><br />He is one of the few coaches that makes you clearly understand how he wants to play, in every situation. Giampaolo will find the right path, with the players but also with the game</p>

  <p><b>[Zvonimir Boban has repeated Paolo Maldini’s statement that AC Milan will not be able to sign Luka Modric from Real Madrid]</b> Twenty days ago, Paolo Maldini declared that Luka Modric will not be a Milan player. But since we continue to talk about it and write about it without any basis, I would like to repeat that the best player in the world of last year will not be our player. As far as I can see, he will still be in Madrid. Obviously, it would be great to have him, but this is the only truth<br /><br /><b>[Images have previously circulated of a young Modric in Milan colours]</b> Luka is a person and a player of the highest level. We thank him for his good wishes for next season and we are pleased that he has liked our club since he was a child, but it is right to clarify things – out of respect for our fans, too</p>

  <p><b>[Zvonimir Boban is confident that <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a>, along with Suso and <a href="franck-kessie.html">Franck Kessie</a>, will not be leaving San Siro before the deadline]</b> We want to keep them, absolutely. I don’t want to compare the operations, let alone discuss the market of other clubs, but time and results will tell us who has worked well and who has not. In our opinion, we are doing our best considering the various problems, which are real. It will take time, but we will return to the top. We are all aware of this. The low profile <b>[of the signings]</b> should not be mistaken for low ambition. Did anyone know <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> when he arrived? We are doing our best considering the various challenges. I am convinced that in the end the fans will be happy with our choices. We are not looking for senseless fireworks, like a few years ago. We need to make the most logical footballing decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Zvonimir Boban says <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> remains on the books at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> because he didn’t want to leave after a bad season]</b> He is a big Milan fan, and has been ever since he was a child, so he had the passion to join us. However, we never got into concrete talks, he didn’t want to leave Real after a bad season<br /><br /><b>[While Milan were unable to prise <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> from Madrid, they did lure his countryman Ante Rebic away from Eintracht Frankfurt on a two-year loan]</b> He has so much character and strength. In addition, he knows how to play in different roles. He can be deployed on both flanks or elsewhere. We are happy that he is with us because he is a serious boy, who has grown technically in recent years<br /><br /><b>[Another target that slipped Milan’s net was Angel Correa, with no agreement reached with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> for the Argentine winger before the deadline passed]</b> For Correa, we didn’t find ourselves on the same economic basis, and that is okay. There were also other good players that we didn’t sign. We have a good squad, we made good signings and we will see over time how well we did<br /><br /><b>[Boban admits that he would like to see changes made to the summer transfer market]</b> It was a heavy window, I hope that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> will shorten the time. With the current dates, the teams and managers are stressed. Players come and go. Our strategy? Young players, but they have to be accompanied by experienced ones as well, perhaps it would be better to have a few more of those</p>

Yes, that’s the reality.<br /><br /><b>[Milan stumbled to a goalless draw against Sassuolo which added to the tensions as the ex-midfielder who lit up San Siro in the 90’s admitted]</b> The party would have been better with a win today but the players did as much as they could and we deserved to win. Today was a bit tense and I couldn’t enjoy my old friends and team-mates in the best of ways, but tonight it will be nice to party with everyone who has been a part of the history of this club. I have been privileged to be part of that history</p>

He joined the team with a very humble approach despite he is a player with a great strength under many aspects. He had a real impact on his young team-mates and his arrival was a huge boost to their confidence. It was not easy, but he just found the perfect way to understand the delicate moment our players were going through. We will be grateful to him for this forever because he had nothing to prove coming to Milan and everything to lose</p>

The fact we’re having to talk about this is not good for anyone. The worst part is that this destabilising event is happening during a moment when the team is improving and you can see <a href="stefano-pioli.html">Stefano Pioli</a>’s hard work. Not even warning us was disrespectful and inelegant. It was not the Milan style. At least not what we remembered the Milan style as being. The way I see it, unity means sharing, unity means respect. At the end of the day, we need that approach, it is the only way to work and feel good. We’ve already talked to <a href="ivan-gazidis.html">Gazidis</a>. For the good of Milan, it is certainly necessary that a meeting with the ownership happens as soon as possible.<br /><br />The owners must be clear both in terms of the budget and their objectives. In essence, we must respect the needs of the club to balance the books, while the owners must respect leaving the sporting results to those who represent the history and values of a great club. At this moment, despite the efforts we made in the January transfer window, making many cuts and sales to lower the wage bill, we still don’t know what margins we’ll be working with for the summer. We were asked to lower the average age of the squad and we did that, but always maintaining the need for the right mix between youth and experience. The January transfer window shows we were right, you can see how quickly the younger players improved with more senior figures by their side</p>
