  <dd>Following the revelation that Loris Karius suffered concussion in the Champions League final, FIFPro has declared complete solidarity with the Liverpool and vowed to provide greater awareness of potential health threats to professional players</dd>

  <p><b>[FIFPro identified 15 players that would fall into the category of not having taken enough holiday]</b> Players are coming under too much pressure, caught between the needs of their clubs and their own personal well-being. While FIFPro understands the financial implications of the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League for clubs, the health of these players is being put at risk because of such a congested match schedule</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[What is football’s concussion protocol?]</b> It’s important that FIFA takes a leadership role to enforce the world’s gold standard in concussion management. While team doctors have a critical role to play, it cannot be the case that they are left to make mistakes of this nature, putting the player at risk, without any consequences. FIFA has the responsibility … to intervene in order to ensure the players are protected</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s decision to increase the total prize money for the Women’s World Cup from $15m to $30m]</b> Despite these changes football remains even further from the goal of equality for all World Cup players regardless of gender. In reality, the changes actually signify an increase in the gap between men’s and women’s prize money. This regressive trend appears to contravene <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s statutory commitment to gender equality</p>

  <p><b>[FIFPRO backs <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> squad against ‘abuse and intimidation’ from club]</b> <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s intention to withhold player salaries is without valid grounds and is being contested collectively. FIFPRO believes that the ad-hoc decision of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> forbidding players to go home and re-join their families, following the match against RB Salzburg, was unjustified. Like every other employee, professional football players have the right to ensure that their private life is respected, especially considering the already congested fixture list which sees many players away from home for prolonged periods.<br /><br />The grounds on which <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> seeks the application of fines, for the players’ refusal to follow the unreasonable instructions of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, contradict provisions in Italy’s collective bargaining agreement. The players of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> cannot be subjected to arbitrary decisions of a disenchanted club when the result of a match is unsatisfactory.<br /><br />We echo the sentiments of FIFPRO member, Associazione Italiana Calciatori (AIC), in that <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and his technical staff are ultimately responsible for managing the playing group however they deem fit. Technical matters are not the responsibility of club directors and we support <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> and the players of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> for their united stand in clearly difficult times. FIFPRO is standing by ready to assist, in close co-operation with AIC, to ensure the players are not subjected to further abuse and intimidation</p>
