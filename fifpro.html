  <p><b>[Paul Pogba missed out on being in the FIFA FIFPro World 11 by just TWO votes, with Toni Kroos getting the nod in his place]</b> The closest call was the third midfield position, with Kroos narrowly beating Pogba by two votes. It is the smallest margin ever in the 12-year World 11 history to decide on inclusion in the World 11.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFPro backs FPAI’s stance on Indian Super League’s draft]</b> It is imperative that the players - the stars of the Indian Super League - are able to negotiate their own working conditions. The Indian Super League cannot impose conditions to fit with its business model without consulting players.<br /><br />Players are unhappy with a draft system because they could be moved on to a different club against their will and not have the right to negotiate their salary. The union also wants to discuss rules that restrict contracts to one year, impose quotas on the number of Indian players and fix a squad salary cap</p>

  <p><b>[Kenyan footballer Clifton Miheso reaches out to FIFA after alleging his contract was terminated at gunpoint]</b> Clifton Miheso’s lawyer has filed a complaint to Fifa after the footballer was pressured by two men carrying guns to terminate his contract with South African club Golden Arrows. The armed men arrived in the club’s offices where he was meeting with the chief executive and pressured him into signing a document rescinding his contract.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFPro, the footballers’ union, confirmed that it is perturbed by the frequency of fixtures at this time of year in England]</b> We have, of course, some concerns about the number of matches played in the festive period in the Premier League, which can have some negative consequences for the performances and health of our players. Congested fixture periods are associated with increased rates of injury, especially in the hamstrings. This scientific evidence shows that a short period of recovery between matches <b>[less than three days]</b> is associated with more matches lost. <b>[The]</b> injury rate is increased in league matches with less than four days compared with more than six days’ recovery. Playing two matches per week with a recovery time of 72-96 hours between these matches leads to a significant higher risk for injury by comparison to one match per week. Muscle injury rates during matches are lower when players are given at least six recovery days between matches.<br /><br />The in-season break is important to recover physically and mentally from the first half of the season <b>[eight to 10 days]</b></p>

  <p><b>[FIFPro identified 15 players that would fall into the category of not having taken enough holiday]</b> Players are coming under too much pressure, caught between the needs of their clubs and their own personal well-being. While FIFPro understands the financial implications of the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League for clubs, the health of these players is being put at risk because of such a congested match schedule</p>

  <p><b>[UEFA say Inter Milan failed to follow anti-racism protocol during Koulibaly incident]</b> FIFPro and UEFA are very concerned by this unacceptable racist incident and by what appears on the surface to be a failure to respect the widely-recognised three-step anti-racism protocol. Koulibaly, a French-Senegalese defender, was subject to racist chanting and, despite announcements made by the stadium speaker, the chants did not stop. Moreover, it seems that Napoli’s coaching staff had already informed the referee several times of racist chants. Both organisations are of the opinion that the racist chants towards Koulibaly, who had to leave the pitch after receiving a second yellow card, are unacceptable and have no place in football.<br /><br />Both organisations applaud the prompt actions taken by Italy’s football authorities, who sanctioned FC Internazionale with the next two matches to be played behind closed doors and, additionally, with a partial closure for FC Internazionale’s third home match</p>

  <p><b>[What is football’s concussion protocol?]</b> It’s important that FIFA takes a leadership role to enforce the world’s gold standard in concussion management. While team doctors have a critical role to play, it cannot be the case that they are left to make mistakes of this nature, putting the player at risk, without any consequences. FIFA has the responsibility … to intervene in order to ensure the players are protected</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s decision to increase the total prize money for the Women’s World Cup from $15m to $30m]</b> Despite these changes football remains even further from the goal of equality for all World Cup players regardless of gender. In reality, the changes actually signify an increase in the gap between men’s and women’s prize money. This regressive trend appears to contravene <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s statutory commitment to gender equality</p>

  <p><b>[FIFPRO backs <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> squad against ‘abuse and intimidation’ from club]</b> <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s intention to withhold player salaries is without valid grounds and is being contested collectively. FIFPRO believes that the ad-hoc decision of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> forbidding players to go home and re-join their families, following the match against RB Salzburg, was unjustified. Like every other employee, professional football players have the right to ensure that their private life is respected, especially considering the already congested fixture list which sees many players away from home for prolonged periods.<br /><br />The grounds on which <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> seeks the application of fines, for the players’ refusal to follow the unreasonable instructions of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, contradict provisions in Italy’s collective bargaining agreement. The players of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> cannot be subjected to arbitrary decisions of a disenchanted club when the result of a match is unsatisfactory.<br /><br />We echo the sentiments of FIFPRO member, Associazione Italiana Calciatori (AIC), in that <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and his technical staff are ultimately responsible for managing the playing group however they deem fit. Technical matters are not the responsibility of club directors and we support <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> and the players of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> for their united stand in clearly difficult times. FIFPRO is standing by ready to assist, in close co-operation with AIC, to ensure the players are not subjected to further abuse and intimidation</p>
