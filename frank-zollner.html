  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> physiotherapist Frank Zollner has admitted <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> can go pretty crazy sometimes]</b> He’s a special guy. There were so many days when you’d think: ‘Great guy!’, but sometimes you’d think: ‘What an egocentric!’. One time, <a href="jakub-blaszczykowski.html">Jakub Blaszczykowski</a> called me when he was coming back from the <b>[Polish]</b> national team. He said he couldn’t train because of a muscle injury but would still come to the team meeting. Before the meeting, I went to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> with Kuba (Blaszczykowski) and told him what was going on. He then went pretty crazy, probably because he had only just learned about Kuba’s injury at that moment. Zeljko Buvac (Klopp’s former assistant) would often appear at such moments and say: ‘Kloppo, smoke a cigarette now and calm down!’. He was one of the best assistant coaches I’ve ever worked under. But Kloppo had the balls to apologise when the way he treated someone was too much<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his exit from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>]</b> From about 2008 I finally realised that something had to change. Once I came home and met my crying daughter. Her boyfriend had apparently split up with her - and I didn’t even know she had one! <b>[It was also because of]</b> the episodes such as those mentioned under Kloppo, who would sometimes call spontaneous meetings in the evening so that the end of the working day was delayed and it was no longer possible to contact the family in advance to let them know. At some point the children hardly wanted to talk to me anymore. I said: ‘now it’s over’.<br /><br /><b>[Another hugely respected head coach Zollner worked under was <a href="ottmar-hitzfeld.html">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a>, with the physio explaining how he was lucky not to incur his wrath for helping a part-drunk, part-hungover Stefan Klos during a training camp]</b> It was 1995 and we were at a training camp on Lake Lucerne. It was always the case that the physio room was close to a fire escape and I usually had the key to it. Sometimes I just didn’t close the door and one night the boys went off to have a party. The next day I noticed right away that some of them were pretty f*cked up - especially goalkeeper Stefan Klos. So, we said to Ottmar that we were taking him out of training that day because he had a knee injury. The players had the afternoon off that day and many of them went water skiing. We, however, chugged over to Lucerne on a boat with Ottmar. During the trip, Stefan suddenly appeared next to us on water skis, didn’t notice Ottmar, and said with a loud laugh: ‘Hey, Zolle! The knee is perfect again!’. Ottmar saw that, of course, but he said something about it because he was just a brilliant guy</p>
