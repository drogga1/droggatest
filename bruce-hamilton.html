<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Morosini’s death that heart defects in young people are far more wide-ranging than many might have ever realised]</b> There’s a difference between a 25-year-old fit and healthy person and a 45-year-old ‘weekend warrior’. In a 25-year-old it is a combination of participating in an intense sport and having an underlying condition. We know the most common cause of death in a young person related to sport is due to hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, and that has an incidence in about one in 500 people, so one in 500 people out there playing sport will have this underlying condition that predisposes them to cardiac death<br /><br /><b>[There are a number of other causes as well, but if you just look at that number and think about the number of people playing all sports, let alone football, there are a lot of people at risk out there]</b> Some 80 to 90 per cent of people who die in sport will die of a cardiac cause. In total 200,000 will die per year of heart related causes while participating in sport</p>
