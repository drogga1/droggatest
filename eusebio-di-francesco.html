Joking aside, we have to dream and be ambitious. I am not interested about the team we will face. Now we have to think of taking in what we have done.<br /><br />We must keep the balance, I am going to repeat this word six times, balance within this context and think about the next game against Crotone.

  <p><b>[Roma vs Barcelona]</b> Why not believe until the end and hope we can achieve something unprecedented? We’re trailing by three goals, so it’s a really tough ask, but we have the duty to try</p>

  <p><b>[Roma overturned a 4-1 first leg lead in shocking fashion, beating the Catalan side 3-0 at the Stadio Olimpico]</b> I take the blame for defeats and some ungrateful words on social media, so I may as well take the credit for a win. The truth is that I made this choice to create more width, allow more counter-attacks and bring speed, but what really changed was the philosophy of the side and we have to continue like this now. Although we have had very good performances in Serie A, we are only now reaping the rewards - the just rewards - for the hard work we have done.</p>

  <p><b>[On chastening 5-2 Roma loss against Liverpool]</b> I think we deserved to score those two goals. The team proved to have soul but I didn’t like that we gave up during the second half.<br /><br />We controlled the first 20-25 minutes but then we started to lose too many duels. Football is not a game about systems, it is about winning those individual duels. It could have been more than five at one stage<br /><br />What I didn’t expect was to concede so many goals one after the other in second half. When you lose so many midfield duels, it’s hard to change the trend of the game. We gave away too many balls, we worked on it and knew they were lethal on the break in that area. I changed things as we lost shape, too much space and needed vitality and another striker to try to play and hold up the ball more<br /><br />There was a misunderstanding with the substitution. I asked them to play 4-3-3 and they played 4-2-3-1, then they scored the fifth goal, proving details make the difference<br /><br />We don’t need miracles. We just need to believe like against Barcelona and our fans will be there supporting us. This is the first Champions League semi-final for Roma in three decades, we’re not used to it. But let me remind you: the tie is not over. Whoever does not believe in the comeback can stay at home. I feel responsible, I am the most responsible here, but we are still playing in a semi-final</p>

  <p><b>[Eusebio Di Francesco voiced frustration with his own team as well as the referee]</b> I don’t raise my voice with UEFA, that is for the club. I have to raise my voice with the players, who have to believe and push forward if there are a few minutes left and seek another goal. I have anger and even more regret, because I do believe we could’ve done it and we wasted time. We mustn’t stand there arguing with the referee, he’s not going to change his mind, so we just played into Liverpool’s hands. That is what I can do something about and makes me angry. Obviously, 20-25 minutes from the end, a red card and penalty could’ve really had Liverpool on the ropes. However, we made mistakes too and those are what cost us.</p>

As far as we are concerned, we need to protect the one-goal advantage and go on the counter, which is fundamental. Defending stoutly will be the key and everyone else will follow.<br /><br />I am not playing tomorrow, it’s not my game and it is in everyone’s interests that Roma win</p>
