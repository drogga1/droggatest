  <p><b>[Montella and I aim to meet in the final - Di Francesco wants Roma-Sevilla showdown]</b> I spoke to <a href="vincenzo-montella.html">Vincenzo Montella</a> a few days ago and we aim to meet in the final, this is why as friends we do not want to face each other at this stage of the competition. Joking aside, we have to dream and be ambitious. I am not interested about the team we will face. Now we have to think of taking in what we have done.<br /><br />We must keep the balance, I am going to repeat this word six times, balance within this context and think about the next game against Crotone.
