  <p><b>[AS Roma boss Eusebio Di Francesco has questioned the reasoning behind the potential sale of Edin Dzeko to Chelsea]</b> What counts is the club. My own hopes are relative. If they sell him, they will have valid reasons, which they will explain to me. Do I hate the market? That depends: if someone arrives, no; otherwise, yes. In the event that he leaves, we will do something else. Schick has the characteristics, together with Defrel, of being able to play in several roles in attack. But it’s still to early to talk about it.<br /><br /><b>[Dzeko]</b> made himself available for the game, despite the many rumours. He is a player who sometimes you can see little of, but then he appears. It’s a choice for the club, determined by many factors. As long as I have the player I will play him, because he has always shown me commitment, seriousness and professionalism. Dzeko is a decisive player and he’s the one who scored the most goals for my team. The sooner the transfer market ends, the sooner we will find a Dzeko with more serenity. But for his part his availability is always the same</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Cengiz Under? Roma finally have their replacement for Liverpool star Salah]</b> Cengiz was a wise choice by the club, he needs to improve his choices, but since he arrived, he plays far more for the team than the individual. Cengiz is only 20, he came to Serie A from another world in football terms. We are not accustomed in Italy to waiting for young talent to develop and I say that with irritation. People are so quick to point the finger and claim he’s not good enough even to play for the Primavera youth team. You must wait for players to develop. Obviously a player like Cengiz needs a little more time to assimilate the change in league, the directives or movements that are asked of him. At this moment, the player has this capacity, sharpness and exuberance to transform what I ask for into something remarkable. I hope he can continue like this, but he must never give up or lose his humility. But if he keeps training with this determination and hunger, he can become a leader on the pitch.<br /><br /><b>[The winger had not been afforded a single minute during Roma’s group-stage campaign]</b> He is in the optimal psychological mindset and can make the most of any situation whereas a few weeks ago he was short on confidence and was hitting <b>[shots]</b> into the stands</p>

Joking aside, we have to dream and be ambitious. I am not interested about the team we will face. Now we have to think of taking in what we have done.<br /><br />We must keep the balance, I am going to repeat this word six times, balance within this context and think about the next game against Crotone.

  <p><b>[Roma overturned a 4-1 first leg lead in shocking fashion, beating the Catalan side 3-0 at the Stadio Olimpico]</b> I take the blame for defeats and some ungrateful words on social media, so I may as well take the credit for a win. The truth is that I made this choice to create more width, allow more counter-attacks and bring speed, but what really changed was the philosophy of the side and we have to continue like this now. Although we have had very good performances in Serie A, we are only now reaping the rewards - the just rewards - for the hard work we have done.</p>

  <p><b>[On chastening 5-2 Roma loss against Liverpool]</b> I think we deserved to score those two goals. The team proved to have soul but I didn’t like that we gave up during the second half.<br /><br />We controlled the first 20-25 minutes but then we started to lose too many duels. Football is not a game about systems, it is about winning those individual duels. It could have been more than five at one stage<br /><br />What I didn’t expect was to concede so many goals one after the other in second half. When you lose so many midfield duels, it’s hard to change the trend of the game. We gave away too many balls, we worked on it and knew they were lethal on the break in that area. I changed things as we lost shape, too much space and needed vitality and another striker to try to play and hold up the ball more<br /><br />There was a misunderstanding with the substitution. I asked them to play 4-3-3 and they played 4-2-3-1, then they scored the fifth goal, proving details make the difference<br /><br />We don’t need miracles. We just need to believe like against Barcelona and our fans will be there supporting us. This is the first Champions League semi-final for Roma in three decades, we’re not used to it. But let me remind you: the tie is not over. Whoever does not believe in the comeback can stay at home. I feel responsible, I am the most responsible here, but we are still playing in a semi-final</p>

  <p><b>[Eusebio Di Francesco voiced frustration with his own team as well as the referee]</b> I don’t raise my voice with UEFA, that is for the club. I have to raise my voice with the players, who have to believe and push forward if there are a few minutes left and seek another goal. I have anger and even more regret, because I do believe we could’ve done it and we wasted time. We mustn’t stand there arguing with the referee, he’s not going to change his mind, so we just played into Liverpool’s hands. That is what I can do something about and makes me angry. Obviously, 20-25 minutes from the end, a red card and penalty could’ve really had Liverpool on the ropes. However, we made mistakes too and those are what cost us.</p>
