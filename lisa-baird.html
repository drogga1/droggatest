  <p><b>[Coronavirus strikes a blow to the NWSL - can it bounce back?]</b> I think the National Women’s Soccer League is not only a women’s sport and entertainment, but we’re also a movement. I think fans will continue to want to be a part of that<br /><br />The NWSL Board of Directors approved the creation of a schedule that targets kickoff for the last weekend in June. Our staff has been working extremely hard to operationalize the new schedule along with all contingency plans and safety protocols<br /><br />As much as ticket sales for women’s sports are important, the league has diverse revenue streams, including new multiyear broadcast deals with CBS and the streaming service Twitch</p>

This exciting month-long tournament will showcase our league’s talented players and provide our fans the type of world-class entertainment they’ve come to expect from the NWSL</p>
