  <p><b>[<a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> admits to handball that defeated Ireland in World Cup play-off]</b> All European people saw the situation. I am sure that, if the referee had asked Henry, he would have admitted to the handball. I would prefer to go out on penalties than this. I am sad because the referee had the time to ask the linesman and Henry. I am upset for fair play because we are told many times about fair play. We didn’t change the rules three months ago. I go into schools to talk about fair play and tell the young kids that it’s important for their life</p>

  <p><b>[In response to Cristiano Doni’s admission to charges of match-fixing, the 72-year-old says he had always believed his former national team protege was an intelligent man but confessed that his view of him has taken a turn for the worse]</b> I thought he was intelligent, I’ve changed my mind because he wasn’t to end up where he is. There is <b>[a certain]</b> bitterness. I’m referring to us, the coaches who work abroad. Certainly there is a feeling of bitterness because we end up a little tainted as Italian cheats. The first word they say is ‘Italian mafia’ and that is really displeasing. A system exists, not only an Italian one, that whomever bets is part of the game but those who don’t have a part in that rule are the footballers. If a system exists in which the matches are manipulated and rigged, it’s a slap which damages our football</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Trapattoni praises <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> impact with Ireland]</b> Keane is doing well. He has experience and ideas. He’s putting the things that he learned as a player into practice as a coach.<br /><br />He’s had a beautiful human and professional experience in Ireland, having the opportunity to work with cutting-edge facilities and the chance to enjoy a great relationship with the people; who are always passionate about the national team and above all else, always respectful towards the work of the coaches.<br /><br /><b>[in June 2012. the former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> coach promptly dismissed Keane’s comments, suggesting that the Cork native had not done much of note since moving into management]</b> It is not my habit to be critical of other colleagues as coaches or managers, but what has he done after he finished playing? <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was a great player. He obtained very good results as a player. Now that he is a coach he should just stick to focusing on getting results as a coach.<br /><br /><b>[Ireland have been drawn in Group E along with Italy, Sweden and Belgium at the tournament and Trapattoni feels that, while other teams are technically stronger, Ireland’s physicality and tactical nous means that they can still achieve something]</b> Ireland can have a good run at the Euros. With compactness and good tactics, they can think of doing well. It’s clear that from a technical point of view, there are stronger squads and therefore Ireland will have to fight a lot to try to do well<br /><br /><b>[Despite ending his time with Ireland on a low point, the Trapattoni insists that he is ‘happy’ to have managed the Boys in Green]</b> We did something great through hard work and I’m very happy to have had that experience. When I trained Ireland, only the prowess of <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> managed to beat us. Ireland is a squad with great gifts in terms of character and never gives up. On an athletic and physical level, they’re leaders. Tactically, it’s a team that has grown a lot</p>

  <p><b>[On Italian Coaches]</b> Italian clubs cannot afford the same transfer fees as the other leagues, but you cannot buy ideas. In that sense, our school of coaching is at the vanguard. What stands Italian coaches out above the rest is our minute attention to detail. They are beyond compare when it comes to tactical knowledge and the ability to form a group dynamic.<br /><br />They know what needs to be done in order to win and adapt well to the countries they find themselves in. When I was at Juventus and we didn’t play well, my president Gianni Agnelli would come to me and say: ‘Trapattoni, today I was not entertained, but the important thing is that we won. Well done’.</p>

  <p><b>[Mateo Kovacic is probably unsuited to a role that requires such tactical discipline]</b> If left free to invent up front and with space, Kovacic can be very dangerous. He isn’t a director like <b>[Andrea]</b> Pirlo. Kovacic tends to dribble more, has a lot of technique and great acceleration. He’s a class player and I think his skills should be exploited to the best. I wouldn’t burden Kovacic with tactical tasks now.</p>
