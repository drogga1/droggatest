<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Will DC United’s Chris Durkin be the next breakout American teenager in MLS?]</b> I think guys like Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic have set a standard, and I think it’s a standard I can achieve. I know they have sacrificed a lot, and have immersed themselves completely in the culture, and I think more Americans can follow that path.<br /><br />It’s definitely inspiring and motivating, but I also know every player has their own path. Some people are going to start younger than others, but it’s for sure motivating to find minutes professionally<br /><br /><b>[Durkin just turned 18 last week]</b> I think it’s a huge year, especially coming off a U-17 World Cup. That’s typically when teams in Europe and players in Europe start to shoot upward. I want to still follow that trajectory they follow, and get meaningful minutes, wherever that is. My main focus is playing and developing. Wherever that is, I think that fits me best<br /><br />I know the competition is really difficult right now, with obviously Russell Canouse and Ian Harkes, and some other players we’ve signed. I know the midfield is loaded right now, so it’ll be difficult, but I’ve had some talks with Ben and I think he’ll give me a fair shot in preseason, but it’s obviously up to me to show I’m ready to start in MLS<br /><br />I know that there is serious interest, and there are some offers, but I’m just focusing on preseason, and letting my agent and all the staff and D.C. handle that, because if I get too focused on that it’ll consume me. I have to focus on the football</p>
