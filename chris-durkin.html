  <p><b>[Chris Durkin was one of the goal scorers for USMNT in their 3-0 win over India in their Group A opener at the Under-17 World Cup on Friday evening]</b> The atmosphere was amazing. When I was walking out of the tunnel, I had a smile. To see 40000 people for an Under-17 World Cup is great for the growth of soccer in India. It was a tough game. The Indian players were confident especially with the PM <b>[Shri Narendra Modi]</b> coming out and shaking their hand.<br /><br />I do think that the Indian team are hard to break down in certain moments. I would give props to them for their intensity and the work. We did do some long balls but credit to the Indian team as they stayed resilient throughout the game.<br /><br />I think that the sports scientist of the national team has worked on our fitness which is top notch. We were complacent with our passes. We can play a bit better. That’s why you could see more chances for India. Credit to India for giving us a difficult game</p>

  <p><b>[Will DC United’s Chris Durkin be the next breakout American teenager in MLS?]</b> I think guys like Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic have set a standard, and I think it’s a standard I can achieve. I know they have sacrificed a lot, and have immersed themselves completely in the culture, and I think more Americans can follow that path.<br /><br />It’s definitely inspiring and motivating, but I also know every player has their own path. Some people are going to start younger than others, but it’s for sure motivating to find minutes professionally<br /><br /><b>[Durkin just turned 18 last week]</b> I think it’s a huge year, especially coming off a U-17 World Cup. That’s typically when teams in Europe and players in Europe start to shoot upward. I want to still follow that trajectory they follow, and get meaningful minutes, wherever that is. My main focus is playing and developing. Wherever that is, I think that fits me best<br /><br />I know the competition is really difficult right now, with obviously Russell Canouse and Ian Harkes, and some other players we’ve signed. I know the midfield is loaded right now, so it’ll be difficult, but I’ve had some talks with Ben and I think he’ll give me a fair shot in preseason, but it’s obviously up to me to show I’m ready to start in MLS<br /><br />I know that there is serious interest, and there are some offers, but I’m just focusing on preseason, and letting my agent and all the staff and D.C. handle that, because if I get too focused on that it’ll consume me. I have to focus on the football</p>
