  <p><b>[Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaeda leader is dead. Announcing the success of the operation, Mr Obama said it was]</b> the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaeda.<br /><br /><b>[Mr Obama said he had been briefed last August on a possible lead to Bin Laden’s whereabouts. He authorised the operation last week once he determined there was enough intelligence to take action]</b> It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground</p>

  <p><b>[United States President Barack Obama speaking to the reigning <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup™ champions during a ceremony at the White House]</b> This team taught all America’s children that ‘playing like a girl’ means you’re a badass … Playing like a girl means being the best. It means drawing the largest TV audience for a soccer match - men or women’s - in American history. It means wearing our nation’s crest on your jersey, taking yourself and your country to the top of the world. That’s what American women do. That’s what American girls do. That’s why we celebrate this team. They’ve done it with class. They’ve done it the right way. They’ve done it with excitement. They’ve done it with style. We are very, very proud of them</p>

He’s a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term</p>
