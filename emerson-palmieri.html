  <p><b>[Emerson Palmieri prefers <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> stay over Inter move]</b> It is true that in these last few months I have played a lot more, but I already felt I am a player who is well adapted to English football. There is a lot more intensity to the game here, both going forward and certainly in the defensive phase so, without having learned to be more intense as a player, you could not play in my role here in England. I feel I’m well adapted to that. Here, at times, the tactics are left behind, and it becomes about intensity and strength so, if you are that kind of player, it’s easier to adapt yourself to the game here</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have begun talks over a new contract for left-back Emerson Palmieri following an impressive start to the season]</b> I think it’s the best period of my career. I’m very happy at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, just as I was last season, but obviously a player is always happier when he plays regularly</p>

  <p><b>[Emerson Palmieri said he could return to Serie A]</b> I was very happy in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, including with the culture, which is also why I chose to play for Italy. A return to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> could happen, but I have a contract with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I’m in no rush to go anywhere. It has been a wonderful experience at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, as first there was <b>[Antonio]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, so obviously it was easier to deal with an Italian coach. As for <b>[Maurizio]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, I’ve no words for what a marvellous year we had, as we finished third in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, reached the Carabao Cup final and won the Europa League. We can’t complain!<br /><br />I learned a lot from <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, he proved himself to be a fantastic coach, but I think for the time we worked together and the results we achieved, I got even more from <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>. <b>[Luciano]</b> <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a> at Roma is more of a friend or a father figure, he talks to you every day, asks about your family, makes sure you’re happy. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is more focused on the pitch, but you can tell he’s got a gigantic heart, even if he doesn’t speak as much. They are quite similar, although <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is more tactical and focused, while <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a> leaves a little more room for fun in his training sessions. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> definitely got angrier!<br /><br /><b>[Emerson has been impressed by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Frank Lampard]</b> He is very intelligent, he is young and he knows how to communicate with the players. He was an idol here at Chelsea; he will grow a lot. All the fans are in love with him. Every day I try to listen to him, he was a fantastic player, I’ve never seen a midfielder capable of 400 goals. Before, I only saw him in video games, working with him gives you a wonderful feeling</p>
