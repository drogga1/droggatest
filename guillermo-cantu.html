  <p><b>[The Mexico national team rolled out its English-language social media accounts]</b> Well, basically there are more than 40 million fans of the Mexican national team in the United States. We practically have two territories - Mexico and the United States - because of the amount of fans we have in both countries. We could call it our second home. For us, it’s really important to come and have games here. Of course, as I said, we have to ‘start speaking English.’ That’s why I have this shirt to start engagement in English. For us, it’s really important to have a partner in <b>[Soccer United Marketing]</b> in this venture we started 16 years ago and has grown in all aspects over time</p>

  <p><b>[The Mexico soccer federation’s secretary general welcomed the news that FIFA’s task force has named the North American bid between the United States, Mexico and Canada a lower-risk than that of Morocco]</b> It confirms what we knew that having a responsible candidacy with all the stadiums already constructed, all the training bases practically constructed and operating, all the communication centers mostly ready now and definitely ready within eight years. For us, being part of CONCACAF, we’re very proud, calm in the sense of confirming what we’ve said from the start of a responsible candidacy was that was part of what we wanted from the start. When we talk about unity, about responsibility, of everything organizing a World Cup would imply, I think we’re on the right path.<br /><br />We can’t say anything because the vote is June 13. For us, it’s very important to continue to finish visiting the majority or all FIFA’s Member Associations because they’re the ones who are going to vote and they’re the ones who need to hear our voices that we’ve run a responsible bid<br /><br />With a format like is going to happen from 2026 with 48 national teams I think there are very few countries, maybe none, that could organize a World Cup alone. What we’re saying is the cooperation between countries, and this opens the door to a lot of other countries that couldn’t host a World Cup by themselves but collaborating with neighbors they could after 2026</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico players’s party shouldn’t affect World Cup performance]</b> The day off is a day off. Those are the risks you run with giving freedom. Really, it’s not about whether we like it or not, we simply have to make it very clear that they didn’t miss any training session or squad meetings.</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Cantu says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> turned down Mexico job in 2015 in favour of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move]</b> I asked through a third party if he’d be interested in the Mexican national team and the message back was, ‘I appreciate it, many thanks, but I still have a lot to do in club football and I want to go to England<br /><br /><b>[Mexico would go on to hire <a href="juan-carlos-osorio.html">Juan Carlos Osorio</a> as manager in 2015]</b> If you told me, ‘You will choose a coach who will finish the three years with a 70 per cent <b>[win record]</b>,’ I’d sign off on it 40 times. He always played to win, I think we can appreciate that. They made fun of him when he said, ‘We have to go out and beat Germany’</p>
