  <p><b>[Malaga sack <a href="victor-sanchez-del-amo.html">Victor Sanchez del Amo</a> after explicit video causes ‘serious damage’]</b> MCF has used best endeavours to attempt to resolve the situation amicably through intense negotiations with Víctor Sanchez del Amo. However, despite the ongoing and incessant efforts undertaken by the club, it has not been possible to reach a friendly separation. As such, MCF has made the decision to dismiss Víctor Sanchez del Amo due to disciplinary reasons, in accordance with the applicable regulations. MCF has made the decision, taking into account the serious damage caused to the institution by the recent events, aiming to minimise the impact on the team and the entire MCF organisation.
