<blockquote>
  <p>[Pulling the young Englishman aside, Atlanta captain Michael Parkhurst had to ask: Did Martino tip him off about the start?] Yeah. I found out five minutes ago.<br /><br />I wouldn’t shy away from how I felt - I was nervous. You just try to push the nerves away because regardless of whatever game I’m going into, whenever I know I’ll be playing I always apply pressure on myself to perform<br /><br />They just said the opportunity was there for the taking, and I could have a few weeks to think about it and just get my mindset around it because that’s a big step. It’s not like going away in England where you might be a few hours or even 20 minutes, 30 minutes away from home. But my decision was made in a few days<br /><br />To be a part of an expansion team in a league which is growing so quickly with the quality of players that are here, it would be very hard to say no at this moment in time. It was something that didn’t require much thought. You don’t know what to expect, but just from how everything was being handled you could tell the team was being built to be a great team from the beginning<br /><br />It’s just wherever I can play football - that’s always going to be the key. Things have been wonderful here, so my main focus isn’t really going past the remaining games and the playoffs<br /><br />It’s a great quality of football. There’s been a few people who have criticized it, and that’s just a lack of knowledge really because this league is a great league with very good players. This league is only expanding, so I don’t see why any player wouldn’t want to come here at some stage of their career because it’s amazing</p>
