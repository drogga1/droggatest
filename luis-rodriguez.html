  <p><b>[Rodriguez achieved that distinction back in 2014, after scoring an incredible strike against Independiente from the halfway line in a Nacional B game. At the final whistle, match official Alejandro Castro shook his hand and even asked the playmaker for his boots as a souvenir]</b> Football boots are expensive; that’s why I didn’t give them to him.<br /><br /><b>[The star continues to live in his tiny hometown of Simoca, 50 kilometres from Atletico’s home of San Miguel de Tucuman, commuting every day to training]</b> It is the place where I grew up, where everything I do goes unnoticed. To my neighbours I am just another Simoqueno, not a footballer. Nobody asks for photos or autographs and I move around with complete anonymity<br /><br />At 17, almost 18 I was ready to give it all up. I was tricked by this crazy guy I had for an agent, who told me I was going to play in Romania. There was supposedly a contract all sorted and when I went to collect my wages I don’t know what happened. Nobody could tell me. I ended up stranded in a train station without knowing the language, penniless, without any food. I got home however I could and told my mother I was quitting; that I didn’t want to play anymore<br /><br /><b>[Salvation came in the form of brother Walter, who had shined with Racing de Cordoba as a pro before injury forced him to retire]</b> How much do you want to earn?’ the president asked me. I don’t know, I just want to play again<br /><br /><b>[The proudest moment of Rodriguez’s career came back in 2010. Then-Argentina coach Diego Maradona, perhaps seeing a kindred spirit in the squat trickster, handed him his first and only Albiceleste]</b> I can say that was the most wonderful thing I have experienced and even better. It was with the greatest of all time, who even gave me a team talk.</p>

  <p><b>[More on the line for Tigres, Monterrey than just Clasico Regio bragging rights]</b> I think it gives us a lot of confidence. It’s a title that we needed and for the Clasico I think we come in on good form. We couldn’t have come into it better.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> finds ideal fullbacks for his system in Jesus Gallardo and Luis Rodriguez]</b> I feel really comfortable. I think all of us who are playing are enjoying it right now. Tata is a smart manager who knows how to get the potential out of every player and you’re seeing that on the field</p>
