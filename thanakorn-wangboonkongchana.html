Mr Thanathorn was lying through his teeth when he slandered us. This is the dirtiest political trick ever. No one in our party has ever done so. We’ve never thought a new generation like Mr Thanathorn would do this. What he said also damages the judicial system since no one can intervene it.</p>

This is an extension of the aim to safeguard the nation, religion and monarchy, rather than an extension of the dictatorial power</p>

The seven parties that voted for <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> should prepare to work as the opposition to check the government and fight in Parliament rather than engage in verbal attack on General <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a>, so politics can become more constructive like the people want</p>
