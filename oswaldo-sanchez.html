<blockquote>
  <p>[Mexico legend Oswaldo Sanchez says Rafa Marquez has to be included in El Tri’s final World Cup squad] I don’t think there are old or young players in soccer, just players who are talented and others who don’t have it. I think Rafa fills the role as a player who has a lot of talent and that’s why he should be in the national team because he can help you on the field or off it.<br /><br />I’ve seen [Ochoa’s development] go well. He’s already played a World Cup and he did really well in Brazil, making some really important saves. He’s a goalkeeper who has the personality needed to be the starter for the national team, who arrived at this stage with a lot of maturity. This national team has goalkeepers who have a lot of experience. [Ochoa] just won the cup in Belgium and finally has a European title. For me, the team can rely on Memo. He’s a player who has a lot of confidence in himself, he has great reflexes. I know him really well because when I was at America he was in the school there. I’ve seen him train a lot and he’s always shown me the desire to be a pro goalkeeper and that’s why I’d say Mexico doesn’t have any problems in goal, because Memo Ochoa is a great goalkeeper and because if he can’t be there, [Alfredo] Talavera and [Jesus] Corona both are there and can do things well<br /><br />Coming in, they qualified easily, practically ‘caminando’ [walking], almost doing it undefeated and getting a lot of points. Now we’ve also got a lot of players who are playing at important clubs, and that can help the national team. There are 11 players, and in some way this experience these guys have gotten in Europe can help the young Mexican players who have come in doing things well and have the desire to get to the national team and shore up their place. I think this mix of experienced and young players, and above all the experience a player like Rafa Marquez, who looks like he’ll be on the list, has can really help the national team at the World Cup because he can bring something different</p>
