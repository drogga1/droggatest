  <p><b>[Riyad Mahrez was determined to leave Leicester in 2017]</b> Riyad, he was very, very determined to leave. Because he was already thinking of leaving the summer before. He thought he had an agreement with the club so he could leave if he had any requests. And the proposals, he had them, with those of Manchester City in particular. The problem is that the proposal arrived late and it was difficult to replace him, to prepare his succession. The club was not ready to see him leave. It was a good solution for the club and also for Riyad because that didn’t prevent him from leaving in July for City. His first steps in Man City? I find that for his first matches, he didn’t shine. We could see that he was trying to make his mark. But after a month, he is an important element and he has found his effectiveness. He scores and makes goals. I think he is progressing because he defends much more than in Leicester. I congratulate him personally because he is someone I really appreciate. In addition, he is trained by a superb coach and surrounded by exceptional players. And he will still progress.<br /><br /><b>[Vardy remains Leicester’s star]</b> He’s a great professional, very conscientious, very serious and very involved in his club. But, you know, there are players who have experience, and who have adopted work habits of which it’s difficult to change. Sometimes you have to arrange it or accept the fact that from time to time the players want to manage themselves. Because the player has come to the point when he knows himself very well, and he knows he needs to do a little more one day, and a little less another to be able to perform on the day of the match</p>

  <p><b>[Trophies will give Liverpool ‘monster’ Van Dijk extra dimension]</b> Trophies will give Liverpool ‘monster’ Van Dijk extra dimension. Technically he’s a monster, Physically he’s a monster. He has everything. The titles will give him an extra dimension but he is already a very complete player. Maybe he should be aware of complacency, because he is so comfortable that he can lose his concentration, but I do not see any limits<br /><br />at strikes me first is his physique, he is very tall and very strong. He has a good head and exudes a lot of power, he also exudes a certain charisma, with personality. It translates into training, into the application that he puts to work. As soon as there was a competitive aspect, he wanted to win every game in training. He’s a technical leader because he is very strong. He commands, he recites and encourages. It takes up space in a group. He has a big ego. Virgil is someone you shouldn’t take lightly. It must be managed accordingly. In times when the opponent wins, he hates losing. he displays his bad mood</p>
