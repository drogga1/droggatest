<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Sevilla striker Kepa Blanco has hailed his side’s decision to permanently sign Andre Silva from AC Milan]</b> The prices nowadays are exorbitant and to find a footballer with his age and the level he is demonstrating is very complicated. It is very valuable for the team’s sporting direction to work with a player that in terms of age and numbers is giving exceptional performances.<br /><br /><b>[Blanco has been impressed with how Silva has adapted to life in Spain, both on and off the pitch]</b> I think it is very striking that a player adapts so quickly to a different playing system, to a different city and doesn’t only adapt on a personal level, but a sporting level. He plays very well on with his back to goal, he has great movements, he gets rid of the ball when he has to, he does defensive work, he is a supportive footballer with the team and with his effort. We are talking about one of the best strikers in La Liga</p>
