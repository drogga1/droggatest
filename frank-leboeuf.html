It is hard for me to criticise my former club and I love them but I really feel they are at the end of the cycle. When I saw them flying at the top at the start of the season, I wondered if I knew anything about football any more but now we are seeing the truth and reality of that club and those players<br /><br />They need to do something at the end of the season where they will need to sell and buy players.

I am not sure they have an answer, that’s the problem.<br /><br />Two years ago they booed Andre Pierre Gignac and now when he comes on they cheer him, there is no sense in football. Dugary had that problem, even Michel Platini had that problem when he was booed and I remember <b>[David]</b> Beckham being booed after 98 and then he became a fantastic player and loved by all English fans<br /><br />It is getting better because he scored two goals last week.

  <p><b>[Frank Leboeuf believes recovering the form of Eden Hazard will be more important in turning around Chelsea’s fortunes than new signings]</b> First they need some leaders and the first guy I think about is Eden Hazard. They need those guys to get back to their best if they want to be successful again. Buying other players when you know you have Hazard and if Hazard doesn’t go back to his best Chelsea are not going to win anything.<br /><br />When they won <b>[their last trophy]</b>, he was the best player in the Premier League, last year he scored three or four goals in the season and it is not enough. So you have to rethink Chelsea maybe buying players but the players you keep have to be at 100%, they have to react</p>

  <p><b>[France great Frank Leboeuf has described N’Golo Kante’s remarkable rise to prominence as a nightmare that has become a fairytale]</b> I have followed his progress since he signed in England. It is kind of a nightmare that has become a fairytale. How come we didn’t see his qualities before he signed for Caen and then Leicester? I know it was hard for him, it was completely unfair but now he is there and now I can’t see him letting it go. Every time he plays, he is fantastic. He has three caps with the national team, in three caps they ran a poll in France, asking if Kante should be in the first eleven and it was close to 95 percent. He seduced everybody in a second, with his charisma but also with his football.<br /><br /><b>[Kante’s family live just 300 yards from Leboeuf’s house in France]</b> That would be great, he already has a blue shirt but he can get a better one. He is part of the new generation alongside Lassana Diarra, in a similar role to Claude Makelele beforehand. They are the same kind of players and absolutely fantastic. He is a fantastic player, rarely have I seen a player who has seduced me like that and his future is really bright</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Leboeuf believes that Antonio Conte has the ability to make Chelsea an attacking and entertaining team]</b> Italian football has changed, when I was a player I didn’t want to go to Italy because it was boring as a defender. Conte is part of the new generation of coaches in Italy where it is more offensive and seductive football. They needed a change and I like those coaches who are between their 40s and 50s who have a new idea of football, like Jose Mourinho, like Didier Deschamps, like Laurent Blanc - we need a new generation of coach to bring something new.<br /><br />I really think he can do well, he’s been successful, he was a fantastic player and he is a real leader. I think it is a good idea, we will see. Last season was very appalling, I went to the Paris Saint-Germain game over the two ties and I never saw Chelsea, that was too easy for PSG. Chelsea now has to react</p>

He’s an extraordinary soldier, a warrior, but he doesn’t have the personality nor the stature of a leader. With Kante on the bench, you don’t have a problem. With Pogba on the bench, you perhaps have a problem. There is a phrase that sums up Kante exactly: ‘Kante is the motor, but not the pilot’.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea players got Jose Mourinho sacked, now they are after Antonio Conte]</b> It’s a lack of respect for the fans and the club, both on the manager’s part, because he’s already packed his bags, but also from the players. We saw it with Mourinho, it seemed like some of the players were almost losing on purpose so the manager can get sacked as quickly as possible. I knew a team that was hungry for trophies, wanted to win. Now, it doesn’t seem that way. One year you win the league, the next it’s a mess.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has been warned that his inconsistency for Manchester United and France is set to see him benched at World Cup 2018]</b> He’s under lots of pressure and he’s been heavily criticised.

I think <b>[Blaise]</b> Matuidi is above him. I mean <b>[he]</b> has the talent, but we don’t see it for the national team for the past two or three years. Pogba talks about winning the Ballon d’Or and put himself in the situation where right now he cannot <b>[back up]</b> what he says. I think he’s a good guy and I think he has the talent, but he puts too much pressure on himself saying he wants to be the Ballon d’Or, that he was the key of the national team, that he wants to be the No. 1. Just don’t say anything, just work hard. You can <b>[say]</b> the words if you show on the pitch that you are the best, but otherwise just be quiet and work hard.

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is yet to rediscover his big appetite for success at club level]</b> It was very hard to come back to Chelsea, to the training ground, to start running, to think we had to play the first game away to Coventry. As Paul said, you touch the stars. For thousands of people it wasn’t a dream, it was a fantasy. Suddenly you win it and you have to find the goals to make sure you still have a big appetite in football. You go through a kind of a depression where you have to find what you’re fighting for. Maybe that’s what Paul is living right now with all the players. You have to find back the pleasure of being back with your friends and liking sweating and suffering for the sake of it. It comes little by little. You have to work hard to try and win trophies, it’s the only way to make sure you’re still concerned about your sport</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> told £80m for <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is ‘too much’ as Leboeuf questions quality of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> flop]</b> Well, to be really honest, and frank, no <b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should not sign him]</b>. I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is a good player and I’m not even trying to be harsh on him, I think I want to find <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> guilty for the situation because they put a price on <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> who I think doesn’t belong to that league.<br /><br />Now it’s hard to reverse the system, it’s hard to think that you can even the price and accept to lose like £65m for a transfer. But if you check on the quality of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, of course he is a talented player, of course he is a good player, but does he belong to the top, top players? Allow me to have some doubts about that.<br /><br />When I see <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, when I see <b>[Cristiano]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, when I see <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, when I see <b>[Kylian]</b> <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, I see top, top players. <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> has a price of a top, top player and I don’t want to make a statement but I’m not sure he has the quality of a top, top player<br /><br />And now, how do you reverse the system? How do you put <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> in a team and how do you rate him now? You talk about <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, ready to <b>[pay]</b> £80m. I think it’s too much for a player where you’re not sure he’s going to find the level he was, he used to be, at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and is not anymore. That’s why I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> shouldn’t go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because there is no room for him and I think it is too much to spend for a player where we don’t know the standard</p>

  <p><b>[Leboeuf says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> lacks consistency]</b> There is a frustration and it’s understandable when you have seen his performances. He started pretty well, he showed that he could be a leader but I think there is a lack of consistency in his game. No doubt that he is a fantastic player, he’s shown it at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and at the beginning when he joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />Since then there seems to be so many problems around him, around the club, or around his team-mates that in fact, we don’t see the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> we want to see with all the qualities that he has. Maybe he’s a leader in the dressing room but he doesn’t show that he can be a technical leader like <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> immediately showed to the crowd when he signed for Manchester United<br /><br />Good players can always play together, so definitely, they can - it’s a big yes. I think it’s exciting… we do have an exciting squad. I’ve got Scott (McTominay), <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>, Nemanja (Matic). There are many games coming up and I’m sure we can find a good connection between them. We’ve been discussing that as a coaching team of course, and we’re looking forward to it.<br /><br />Of course Bruno coming in, making the impact he made, it was a boost for everyone, the club, supporters and players. Getting Paul and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> back would be fantastic.<br /><br />Paul has had a difficult season with injuries, and Marcus as well is getting back. So for us, and for them too, this gives them a chance to start on a par or even ahead of other players.</p>

The goal he scored was very clever, between the goalkeeper’s legs. He’s the master orchestrator of that team and I talked about him last week and I said that’s a player that I would hire for sure.

I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will need a player like that. I don’t know if <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> will be interested, but even if they have two very good central defenders, <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> I think belongs to another level and would fit very well.

You have to make a choice at certain points. The question was ‘what is the best fit for <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a>?’ and definitely with <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>, and when you’re a defender like <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a>, that would be the best central defence in the world.</p>
