It is hard for me to criticise my former club and I love them but I really feel they are at the end of the cycle.

  <p><b>[Leboeuf backs second season for <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, Blues boss]</b> I am always the kind of guy who likes to give a second chance, because it was the case everywhere in England with all clubs that I saw. Even if they had a bad season they kept their coach because they tried to work on their abilities. Now it seems that after a year, if it is not good it, ‘Goodbye’. But at the end of the day, if <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League then he deserves another chance.<br /><br />I didn’t agree with everything he decided, like changing <b>[N’Golo Kante]</b>(n-golo-kante.html) for example from a holding midfield player to a midfielder on the side.

I don’t have any kind of respect for a player like him.<br /><br />Yes, he’s a great player and he’s having a great career, but he’s a shyster, a complainer, a guy who I don’t have any respect for. I can’t stand a player like that on the football pitch, he’s a bad example for young people. What he did with the handball against Ghana at the World Cup, he was very happy, the two times he’s bitten rivals. If he played against me, they’d send me off, it surprises me that his rivals have cold blood against him, I’d do anything to make sure he didn’t finish the game either</p>

I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is a good player and I’m not even trying to be harsh on him, I think I want to find <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> guilty for the situation because they put a price on <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> who I think doesn’t belong to that league.<br /><br />Now it’s hard to reverse the system, it’s hard to think that you can even the price and accept to lose like £65m for a transfer. But if you check on the quality of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, of course he is a talented player, of course he is a good player, but does he belong to the top, top players?

  <p><b>[Leboeuf says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> lacks consistency]</b> There is a frustration and it’s understandable when you have seen his performances. He started pretty well, he showed that he could be a leader but I think there is a lack of consistency in his game. No doubt that he is a fantastic player, he’s shown it at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and at the beginning when he joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />Since then there seems to be so many problems around him, around the club, or around his team-mates that in fact, we don’t see the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> we want to see with all the qualities that he has. Maybe he’s a leader in the dressing room but he doesn’t show that he can be a technical leader like <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> immediately showed to the crowd when he signed for Manchester United<br /><br />Good players can always play together, so definitely, they can - it’s a big yes. I think it’s exciting… we do have an exciting squad. I’ve got Scott (McTominay), <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>, Nemanja (Matic). There are many games coming up and I’m sure we can find a good connection between them. We’ve been discussing that as a coaching team of course, and we’re looking forward to it.<br /><br />Of course Bruno coming in, making the impact he made, it was a boost for everyone, the club, supporters and players. Getting Paul and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> back would be fantastic.<br /><br />Paul has had a difficult season with injuries, and Marcus as well is getting back. So for us, and for them too, this gives them a chance to start on a par or even ahead of other players.</p>
