  <p><b>[<a href="eibar.html">Eibar</a> head coach Jose Mendilibar believes <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> attacker <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> doesn’t need to miss any games because he can simply rest while on the pitch]</b> I don’t think <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> rests. This b*stard rests in the game. He knows when he has to participate, when to rest. If he was given the day off he would have a worse time watching from the stands and get more tired<br /><br />Once with Osasuna, we went to play a Copa del Rey game <b>[at the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>]</b>. In the morning of the game <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> was ruled out because he had a problem with his stomach and had fever. After eating, he was called up, he was on the bench, we were losing 2-0 and suddenly I see him warming up. He came on, scored two goals and we lost 4-0.<br /><br /><b>[Mendilibar believes they are capable of testing <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> on their own turf]</b> We’ve been watching what they are doing. You see everything they do and it looks like a scary movie. We have to be convinced that we can also have something to say. I don’t know if it will be a lot or a bit, but if there is something we do well, it’s putting all the obstacles of the world in front of the opponent. We don’t have to be afraid or doubtful</p>
