  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid’s Filipe Luis picked up a thigh muscle in his side’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea]</b> After contact with the medical department at Atletico Madrid, and with Filipe himself, we discovered it is the type of injury that requires a recovery period of at least 15 days. We have decided to withdraw him from the squad and allow him to continue his recovery process from a distance.</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho, meanwhile, has been out of action with his club, Liverpool, and took part in light warm-up exercises at Stade Chartely]</b> Coutinho is in the final phase of his recovery and we knew he would not arrive fully fit, but we chose for him to finish his recovery with us. The possibility of him playing against Japan is remote, but we will work to make him available against England. He will likely have to be on the bench, and could maybe only manage a few minutes. There is only a small chance of that, but we will work hard to get him fit for the second game.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar faces a race to be fit for the World Cup after Brazil’s national team doctor stated his recovery will take an estimated three months]</b> It was a small fissure <b>[in the fifth metatarsal of the right foot]</b>, a major fracture of a bone in the middle of the foot, and the operation will be on Saturday morning in Belo Horizonte. We do not have the exact time, but the surgery will certainly be on Saturday. It will be two and a half months to three months of recovery for Neymar. After surgery we will have more details about this time. He is sad, upset, but understands that he has no alternative but to recover as soon as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar ‘sad’ after ‘scary’ injury but on course for World Cup]</b> He became very sad when he found out the seriousness of the injury and learned he needed surgery. On the eve of a competition like the World Cup, it’s always a little scary. He became really annoyed in the first moments, but his power of recovery and his mental strength allowed him to overcome that.<br /><br />What is certain is that he wants to return as soon as possible. But after the operation, we set a target of six weeks before examining the evolution of his recuperation. From there, we’ll do further imaging and detailed reviews that will help us define that return. We have to wait to see how it will be for that so we can detail the next steps and establish the day in which he can return to the field<br /><br />In no way <b>[did we disagree]</b>. Our relation with Dr. Rolland is very good and is not new. We’ve known each other for a long time. Over the years, we established a professional relationship, but also a friendly one. Before Neymar’s injury, there was never a problem of misunderstanding with PSG. And I insist, because it’s important, there wasn’t, during this episode, any discrepancy between CBF <b>[the Brazilian football federation]</b> and PSG. Since the first day, we had the same thinking in that I said I respect the diagnosis and necessary treatment. There was total harmony among us.</p>

  <p><b>[Blow for Brazil as Dani Alves ruled out of World Cup]</b> Following Daniel Alves’ right knee injury, which occurred yesterday during the French Cup final, the tests performed today showed a high detachment of the anterior cruciate ligament with posterolateral sprain. Close examinations confirmed the initial diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament injury, requiring surgical treatment. Considering the alternative recovery options within the timeframe, it confirmed the impossibility of calling Daniel Alves up for the period of preparation, friendlies and the World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar was forced off just minutes into Tuesday’s friendly match with Cameroon due to an apparent thigh injury]</b> He felt a discomfort on the right side of his groin region. He complained and underwent an early assessment, but he already began his treatment. It doesn’t seem serious at first, but we should wait and see how he develops.</p>
