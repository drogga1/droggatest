<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Ghana international Laryea Kingston has picked countryman Abedi Ayew ‘Pele’ as the greatest African to have ever played the beautiful game]</b> I would say <a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a> is the greatest African footballer of all-time because a lot of Africans still believe in him. They believe he’s one of the best players Africa has ever seen. In his time, he played very well and not only in Ghana. He went to France and up till today, if you go to France, especially Marseille and you mention him, he’s well known and people respect him for what he did on the field<br /><br />In Ghana too he did very well with the national team even though their time they did not qualify to be at the World Cup. At the Africa Cup <b>[of Nations]</b> and most of the games that I saw him play, even when the team is down, he lifts everyone up and makes sure the fans and everyone are happy. So he’s the greatest. For me, I think he did very well for himself and for the country</p>
