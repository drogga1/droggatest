  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star Ter Stegen hailed as ‘clearly the best’ goalkeeper in world football]</b> Well, I’m clearly leaning towards Ter Stegen. For me, he is clearly the best because he encompasses all facets of the game. He’s the most complete for my taste. He’s the most complete with the feet and with his game in all areas. His performance has been reflected in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He was very young when he arrived and has been progressing. For me, he’s the best right now<br /><br /><a href="jan-oblak.html">Oblak</a> is also in great shape, he is another great goalkeeper. They are two goalkeepers who are in the teams they have to be, they fit perfectly with their respective teams. They’re two great ones. They help all the other goalkeepers to look and improve<br /><br /><b>[A pair of Brazilians, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Alisson and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a>, have also persuaded 31-year-old Masip of their top-level qualities]</b> I also like Alisson and <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a>, the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City guys. They came in young, with a lot of desire, they are good and their performances have been reflected in the results of their teams</p>
