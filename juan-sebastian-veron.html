  <p><b>[Veron just never really fit at United.

But after December, it was very difficult for me to keep up. I would suffer from the lack of a fitness base, I wouldn’t be able to last the whole game, and I would pick up injuries</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Sebastian Veron has claimed Manchester United have struggled to move forward ever since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club]</b> Mourinho is a great manager, for me he really is. However, I think United have struggled to find the proper replacement following Ferguson’s retirement. Mourinho is a great manager, he’s doing his best at United. Maybe he is the right one, but after all Ferguson achieved at the club he is going to need some time in order to implement his idea. The departure of Ferguson had a really bad impact on them. They have not been able to find their way yet, having made a few changes already. Manchester City have found an idea in terms of football while United, following Ferguson’s departure, have struggled to do so. But they are a big club so hopefully they’ll find their <b>[football]</b> idea in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Joe Cole’s retirement from the game]</b> He was extraordinary, a fantastic player. A couple of years ago I met him here in Orlando and we talked about his career. I wish him all the best in his retirement. He was an extraordinary player</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Sebastian Veron considers the ongoing debate regarding the greatness of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> compared to <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> is unfair]</b> It is difficult, very complex. Some say <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, because he won a World Cup. Those who did not see <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> and did see <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> are going to tell you <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I think those kinds of comparisons with players that have given us so much in football seem very unfair. Such discussions lead to nothing, they are useless<br /><br /><b>[Pressed to pick out the main differences between the pair]</b> The era, the speed of football. The personalities, in a good way. Diego marked an era and today <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is marking his own with different personalities, and different ways to play football. They are undoubtedly two historic players and we are lucky that they are Argentine<br /><br /><b>[Asked how he expects that coaching stint to go]</b> In football, anything can happen. Undoubtedly <b>[his arrival]</b> generated great enthusiasm. Enthusiasm helps to diffuse many football differences. Then it will depend on the talent of his coaches, his talent and what he can generate on the field<br /><br /><b>[Veron worked under some iconic bosses in his playing days but does not consider former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to have been the pick]</b> I didn’t pay much attention to the tactical details. In reality, I played, I paid attention, I knew what was being said - because obviously you are obviously within a group - but I always paid a lot of attention to team management, always. For me, the best at that who I worked with was <a href="sven-goran-eriksson.html">Sven-Goran Eriksson</a>. I hardly ever experienced any kind of problems in his teams. And they were groups with strong personalities. He got on with everyone very well and ultimately that made us win, especially at Lazio</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Sebastian Veron admits <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> could never have imagined that they would fall so far behind arch-rivals <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> Never. That begins to change with the arrival of entrepreneurs… with the arrival of Roman Abramovich. Just when I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it was the first year he was there. No one imagined that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> could become what it is today<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on the possible reasons for United’s regression]</b> When you have one person who is in charge for 25 years, the adaptation takes time. Also, the club went private. And then a whole generation that marked an era of that United team, with clear rules, with clear conditions have gone. Before you had a group that each knew their role, off the field, that was an incredible generation of players, a well-formed group. That is very, very difficult to build. The club didn’t manage to do a smooth transition. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is suffering and trying to rebuild<br /><br /><b>[Veron said of the 1999 Treble winner]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is there to build, to rebuild as someone who was at the club, who was part of that group. He was also part of Ferguson’s coaching staff, with <a href="mike-phelan.html">Mike Phelan</a> and his former team-mates. They will have to work hard to get back to how they were. Ole seems to me a coach, a manager who knows the club. He a good person, a very good person and hopefully it goes well. It will not be simple, it will not be easy</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Inter Midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron discussed how the Coronavirus emergency is unfolding in his native country]</b> It’s been a week since football has been stopped and the situation is becoming a bit heavy in our country. The government has set restrictions, we have to stay at home. As for the club, I feel for the guys, trying to understand how they are. As a club we have provided the infrastructure that we have in case the situation becomes more difficult<br /><br /><b>[The 45-year-old Argentinian then discussed current <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> players that have similar qualities to the ones he possessed]</b> Sensi and Luis Alberto look like me. Maybe Sensi has some of my characteristics. When I moved to Italy, they let me do little, because coming from Argentina the tactical part wasn’t my forte. In this sense Eriksson was the coach who understood me the most, with him I expressed myself at my best, he gave me complete freedom. Another player I like a lot is Luis Alberto, he is having a great season and he has some characteristics in which I see myself again<br /><br /><b>[He revealed why he wore the famous knee bandage for so long in his career]</b> The sash I wore on my knee? It started at <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>, with a dear friend who was also at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and Inter, Sergio Viganò, a masseur. At the time I had a small problem with my knee and out of habit I wore it until the end of my career<br /><br /><b>[Veron spoke about Inter forward <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a>]</b> They are different players. <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is a player who can not only play as a second striker, but also as a trequartista. I don’t think Lautaro can do that, but inside the area he’s a player who is unlikely to make a mistake in front of the goal. They can play together, they’re young, they have a lot of years to improve everything they’ve shown over the years</p>
