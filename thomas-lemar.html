  <p><b>[Arsenal and Liverpool target Thomas Lemar underlined his commitment to Monaco after a stunning performance for France on Thursday]</b> We’ll see what happens, but for the moment I’m at Monaco, and I’m very happy over there.</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Lemar is admitting after the win that the speculation surrounding his future did not affect him]</b> I am a player of Monaco, I am very happy there. Now I’m going to make a good season with my club, to try to progress and move forward in my career with Monaco. I prepared for this game as usual. I do not lose my head, even if there are rumours. I was focused on my game, that’s all that mattered to me</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Lemar says he will play anywhere for France as Les Bleus set off on their quest for World Cup glory]</b> Frankly, it doesn’t matter. Whether that’s on the left or in the centre, I’ll adapt according to the system and the game plan of the coach. I grew up playing in the middle but then, as I said, at professional level you have to adapt.<br /><br /><b>[Who would we want to]</b> Avoid? I don’t know. If we pass the group stages, all teams will be complicated and hard to beat. We will try to go as far as possible<br /><br /><b>[If Lemar possessed a magic wand that could eliminate one team from the competition]</b> They are strong collectively and individually, they’re a very beautiful team.<br /><br />You can’t feel pressure. We know our qualities. As I said, it’s up to us to balance things out and focus to go as far as possible</p>
