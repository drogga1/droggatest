  <p><b>[Sammy McIlroy says <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> could be the ideal choice to captain <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the future]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> has been absolutely unbelievable. When he first came in I was thinking maybe he could be a squad player, maybe we’d need him in certain games, but the boy has taken it by the scruff of the neck and been our best midfield player this season. He was magnificent against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> the other day. He battles, he works, he’s a box to box midfielder and he’s tough in the challenge. He’s been superb. He could maybe be club captain in the future. I think <b>[Harry]</b> Maguire will be the next captain, but I think midfield players make good captains because they’re involved with everything. <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> is a Scottish international now, he’s growing in confidence and maybe down the line he could be an ideal choice</p>

  <p><b>[Sammy McIlroy says <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> has the potential to be an unbelievable addition for Manchester United]</b> We need a bit of experience. The boy <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is capable of being absolutely unbelievable. This season he doesn’t look half the player, but he’s the kind of midfield player United should be after. I’d take him, Maddison, or <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> - something is needed in there, and we need a proven striker too!<br /><br />Ole has stated that if someone who will definitely improve the squad, the club will act. But there’s no point getting someone in just for the sake of it. But who do you get? Who do you bring in? We’ve got <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> out injured, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> injured too. It’s all well and good saying we need to go out there and spend, but who is going to move club in January?<br /><br />Ole’s future is a huge question. If you look at the other <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> managers – <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> - they’ve all won trophies. Ole hasn’t. But he did play for the club and he understands the fans. I’m not too sure we’re going to get top four, and I’m not too sure he’s still going to be there</p>

  <p><b>[Sammy McIlroy says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> need to be adding more flair to their squad in the next transfer window]</b> At <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> you always need flair players and I’m sure Ole knows that, he was in the squad under the great <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, scoring goals for fun. Competition for places in squads is a great thing and I think Ole is trying to build that now, United had that under Sir Matt <b>[Busby]</b> and Sir Alex, you need competition and I think Ole is getting that.<br /><br />It’s great when you see this season some of the academy players coming through, there have been times when we’ve had six or seven academy players in the squad. It’s always been the club’s philosophy, we had the <a href="matt-busby.html">Busby</a> Babes, to see young players now coming through the ranks and playing for the team is great</p>
