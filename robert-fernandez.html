  <p><b>[Barcelona could welcome a couple of familiar faces back to Camp Nou this summer, with club director Robert Fernandez admitting to tracking Gerard Deulofeu and Hector Bellerin]</b> We have the possibility and that is good, we have the possibility to do it and I am very happy of what is happening. He was at Everton and wasn’t playing. He made the transfer to Milan, is playing and has been called up for the national team. We will wait for events. It is good news to have the possibility. I think it’s €12m to recover him.<br /><br /><b>[Bellerin is tied to a long-term contract at Emirates]</b> He is a good player and he is playing very well at Arsenal. He is young and very interesting</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona technical secretary Robert Fernandez has insisted that the club are still working on a deal for Philippe Coutinho but has ruled out signing Jean Seri]</b> We are negotiating with some players about the possibility of incorporating them into the team and we hope to reach an agreement to introduce a new player. We have been working for a long time on possibilities, maybe a player comes or maybe there are two, we have to wait because we are negotiating and we can find ourselves with a favourable framework to bring one more, or maybe two.<br /><br />Everyone knows what situation the market is in and what has happened, the teams know what our situation is but the fact that we have moved quickly helps us to reach a favourable situation. But without a <b>[release]</b> clause we are forced to into long and tense negotiations and there are times we could not go further. Uneasiness can exist but we know very well what we want and we will wait until the last moment. My intention is for another player to arrive, two if possible<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the potential of Angel Di Maria joining from PSG]</b> I will not go into naming but I admit that the club is working on the possibility of bringing in new players.<br /><br />We hope to present another player this month. Seri is totally ruled out</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool demanded €200 million for Philippe Coutinho when Barcelona made a deadline day bid to sign the Brazil forward]</b> Liverpool were asking for €200m so logically we didn’t accept that. We thank the player, he made a big effort to come here and showed that he wanted to play for us, but the situation ended the way it did and there was nothing else we could do.<br /><br />Barcelona have an excellent team and the signings are going to contribute a lot. We have been planning the transfers for a long time. We have chosen high level players that will help us. We have a very good team, the team will help us compete. Last night we worked on the possibility of doing some deals and it was not possible. We have to work and look for solutions. We have to think about the future. I personally talked to <b>[PSG head coach Unai]</b> Emery and he knows very well that Verratti is the player we wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Lenglet convinced Barcelona long before Man Utd display]</b> We had been following him since he played at Nancy. After seeing him improve at Sevilla it just confirmed that he could be an important player for us. There was a certain obsession with Barcelona’s central defenders at the time. There was a feeling that a lot of money had been spent and the players who had joined just didn’t work out.<br /><br />For me it was important that the new centre-back was a calm but fun guy, good with the ball and young - that was fundamental - but above all we were looking for someone who was very responsible and professional. In those two games against Man United, despite being very good individually, he didn’t convince me there because marking <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku is not particularly difficult. Lukaku is not one of the top strikers at the moment. He’s a good, strong forward and Lenglet marked him one-on-one with ease, but we prioritised other things. The guy’s blood is ice cold in situations where others would be having palpitations. He’s an exceptional player in that respect because he knows when to put on the breaks and be calm in tense situations. That’s just the kind of player that Barcelona needs, someone capable of making clear decisions in nervy situations. We had very few doubts about his signing <b>[even before the Manchester United matches]</b>.<br /><br />Lenglet’s football will evolve and he will be a much better player next season if he maintains the right mental attitude. He has all the right conditions to do that because he is surrounded by players who will help improve every facet of his game. There is not a single player that has played for Barcelona that hasn’t improved once they’ve left. Everyone progresses even if they don’t play much and that’s not the case for Lenglet</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho was taken to Barcelona to become the next Andres Iniesta]</b> It’s important to find the right position for him. It’s clear he’s suffered a lot in recent matches, you can see it in his face and in his body language. It isn’t easy playing for Barcelona, although Coutinho is a great footballer.<br /><br />I believe he’d do better in midfield. His arrival was a personal decision of mine because I felt he could replace Iniesta. Well, as much as anyone can because Iniesta is irreplaceable<br /><br />We are in a defining moment and it is not time to criticise anyone. It is time to make everything happen as we talked at the beginning of the season. It is ugly to see a team-mate get booed like that, we must all be together and support. What Philippe needs right now is help. The gesture from Messi was priceless</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> technical director Robert Fernandez says it would be a mistake for <a href="arthur-melo.html">Arthur Melo</a> to leave the club amid links to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I don’t think Arthur is leaving. We are going through a particular moment where a lot of news is not checked well enough. I sincerely think it would be a mistake if he is sold because he is a young player. When we signed him we paid a large amount due to his qualities, age and projection. We thought he was going to have big growth at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and now I think he deserves a better status. His first season was good but, after that, he hasn’t been driven towards favourable situations. In addition, he suffered some small injuries which probably made it harder to have continuity in the starting line-up but we are still speaking about a player with huge individual skill, with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> DNA even if he didn’t grow in La Masia. He is a player who has everything to become an important player<br /><br /><b>[Fernandez says that the midfielder is in need of more continuity]</b> He must find the coach able to bring out the football he has inside. He did great with <a href="fede-valverde.html">Valverde</a> in his first season, the coach found the ideal role for him next to <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> but he hasn’t had continuity in this season. The first season is used to be the adaptation one and he did great. He played very well at a high level and we were all delighted with him. I can’t understand discussing a player who not long ago made you happy. I think when something was working and is now not at his best, it is important to keep the same perception and style. If he played well in the first season, why didn’t he reach that level in the second one? I’ve seen he doesn’t finish the games and this is a big mistake, it brings you to an uncomfortable situation. You can think about a player that he is not in a good physical rhythm but to increase it, you must make him suffer and to play 90 minutes. I hope he gets brought in more in the next season and he can become the important player he must be because he has an extraordinary quality and pure FCB DNA<br /><br /><b>[Fernandez hopes that the midfielder looks to <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Ivan Rakitic</a> as an example on how to deal with exit reports]</b> I hope it doesn’t affect Arthur. The people around him should help him to remember the important things in life, as <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Rakitic</a> did last season. Ivan is a player with a great personality and is used to playing in very difficult situations but nobody likes to read in the newspapers the club is thinking of selling you. It is not easy at all for a player in such a situation and such an experience. Players must be protected so it would be good if these things could be quickly denied because it is not good for them. It can only make the player angry and to lower his concentration and performances</p>

  <p><b>[former club technical director Robert Fernandez says I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> should never leave]</b> Watching this <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team, you need fast forward players, able to unbalance the opponents; passing and passing the ball is good but you need the capacity to unbalance because it’s impossible to win games by only passing the ball. I think <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, Arthur, De Jong, <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Rakitic</a> are important - and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, I think he should never leave. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is different to the rest, possession and good treatment of the ball are required and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> has an extraordinary quality. He scores often, so I never understood why he was loaned, it is only about finding his position on the pitch. Maybe something could be done better with him or perhaps the player found himself in a bad situation. I think some players need patience because they are the ones who win games. We can’t discuss a player like him, able to unbalance, who works harder, who scores often and he never complains. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> can’t be allowing these players to leave because these are the ones who make <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> fans jump out of their seats. I can’t speak about financial reasons but on the pitch <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is a great professional, he loves to work, but for players at this level when they are on the bench they can lose their course and this is not good for the club nor the player. He is such a very special player. If it was my decision, <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> would never had left</p>
