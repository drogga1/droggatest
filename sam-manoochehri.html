  <p><b>[Sam Manoochehri says <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a>’s teenage superstar Jude Bellingham is destined for a future at the very top of the game]</b> I’ve got no doubt in my mind that Jude will play in the Champions League and he will represent England at senior level. <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, it might be a nice fit for Jude, with a rejuvenated team, and talk of <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> going over there. But <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> would also suit. The recent profile of players that have come through that system, the likes of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>. Jude would fit that mould, too. And look at what’s going on at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> now. A lot of good young players in that team<br /><br />Anywhere Jude goes, he will be a success, based purely on his mentality. I have never seen a mentality more elite than this. When I worked with him, when something was tough, he loved it. I can remember games when he wanted to play centre-half to test himself. Now if you say to most young midfielders or attackers, ‘by the way you’re playing centre-half today’, they probably wouldn’t be best pleased with it. But Jude would actively go and seek the challenge without having to be pushed from the coaching staff. All we did was provide an environment in which he could go and stretch himself. I can remember one training session in particular where after about 20 minutes, I asked him: ‘are you using your other foot?’. He replied: ‘Yeah, I am just going to play on my left foot today’ and that was without any prompts. That is his unique ability. He loves a challenge, loves developing and learning, and being pushed out of his comfort zone<br /><br />Jude has got to make sure that his next move is to a club where he plays. If not, I don’t think there is any problem with him staying at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>. He’s got to where he is at the minute by coming through the whole <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> program, so there should be no rush to move on. But look at the England team now. Look at the last World Cup: where did they all come from? A lot of them came from the Championship. Other than <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, or <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, the rest of the team started at lower league clubs. Harry Maquire was at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> at Barnsley, <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>, from MK Dons, <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a> came from Sunderland, to name a few. They were all given an opportunity to be a regular in the first team before moving onto bigger and better things</p>
