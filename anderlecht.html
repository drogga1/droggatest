<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany and Anderlecht set for training sessions after Pro League cancellation]</b> Players who do not feel reassured can continue to work at home. But each player present at Neerpede will observe the safety distances and the coaches will direct the exercises while respecting the social distance<br /><br />It will be mainly physical training, but also with a ball. All the equipment used will be disinfected, before and after each session. Players will not have access to the dressing room, everyone will change and shower at home</p>
