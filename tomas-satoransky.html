  <p><b>[NBA star Tomas Satoransky has heaped praise on Petr Cech]</b> It’s sad for football that he is retiring. It’s sad for football in our country <b>[Czech Republic]</b> and in general. He has had such a big influence on all goalkeepers around the world. He was one of the best, for sure, when he was at Chelsea. I’m not saying it just because I am from his country but just the way he played at Chelsea and the way he was dominating the game over many years. He has played at a high level for a lot of years. I think he is one of the greatest in history.<br /><br />It’s sad for us Czechs. There is a lot of people in the Czech Republic who look up to him and I was one of them. Not just his soccer, obviously everyone knows his skills - he has the most clean sheets in Premier League history. But he was so smart, too. Just the way he talked, the way he handled the media. I was always so amazed how he was outside with the media. I think he has been a great role model for everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[NBA star Tomas Satoransky has labelled LeBron James as the Cristiano Ronaldo of basketball and compared Kobe Bryant to Lionel Messi]</b> Am I Team Messi or Team Ronaldo? I’m Team Messi! If I had to name a ‘Messi of basketball’, it would be <b>[former LA Lakers star]</b> Kobe Bryant. I would probably call LeBron James more like a Cristiano Ronaldo because of how physically dominant he is. But I would say Messi is more like a Kobe Bryant.<br /><br />We shared the same training centre with the football team but they were always quite hidden from us and from the media. I remember the fans waiting for the Barcelona soccer players. We <b>[the basketball players]</b> would come along and the fans would be like: ‘We don’t want them!’ So they were waiting only for the soccer players. But it was like a real family there at Barcelona. Neymar and Pique are huge basketball fans. Pique was at a couple of games, too<br /><br />I always pay attention to footballers who come over from Europe and I followed the career of Wayne Rooney when he was in the Premier League, before he came to Washington. It’s great for MLS and American soccer fans that they get to watch players like Rooney. It’s become more and more fashionable for such stars since David Beckham played for the LA Galaxy.<br /><br /><b>[To help basketball grow]</b> is why we have had an NBA game in London for so many years in a row. They love basketball in the UK and their league is developing well. The UK fans are great and when you see all the stars from the Premier League sitting courtside for the game, it’s clear it has a big impact. A lot of my friends from Europe are trying to come over to watch the game, too</p>
