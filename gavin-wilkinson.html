  <p><b>[The Portland Timbers have signed Argentine winger Sebastian Blanco as a designated player]</b> Sebastian Blanco is a talented player we have been aware of and tracked for quite some time. To say the process of acquiring him was complex is an understatement, and we are delighted to confirm the transfer and that he wanted Portland to be his new home.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers GM explains why he didn’t sign Freddy Adu]</b> It isn’t easy getting into our squad when you look at players like <b>[Darlington]</b> Nagbe, <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri, <b>[Fanendo]</b> Adi, <b>[Darren]</b> Mattocks and <b>[Sebastian]</b> Blanco. It was always going to be tough for Freddy, however we felt he deserved the opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers have signed former Paris Saint-Germain defender Larrys Mabiala]</b> We are pleased to acquire a player of Larrys’ quality and experience, and we are excited that he has chosen to join the Portland Timbers. This has been a positional need since losing Gbenga Arokoyo to an injury and while it took longer than we would have liked, we are delighted to add a proven central defender with the right profile to help the team.</p>

  <p><b>[The Portland Timbers have announced the signing of Argentina youth international Tomas Conechny on loan from Superliga Argentina club San Lorenzo]</b> We are pleased to announce the addition of Tomas Conechny to our group during this summer transfer window. He is a player we have been following closely, and we believe he has a bright future ahead of him as a player who can play any of the attacking positions. We have been looking to add a young, talented dynamic player and feel that, in Tomas, we have a player who can help contribute short term, while also giving us a long-term solution in several positions. The opportunity to bring him to Portland was a unique one, and the fact he had already been watched live many times made this possible when we had to move quickly to acquire him.</p>

  <p><b>[FC Cincinnati has announced the acquisition of striker Fanendo Adi from the Portland Timbers in exchange for $450,000 in general allocation money and $400,000 in targeted allocation money]</b> Adi’s place in Timbers history is firmly entrenched, as one of the top goal-scorers across all eras of the club and for his considerable efforts in helping lead Portland to its first MLS Cup in 2015.</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Savarese poised to cap smooth transition to MLS with another title]</b> He knew he was coming in with a group that was successful, so he didn’t come in talking about trying to revolutionize the Timbers, but he did come in and help us establish an identity that could help us win. It took a coach with the self confidence, someone very secure, to come in and not try to change things overnight. He took his time establishing putting his own stamp on the team and you can see it now.</p>

  <p><b>[Gavin Wilkinson on bold moves that strengthen the team]</b> Coming into the offseason we knew we would have to make several bold moves that strengthen the team with the objective of getting back to the NWSL final. Acquiring the first pick in the draft was essential for us and we believe the player we select will not only help in the short term, but will be someone that will grow with the club and become a fixture in this team for years to come</p>
