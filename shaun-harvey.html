<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former English Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey has said he wanted to hold the Carabao Cup draw in outer space, and even held talks with the International Space Station]</b> Genuinely, we opened up discussions with the International Space Station.<br /><br /><b>[Harvey’s plan did not come into effect, and he believes that after Bury’s expulsion, the time has come to again reconsider the Owners’ Conduct Review]</b> I don’t think anybody would argue that Bury wouldn’t have warranted it<br /><br /><b>[The EFL was criticised for allowing the sale of Bury to <a href="steve-dale.html">Steve Dale</a> in the first place, but Harvey said that it’s not easy for the organisation to prevent sales]</b> The majority of the sales are forced and they need to happen for the long-term survival of that club. And if the eligibility test is too severe, you could actually bring about the finishing of the club - which is the very thing that you’re looking to try to avoid<br /><br /><b>[Though the Owners’ Conduct Review was not instituted by the EFL, Harvey still insists that Bury’s demise was an outcome of the club’s own making]</b> People will blame you because they need somebody to blame. But the problem at Bury wasn’t created by the league, wasn’t created by the regulations. It was created by a period of overspending and the club not having the money to meet the financial commitments that it made</p>
