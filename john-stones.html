  <p><b>[John Stones says he is ‘addicted to silverware’ as he looks to follow up his treble success at Manchester City with UEFA Nations League glory for England]</b> The chance we’ve got is so new: a new tournament that we can go and win. There’s boys here who have not won or been in any finals and <b>[have not experienced]</b> what it’s like to win something or fight for something so special. And I want to give them that hunger of something so special, so addictive. When you lift a trophy and know that you’ve been the best in whatever competition, it is something so special.<br /><br />I can’t describe it in any other way. It’s so addictive. To have that memory in your head. When I think back now of lifting that <b>[FA Cup]</b> trophy at Wembley up on the balcony, it’s something that will never leave your mind. It’s so unique when you can’t have anyone say they were better than you. <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> is always making fun of me and he’ll send me a picture of the three things he’s won; the World Cup and two Euros <b>[saying]</b> ‘This might be you one day.’ That’s something that he’s so proud of. I don’t want to say that I can’t imagine it. I couldn’t imagine it years ago happening but now we’re so close to something special, I can’t imagine what the scenes would be like if we do it. And touch wood we do, because it would be something special for all of us, even you guys sat here.<br /><br /><b>[Previous England sides have seen those club rivalries cause splits at international level]</b> It <b>[team spirit]</b> will fall back into place. I think when you look at it when we’ve had the rivalry all season, as soon as the game is done we’ve seen it with many players, the game’s done and that’s it done. It’s something you can’t hold on to. Obviously with the Spurs and Liverpool boys it will be a different scenario. I don’t think they’re selfish enough to hold something against another player or one that plays for a different team when we’re coming together to fight for something. I know players who in the past would have done that, where they’re held a bit of a grudge or held that emotion of something that hurt. It’s a quick turnaround for those boys. It will still be raw for a lot of them. But I’m really positive they’ll come in the right frame of mind</p>

The <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> went down 3-1 to the Dutch in extra-time of the UEFA Nations League semi-final. John Stones in particular was heavily criticised following his mistake which led to Kyle Walker’s 97th-minute own-goal, but manager Gareth Southgate has also come out in support of the Manchester City defender</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones is looking to fill the big boots of Vincent Kompany and prove himself worthy of an extended stay at Manchester City]</b> There’s some big shoes to fill - Vinnie set a benchmark at the club which I don’t think can be done again. He’s such a good person and for anyone who becomes captain, if they do half the job he did then they will be able to call themselves successful. He was such a key player for us, and will be missed by everyone, especially me personally. But it’s a great challenge for me and us all to step up and grab the bull by the horns and run with it now<br /><br /><b>[Stones has struggled for consistency throughout his time at City and admits to having endured a tough end to the 2018-19 campaign]</b> It was a difficult last two months of the season and the England game was a difficult night for me personally. I let a lot of people down - the manager, players and nation and put my hands up and it’s something I have to live with. But I’ll come back fighting stronger and I’m not one to give up easily on something. I love the club <b>[City]</b> and everyone here and want to be the best player I can and striving to be where I want to be. If I keep working hard every day to improve like I am then I will hopefully get there</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones says he is ready to fight for his place at Manchester City after falling out of favour last term]</b> I took some time away in my holidays and reflected. I’ve come back this season fighting for my chance to play again and put that right. I’m sure I will because I’ve got that strong mindset of putting things right and being honest when you’ve done something wrong. The last two months were frustrating, but any player not playing is frustrated. You have to respect the manager. I wanted to come on and try to affect any game that I could when I came on, however many minutes I got. It’s about the team and not about John Stones or whoever else. That’s why we won four trophies last season<br /><br /><b>[Man City have added Rodri to a squad packed with talent and Stones is looking forward to the action starting again]</b> It’s always non-stop. It’s good to see new faces and obviously the club are wanting to move in the right direction, signing young players. We’ve got quite a young squad now. We’ve still got players to come back from the Copa America and <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a> from winning the Africa Cup of Nations. The full squad is not back yet while we’re out on pre-season. That’s something we’ve got to manage, with the new players coming and trying to settle and then more players coming back, trying to get to know them and how they play. It’s an exciting time for us.</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones admits <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> feel flat after dropping two points at Newcastle]</b> That result is hard to take. The dressing room is really flat. Everything happened so quickly in the last 10 minutes from elation to deflation. It’s a difficult one to take. They set up defensively right from the off. We conceded two sloppy goals today and that has cost us today. The chase is still on. We fight until the last day. That’s what we did last season. Anything can happen. Today we played some unbelievable play but those mistakes cost us</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones admits it’s difficult to explain Manchester City’s defensive problems]</b> To concede the goals we did was very frustrating, especially the late one. When Kevin’s strike had gone in, we thought: ‘we have to control the game now and see the game out’. We just didn’t do that and it’s something hard to explain at the minute. Everyone in the dressing room is disappointed. If we had a magic wand and could put our finger on what it is, it would be great. We have to improve on it quite quickly<br /><br />We need every City fan to believe in us. They are entitled to their own opinion, that’s what football is about, but they want to win it as much as we do. There are tough games ahead but the schedule is nothing we can control. We will train for two days before the next game but we have to get back to winning ways and put that pressure on ourselves. We fought right until the end at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. I don’t want to cloud anyone’s opinion about how we played, but I thought it was so good at times. It was just a few key moments that cost us the points. I don’t want to put a massive negative on the game, which is easy to do when it was in our hands so late on. We just need to switch it around quickly and hopefully can do that on Tuesday night<br /><br /><b>[Stones says they have to put together a winning streak to put the pressure on Liverpool]</b> We can come back, of course. We just have to keep fighting and concentrate on every game - next is <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> and we have to focus on that and turn it around from what happened. We have always been able to do that quite well, and I believe in everyone in that dressing room. The fight is on until the last day. We have to think positive and dream big. We did it from nine points last season and don’t see why it can’t be done again</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones laughs off ‘sniper’ jibes &amp; remains unfazed by criticism of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> form]</b> Literally everyone is different, so some might take it to heart, it might affect some more than others. I’ve got to try and turn it into a positive and let that negative press or whatever it might be motivate me to come back better and stronger. Take for instance the Carabao Cup final. The ball’s gone up in the air and I’m backtracking, but as I’m looking up in the air, all I could see - and you’ll know when you kick the ball up in the air and it’s just blue sky - it’s coming down and you don’t know where it’s going to land. I just got disorientated. The next minute I’m on the floor and thinking ‘oh, no, just get up, get back into it.’ But it could have gone two ways, I could have crumbled and not done anything and let it affect me. But then I thought my character and performance after that was something I should be proud of. How I reacted and helped the team, especially in the last 10 minutes<br /><br />You’ve got to come through those situations to know what to do. Those things go unrecognised but not to your team-mates. Everyone saw the mistake, which happens. Everyone was saying I got snipered after!</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> remain best team]</b> For me personally, coming into the game was exciting and challenging. Even though <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been won we are still fighting for trophies. We are quietly confident we are (still the best). We know our ability and the standard we have set for ourselves in the dressing room. Playing at this high standard every three or four days is something to be very proud of. That’s what we keep striving to do. We want to finish this season off and take it into next season, keeping our standards and trying to better ourselves - defensively and taking our chances<br /><br />I picked up an injury really early after we came back and that kept me out for over a month. That was frustrating after the lockdown period when I’d worked so hard, kept myself fit and felt like I was in the best condition I’ve been in. So it feels great to be back. I feel fit and healthy, ready to fight for the Champions League and every competition we are in. They are exciting times</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones admits he’s had a ‘frustrating’ time at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> lately]</b> I’m really frustrated with conceding that goal at the end. It’s just an accumulation of things that happened in the game. Towards the end I felt we got a bit sloppy in our possession, and it’s led to them scoring. It’s probably a bit raw right now, obviously we’ve won, and it’s good to get another win on the bounce. But from a personal point of view I’m frustrated we’ve conceded. We defended so well through the game, and they made it really difficult for us today.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his season]</b> Really frustrating from a personal perspective. Injury re-occurrence, then little things like getting injured a few days in after lockdown. It’s been frustrating. I’ve tried to stay positive, and be ready when I’m called upon, and I feel I have been. Coming back after lockdown, getting fit again, and then coming back in and playing against some tough opponents. So I feel fit, feel ready to fight for <a href="fa.html">the FA Cup</a> at the weekend, and then the Champions League. I feel I’m on the right track. It’s good to be getting that consistency of playing and keeping my fitness</p>
