  <p><b>[John Stones admits he is enduring a difficult time at Manchester City after slipping out of favour under Pep Guardiola]</b> It’s difficult. Every player wants to play week-in, week-out. But I’ve had games here and there, I’ve been fighting and that’s all you can do. Train hard, keep working hard and when your chance comes you’ve got to take it and that’s what I’ve done. Stayed positive. I’ve had the players’ backing and the manager’s <b>[Guardiola’s]</b> backing. It’s one of those things where the team’s winning games and playing well, and you can’t get back in just like that. I’ve got to keep working hard and that’s what I’ve been doing. Still learning while I’m on the sidelines, that’s a massive thing. You can’t switch off and when your chance comes you’re ready to take it.<br /><br />I’ve got to do my job at City and, as I said, I’ve got to take my chance when it comes and Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b> is watching so much football. He’s picked me this time and I’ve just got to take my chance when I get out on the pitch. Hopefully again on Tuesday we can go again</p>

  <p><b>[Behind Pep Guardiola’s role as World Cup kingmaker]</b> I think we try to bring all the attributes and what we learn under Pep into the England squad, and are open to learn from Gareth as well. We work hard on the training pitch under Pep, learn a lot of things, different styles of play, how to play against different formations. I think it gives you that head start coming into England, and we can share our ideas as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City will be chasing the extra bonus of securing the Premier League title on derby day against arch-rivals Manchester United]</b> It would mean a lot. If it was the other way round, I am sure they would say the same. You do not want it to happen, it is the bragging rights of the city, and I knew that from derbies I had played in Liverpool. It is the game you do not want to lose and we are not treating it any differently or overlooking things too much. We know the job that is in front of us, it is a massive game and a massive derby and we have to win. For the city, for our fans, for everyone, I am sure it will mean a lot more beating United to <b>[win]</b> the title, it is that extra bonus for people to say. But we are treating it as another game and a derby is as derby games are.<br /><br />The term ‘dream come true’ sums it up really. I never thought as a kid I would be challenging for the title, or within touching distance. It is hard to say as until you get it in your hands, you do not know how it is going to feel. We still have games if things do not go well, but we want to win it on Saturday if possible. It is iconic around the world and in my opinion, the most difficult league in the world, so everyone watches it and to play in it, be able to fight for it and hopefully lift it, is something I am very proud of and hopefully I can do</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City John Stones was not surprised by the dominance his team have shown]</b> Surprised? Maybe not, because it’s how we have played and we played like that last season. We had a month last season where it stalled and we didn’t kick on, but before that we were so dominant. We wanted to build on that from last season and be the dominant side we have been; on the ball and scoring goals.<br /><br />We can’t say it’s done now with the records that we have already broken. I’ve seen it before, when a team wins the league early and they take their foot off the gas and we definitely don’t want to do that. We want to stay true to ourselves; make everybody proud and keep winning, that hunger and fight will still be there until the last minute<br /><br />As an England fan as well, I want to do the nation proud. We want to try and silence the past. There’s been a lot of negativity surrounding England when we get to tournaments. We want people to enjoy watching England again and dream that we can go and do something big at the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones admits Colombia are the dirtiest team he has ever faced]</b> The game was so strange. Probably the dirtiest team I have ever come up against. In the respect of when we won a penalty - they were surrounding the referee, even pushing the referee. The headbutt I’m sure you’ve all seen. Scuffing the penalty spot. A lot of off the ball stuff that I’m sure you have not heard about. All the sort of things you don’t really hear in a football match. On our behalf, it showed massive character to keep a cool head and not get sucked into their game. When you play a team that want to fight and disturb your momentum, you can sometimes get dragged into it. That’s what they want. We stuck to our plan and kept playing our way of football. It’s a great sign for a team to have that sort of quality, to have tunnel vision of what we want out of the game plan. It was a difficult situation to be in, but one we overcame and can be proud of.</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones is bidding to become the best in the world]</b> For me, he’s <b>[Guardiola]</b> the best manager in the world and the trust he has had in me has brought me on so much. It’s the best place for me to be in my career. I know he’s got all our backs in the dressing room as we would with him and I think that’s why we’re so strong and such a collective. Everyone fights for each other on and off the pitch and we keep improving because he invests so much time into each individual. He puts pressure on us to improve and he’s seen the results. I 100 per cent want to be one of the best in the world, but I know it will take time and hard work on and off the pitch. I don’t think I will be in the team every week because I don’t think anyone can. The amount of games are so demanding. But to be in the majority is something I strive for, I want to keep improving and striving to better myself and beat the targets we set last season.<br /><br />I know when there’s a time to play and not to play and I’ve learned the hard way a few times, but it’s stood me in good stead. I’m not afraid or shy of putting it into Row Z, but it’s great to have a manager’s backing on those things</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones has talked up the strength of the Premier League]</b> I believe it’s the strongest league in the world by far. Every team in the Premier League is so strong, no matter where they are in the table. You’ve seen last season where West Brom were having troubles, a new manager <b>[Darren Moore]</b> came in, they went to Old Trafford, beat United and we won the league off of that. I think that shows that any team can beat anyone and not only the top five, top six is strong. At any given moment or time, anything can happen in football, but the depth in the league is good. I think it’s good because no one ever takes their foot off the gas, especially against the top teams.<br /><br />{On Manchester United, relinquishing a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2]&lt;/b&gt; It was a really difficult week. We had a chance to win the league and getting knocked out of the Champions League after the display that we put on at the Etihad, there were a lot of emotions running about to be honest. There were a lot of thoughts, a lot quieter in the dressing room, as expected really</p>

  <p><b>[John Stones admits he would pay a lot of money to watch silky Manchester City team-mate David Silva in action]</b> David Silva. 100 per cent. I’d pay a lot of money to watch him play for the rest of his life. Some of the stuff he does, how he moves with the ball and the appreciation when he takes its first touch, he’s just a silky player. If you could watch him in training as well and how he is and his whole demeanour, how he is as a person - it excels him and how much you like him..<br /><br />Playing against Messi was an experience. I obviously watched him growing up as a kid and being a massive fan it was great to get to play against him. Some of the touches, I think you get into a danger zone with him where you think anything can happen, can come out of anywhere and score a goal. Messi, where he’s getting closer to the box and you’re running back to your own goal, you never know what could happen</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City centre-back John Stones ‘hungrier to keep winning’ in tight Premier League race]</b> It’s a different scenario, last season the league was done by now. It’s a strange situation because some of us haven’t been in this situation before. I think Vinny <b>[Vincent Kompany]</b> said that these are the times when it brings the best out of you as a player. Him as a player, David <b>[Silva]</b>, Sergio <b>[Aguero]</b> and a few of the others have been in this situation before. So they know what the feeling is and how to get the best out of it. It’s making us hungrier to keep winning, keep the pressure on and keep fighting until we can’t anymore<br /><br />I never thought I’d win one title so I think it’s extra special for me if we can do the double as it hasn’t been done for years<br /><br />How Raheem has handled himself this season, he has overcome a lot of things - some non-football related. That’s been something. How he has stood up for his beliefs and still gone out and performed the way he has… that’s admirable for me, as a friend, but I also admire him for going out and scoring the goals he has. I’m a big fan of Son Heung-min, he’s gone under the radar a bit. I voted for him. Just his performances, take nothing away from <b>[Player of the Year winner Virgil van Dijk]</b> he’s been outstanding, but I like to go for someone who’s a bit under the radar</p>

There’s boys here who have not won or been in any finals and <b>[have not experienced]</b> what it’s like to win something or fight for something so special. And I want to give them that hunger of something so special, so addictive. When you lift a trophy and know that you’ve been the best in whatever competition, it is something so special.<br /><br />I can’t describe it in any other way. It’s so addictive. To have that memory in your head. When I think back now of lifting that <b>[FA Cup]</b> trophy at Wembley up on the balcony, it’s something that will never leave your mind. It’s so unique when you can’t have anyone say they were better than you. <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> is always making fun of me and he’ll send me a picture of the three things he’s won; the World Cup and two Euros <b>[saying]</b> ‘This might be you one day.’ That’s something that he’s so proud of. I don’t want to say that I can’t imagine it. I couldn’t imagine it years ago happening but now we’re so close to something special, I can’t imagine what the scenes would be like if we do it. And touch wood we do, because it would be something special for all of us, even you guys sat here.<br /><br /><b>[Previous England sides have seen those club rivalries cause splits at international level]</b> It <b>[team spirit]</b> will fall back into place. I think when you look at it when we’ve had the rivalry all season, as soon as the game is done we’ve seen it with many players, the game’s done and that’s it done. It’s something you can’t hold on to. Obviously with the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boys it will be a different scenario. I don’t think they’re selfish enough to hold something against another player or one that plays for a different team when we’re coming together to fight for something. I know players who in the past would have done that, where they’re held a bit of a grudge or held that emotion of something that hurt. It’s a quick turnaround for those boys. It will still be raw for a lot of them. But I’m really positive they’ll come in the right frame of mind</p>

I’ve come back this season fighting for my chance to play again and put that right. I’m sure I will because I’ve got that strong mindset of putting things right and being honest when you’ve done something wrong. The last two months were frustrating, but any player not playing is frustrated. You have to respect the manager.
