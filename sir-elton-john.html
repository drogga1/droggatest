  <p><b>[Sir Elton John, who formerly owned <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, leads tributes for former England and Hornets manager Graham Taylor]</b> I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear about Graham’s passing. He was like a brother to me. We went on an incredible journey together. He took my beloved <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> from the depths of the lower leagues to uncharted territory and into Europe. We have become a leading English club because of his managerial wisdom and genius. This is a sad and dark day for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>. The club and the town. We will cherish Graham and drown our sorrows in the many brilliant memories he gave us. I love you Graham. I will miss you very much</p>

  <p><b>[Elton John talks about where his love for football came from]</b> I was six or seven. I fell in love with the whole experience. And that was it. You can’t shake your team: it’s in your blood and your bones, even when they’re completely s•••. Obviously, when they’re doing well it’s wonderful, but the other week they lost 8-0 to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. But you can’t support anyone else. <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> are my team, and I’m glad. I never thought I’d end up owner of the club, or a director, but <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> saved my life. Working with them kept me grounded when my life was going completely crazy - it reminded me of my roots, of who I really was. I’m forever grateful to them. Except when they lose 8-0. I’m not very grateful then</p>

  <p><b>[In late October, the music icon had to postpone a performance in Indianapolis due to illness]</b> To my dear fans in Indianapolis, It is with the heaviest heart that I’m forced to deliver the news that I am extremely unwell and therefore unable to perform at @TheFieldhouse tonight<br /><br />I absolutely hate to let my fans down, but I owe it to you to put on the best #EltonFarewellTour show possible and unfortunately that’s simply not possible. The date will be rearranged for March 2020, and I promise I will deliver the show you deserve. Thank you so much for your support and understanding</p>
