<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Indonesia manager Simon McMenemy, whose side have now lost all three qualifiers]</b> We have to tip our cap to a very good team. They are not just a good team, they are a very well-conditioned team. Similar things have happened for three games in a row<br /><br />It is a difficult situation. But in terms of the effort the players put into the game, every player gave everything he had in the tank - and probably a bit more.<br /><br />When you see your players give 100 per cent, you can’t complain. Mistakes do happen, especially when you are tired and fatigued from a long season</p>
