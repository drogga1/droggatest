  <p><b>[Drakkar Klose takes back comment about all English fighters being bums]</b> It was just the heat of the moment. If you look at my Twitter, me and him have been going back and forth since the fight was announced. After the fight it just got under my skin, and it came to a head, and I just let it go. My roommate right now is Bradley Scott, and he’s an English guy, and he’s fighting August 5. It was just the heat of the moment. I apologize to everyone for saying that<br /><br />I think <b>[talking is]</b> what he does to get in <b>[his]</b> opponent’s head. He intimidates them like that. I’m a different breed. I train with Benson Henderson every day. I get beat up by him. This guy, he’s not going to go in there and do that to me<br /><br /><b>[Despite winning via split decision, Klose believes he won every round and thought he dominated the fight]</b> In my head I thought I won every round. I don’t think it should have been a split decision. Marc, he has all this hype behind him. I knew that he wasn’t going to be as tough as everyone thought<br /><br />I just want to fight in Detroit. They can put me against anyone. I’ll fight <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, I’ll fight anyone. I don’t care. Just put me in there. I’ll get my hand raised</p>
