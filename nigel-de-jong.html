  <p><b>[Nigel de Jong says <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> is very happy being back in <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> and can be a real success for his hometown club]</b> Of course <b>[he can succeed]</b>, he’s back in his hometown, <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>, with his family around him. I know him very well, we speak quite often, and he’s happy. For me, it’s important for Mario to be in an environment he’s happy with and <b>[where]</b> he’s back with his family. I think he needs two more weeks before he’s really fit and he can play his first game. Mario’s Mario - the qualities will always be there. We just hope that he can pick up where he left off <b>[in France]</b> and show his qualities for <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> because they’re going to need it this year. He is very happy. So we’ll see<br /><br /><b>[The hard-nosed midfield anchor of <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>’s side believes the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a> has become an attractive destination in the eyes of top players for more reasons than money]</b> There are more players coming in and it’s due to the fact people will choose <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> now over other teams. City, back in the day, you had to come in and say, ‘Listen, here’s the contract, here’s the big money, come play for us’, instead of watching the whole culture. Now <b>[some players would]</b> rather choose <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> over <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or Madrid. That is a change, a momentum shift. United as well. I think a player would rather choose City at this moment than the other side of town. It is what it is, that’s football. It shifts. We’ll see how it goes</p>

  <p><b>[Nigel de Jong says <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> one of the greatest and scares opponents]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> gives the team so much threat. He gives them goals, obviously, but it’s just his threat. Even when walking off the ball he gives opponents fear that opens opportunities for his team-mates. He is one of the greatest strikers to play the game and I’m happy that I had the time to play with him<br /><br /><b>[De Jong left City for <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> 12 months after <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>’s arrival]</b> I had a great stint here. I had a great three years and made a lot of friends. I came out for Vincent’s <b>[Kompany]</b> testimonial game and it was great to see each other again, with the memories and the stuff we have to talk about. The team we had, especially with Micah <b>[Richards]</b>, Joleon <b>[Lescott]</b>, Vinnie <b>[Kompany]</b>, <a href="joe-hart.html">Joey Hart</a>, <a href="shaun-wright-phillips.html">Shaun Wright-Phillips</a> and <a href="stephen-ireland.html">Stephen Ireland</a>, we always had some jokers around so there are some crazy stories. The banter off the pitch between me, Micah and Joleon always stands out for me</p>
