  <p><b>[Patrick McKeown says of the Buteyko Breathing method]</b> I knew it worked for asthma and learned that it could help people with snoring, panic attacks and stress as well as helping children with dentistry issue<br /><br /><b>[Patrick, who had already self-published six books on Buteyko Breathing, mentioned that he was working on a new book on its role in sports and fitness. The agent asked him to send on what he had written and Patrick did]</b> He told me it was too technical and to write it as though I was talking to someone down in the pub, in lay language</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The blood already has enough oxygen]</b> During periods of rest the standard breathing volume for a healthy person is between 4 and 6 liters of air per minute, which results in almost complete oxygen saturation of 95 to 99 percent. Increasing oxygen saturation to 100 percent has no additional benefits<br /><br /><b>[Taking bigger breaths will do little to increase oxygen in the blood]</b> It is physiologically impossible to increase the oxygen saturation of the blood in this way, because the blood is almost always already fully saturated. It would be like pouring more water into a glass that is already filled to the brim<br /><br /><b>[Since oxygen is already saturated and breathing does little to affect it, increasing oxygen is not the key to performance, but delivery is]</b> The problem is not a lack of oxygen in the blood, but that not enough oxygen is being released from the blood to tissues and organs<br /><br /><b>[Oxygen release, from blood to tissues and organs, depends on carbon dioxide levels]</b> What determines how much of this oxygen your body <b>[muscle, organs, and tissues]</b> can use is actually the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. This says that carbon dioxide ‘is the key variable that allows the release of oxygen from the red blood cells to be metabolized by the body’ as it loosens the bond between hemoglobin and oxygen <b>[allowing delivery]</b><br /><br /><b>[We affect carbon dioxide levels by how we breathe]</b> If we are overbreathin … we exhale too much carbon dioxide, leaving our body literally gasping for oxygen<br /><br /><b>[Breathe lighter to increase carbon dioxide levels in the blood - this improves oxygenation]</b> Eliminating overbreathing is the key to harnessing the potential of the CO2 you already have inside you<br /><br /><b>[The BOLT (Body Oxygen Level Test) Score measures how much carbon dioxide we can accumulate while oxygen concentrations lower. Testing BOLT Score: After a normal exhalation, hold your breathe until you get the urge to breathe again. It is not about willpower. This length of time is your BOLT score. You should aim for 40 seconds (most people will be around 20 seconds)]</b> Ways to increase BOLT Score: 1) Stop losses of carbon dioxide, 2) Improve tolerance of carbon dioxide, and 3) Simulate high-altitude training<br /><br /><b>[We should regularly breathe through the nose, day and night]</b> True health and inner peace occurs when breathing is quiet, effortless, soft, through the nose, abdominal, rhythmic, and gently paused on the exhale. Unless you breathe calmly through your nose at night, you have no idea what it feels like to have a great night’s sleep<br /><br /><b>[Breath-hold exercises lead to preferred adaptations to oxygen and carbon dioxide]</b> They lead to both a hypoxic (lack of oxygen) and a hypercapnic (high carbon dioxide) response. The body responds with greater endurance, lower sensitivity to carbon dioxide, reduced discomfort from lactic acid buildup, etc</p>

  <p><b>[on Breathng]</b> It’s funny if you think about it. We learn about a lot of things that we don’t do, but we don’t learn about something that we do all the time: breathe</p>
