  <p><b>[Ligue 1 organisers LFP offering the Paris side their support in what could turn into a legal battle]</b> The LFP is surprised and does not understand La Liga’s refusal simply to accept the payment of the release clause of the player Neymar. The LFP asks La Liga to abide by the rules of FIFA and its responsibilities. The LFP supports Paris Saint-Germain and wishes Neymar to join the Ligue 1 championship. The LFP’s legal services are in support and at the disposal of Paris Saint-Germain, so that the contract of Neymar can be approved as soon as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Ligue de Football Professionnel, LFP, has officially condemned claims made by La Liga president Javier Tebas]</b> The LFP strongly condemns the insulting remarks made today by the president of La Liga, M. Javier Tebas, concerning PSG. These remarks are unworthy of an institution as respectable and efficient as the Spanish League. The LFP notes that only UEFA is empowered to rule of the compliance of PSG with regards FFP rules. The LFP reaffirms its support for PSG in the face of a campaign of denigration that has been going on for several weeks by some major European sides.<br /><br />At the beginning of the season, the LFP welcomes the attractiveness of Ligue 1 Conforama. The activity of the French clubs, and especially that of PSG, as helped to improve the attractiveness of Ligue 1 Conforama. Thanks to these investments, Ligue 1 Conforama has had a very good start, marked by an increase in the number of goals, as well as a clear increase in TV audiences and attendances at stadiums</p>
