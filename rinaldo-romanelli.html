<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Douglas Costa joins <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> exodus during period of coronavirus isolation in Italy]</b> The quarantine is 14 days, as stated in the Health Minister’s decree on February 21, 2020. There are no ‘discounts’ mentioned, and this was only reiterated in the following versions of the decree. As for ‘voluntary isolation,’ that is not a legal definition that appears anywhere. There is the trust of self-isolation for those who come from red zones, and quarantine with active surveillance for those who ‘had close contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases.’ The definition of ‘close contact’ given by the Health Ministry includes even a handshake or having been in the same closed space, so being in the same dressing room or training together would qualify. Therefore, <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Rugani</a>’s team-mates should’ve been put under quarantine for at least 14 days. Not up to 14 days, no reductions or alternative protocols other than for truly exceptional circumstances<br /><br />The exceptional circumstances would be military personnel returning from overseas or health workers who in an emergency situation can be rushed back if they represent no risk for themselves or others. It certainly does not apply to players. What I want to know is who authorised this? There are no laws or decrees that state someone can leave their home early from quarantine, let alone leave the country. The fact they were allowed to leave only seven-eight days after one of their team-mates tested positive, that makes it even stranger. I hope those who took this decision considered the situation carefully, including the legal ramifications</p>
