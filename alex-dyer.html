  <p><b>[Kilmarnock boss Steve Clarke would find it hard to turn down the position of Scotland manager]</b> It’s a pinnacle of anyone’s career. If the country comes for him it would be a great honour. I know he knows that. He has done a great job here. He’s always left it open that he will decide at the end of the season, that’s no secret. At the end of the day, it is a hard one to turn down. We will just leave it up to the gaffer. What will be, will be</p>

  <p><b>[Kilmarnock have confirmed Alex Dyer will lead them into the new season after signing a two-year contract as manager]</b> I’m extremely proud to continue as manager of this wonderful football club and I thank the board of directors for the faith they’ve shown me. My passion and desire to lead this club and team has been strengthened during these recent months away from football and I’m looking forward to start working with the team again as we prepare for the season ahead. I’ve always enjoyed a close bond with the fans and I’ve been blown away by how they’ve continued to show their support during the shutdown. This season, starting out without supporters in the stadium, will be unlike any other that I’ve ever known but that continued sense of unity can help carry us through until we’re able to reunite at Rugby Park</p>

  <p><b>[Kilmarnock boss Alex Dyer says he had to work harder in coaching because he’s black]</b> I’m just a black man who wants to be a coach. I want to do the best I can. We know in life that things aren’t fair. We know that there should be more black, Asian, ethnic minorities in the game - and I hope people look at me and go yeah, it can happen<br /><br />When you’re growing up you’ve been told from an early age that you have to work hard, everyone works hard not just black people. But we were told that we have to because the chances are limited, and history tells you that - it tells you that we don’t get the opportunities that white people get<br /><br /><b>[Dyer, who is also an assistant coach for the Scotland national team, paid tribute to Scotland manager <a href="steve-clarke.html">Steve Clarke</a> for the opportunity he has given him within the game]</b> For him <b>[Clarke]</b>, there was no issue whether I was black, white or green. I’m always going to be happy and grateful to him that he’s given me the opportunity, but he would only give me that opportunity if he thinks I can do the job<br /><br />Everyone’s in the same boat. As long as the club’s got the players and we’re trained well enough, we’ll do the best we can. We know our budget. It’s not the biggest budget in the world, but it’s not the worst and we have to get what we can get in the building. As long as I can get players that are going to work hard and fight for the football club then we’ll have a chance</p>
