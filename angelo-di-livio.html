  <p><b>[Former Italy international Angelo Di Livio, who played for both clubs, believes that the visit of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> represents more than just a game for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> fans]</b> In Florence there’s a particular atmosphere ahead of this one, you can feel it in the air for two weeks prior. In Florence it’s a game that means more than a derby. The fans care very much, and the expectation is different than other games</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star Angelo Di Livio has hailed the qualities of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> always has to play. You can make him rest once every 15 games. He is admirable and it is proven by all his team-mates who get on so well with him. He is a super champion. He leads by example for his working attitude, his lifestyle, never a problem. Hats off<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are still a long shot from what I have seen this season before Covid. They struggled even in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and they have a super Lazio just one point behind them. They are at risk in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> as much as in the Champions League against <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. They have to come from behind, but I didn’t like their approach. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> boast a very unique mentality, we all know that. Whoever plays there knows exactly what to do with aggression, grit and love for the shirt. This season they looked a bit prissy, but they still top the league and have a game in hand to topple Lyon<br /><br />Not many have understood this change at the helm. You have to respect a winner. I hold <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> in high esteem because in comparison he looks so similar to <a href="marcello-lippi.html">Marcello Lippi</a>. He who wins can’t be sacked. <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> was pivotal for that and even for this <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. Of course, good luck to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, who has finally understood what it means to manage a club that has to win</p>
