  <p><b>[Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski says he feels sorry for <a href="tomas-rosicky.html">Tomas Rosicky</a>]</b> He continues to train alone at the moment. That has been going on for a long time now. I hoped we would meet each other at international level this weekend, but that is not going to happen. I am very sorry for him. He loves football and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have missed him</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the signing of Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski]</b> West Ham is a massive club so I’m really happy to be joining at such an exciting time here. I will do my best on and off the pitch to help the team to achieve the best results possible and can’t wait to start this new chapter of my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Lukasz Fabianski admits that he needed to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in order to become the goalkeeper he always believed he could be]</b> I wanted to prove myself on the pitch, but I didn’t have many chances, so it put a lot more pressure on every single game that I played. I found myself in situations where I was so keen to show my qualities, but many times it worked against me and I was punished for being too eager. I think what happens when you don’t play regularly is that all the little things that are very important for our position are a little bit off. Even when I started pre-season this year, I could feel a bit of a difference. Your timing is not there, your feeling of the game, your distances. When I made the decision to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it was based on that<br /><br /><b>[Fabianski added on the criticism he faced at times when with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a>]</b> I never spoke about it in a loud way, but inside of me I felt like that was actually one of the things that helped. It was something which drove me to get better. Over the years I think I have developed a better understanding of being a goalkeeper - and I mean on and off the pitch. I mean how to deal with certain situations, how to prepare myself for games, how to read the game. I think I needed to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to do that. I needed a new challenge in my life and I am very happy with how things have gone from that moment<br /><br /><b>[Fabianski is now 34 years of age, but believes he still has many good years left in him]</b> I don’t know how much I’ve got left in the tank, but I feel good. I just want to prepare myself well and keep trying to develop, because I think there is always room to develop and get better. I will just keep pushing. My aim is to get as much as I can from whatever I’ve got left</p>
