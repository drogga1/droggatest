  <p><b>[Ethan Finlay aims for resurgent Crew campaign in hopes of USMNT recall]</b> My first two years weren’t easy. There’s definitely that moment of like, ‘Did you make the right decision for your career?’. In high school you’re kind of the top dog, and I go to college and I have 71 starts and play all but one game. You’ve played every minute, it seems like, and all of a sudden you’re struggling to make a <b>[game-day roster]</b> and you’re sitting on the bench and you’re lucky to get in for 10 minutes. And then what do you do with that 10 minutes? It’s tough to do in this league.<br /><br />I had a lot of moments where you find yourself a little bit alone, and in those moments in all honesty you kind of have to come to terms with yourself that the only person that’s going to get you out of this is yourself. I was able to battle those internal demons and just say, ‘OK, it’s just going to happen<br /><br />With the coaching change, he’s got new guys and new ideas, which I think is good. It’s refreshing obviously for the national team and extremely important in a time of need. You talk about the recent call-ups - I think they’re very positive. For me, I see there’s a direct correlation, a clear correlation. Some of these guys that are having success at the club level are getting called in. Kellyn Acosta is just the perfect example of it, right? So for me, it’s about focusing first and foremost on what I’m doing here<br /><br />I’ve got probably 12 or 13 games before that roster would come out. What kind of numbers and what kind of performances can I string together in that time? So that’s the goal there. But it all goes through the Columbus Crew SC vessel. And it’s important not to get too fixated on it. I think last year I got a little fixated on it and my performance dipped during that April, early May time before last year’s competitions. That doesn’t help. So for me, it’s keeping a clear mindset on what we’re doing here with Columbus - and that will hopefully take care of itself</p>

  <p><b>[The Columbus Crew have sent midfielder Ethan Finlay to Minnesota United in exchange for allocation money]</b> I’m thrilled to be joining a club that is in its early stages in Major League Soccer. The opportunity to play in the state I was born is a boyhood dream come true. I hope to make an immediate impact on the field..</p>

  <p><b>[Allianz Field opens as Minnesota United gets its own soccer cathedral]</b> I never thought this day would come. I <b>[went to]</b> high school in Marshfield, Wisconsin, about three hours away from here. If I wanted to go to a professional game we had to drive almost six hours to Chicago. It’s going to be unique for our part of the country and we’re going to draw fans from all over the north Midwest.</p>
