<blockquote>
  <p>Much to the elation of fight fans, Nate Diaz has fought twice this year, and from the sounds of it, will do so again in the future. His brother Nick Diaz, however, does not seem to have much interest in fighting again.<br /><br />The elder Diaz brother was asked about a potential comeback in a recent interview with Ariel Helwani. He claimed he has no interest in fighting again, but added that it’s not really up to him<br /><br />While Diaz claimed he has no interest in fighting again, he did later imply that he could be interested in a fight with Jorge Masvidal at AT&amp;T Stadium in 2020. His team later confirmed to Helwani that this is their hope<br /><br />In the same interview, Diaz took credit for the changes that have been made to the UFC’s drug-testing protocols, specifically with respect to cannabis<br /><br />Nick Diaz has not fought since January of 2015, when he took on Anderson Silva. The bout was originally announced as a unanimous decision win for Silva but was later overturned when Silva tested positive for drostanolone and androsterone and Diaz tested positive for marijuana metabolites. This No Contest was preceded by decision loss to <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> and Carlos Condit. His last win occurred when he defeated BJ Penn in 2011</p>
