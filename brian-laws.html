<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Burnley captain <a href="graham-alexander.html">Graham Alexander</a> is likely to be offered a new contract at Turf Moor which will keep him playing past his 39th birthday, according to manager Brian Laws]</b> Graham is part of my team and I not going to be opening the door, saying thank you very much, and shutting it behind him. We will be sitting down over the next week or so and I expect him to be here next season. He will still be strong on the playing side - the coaching will take care of itself - we don’t want to detract from that. He will do that first and foremost as we don’t want to take away his qualities as a footballer. Just because of his age, you can’t say that’s it. Graham has shown already this season he is more than capable of performing, more than capable of playing for 90 minutes.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the eventual failure to survive, Laws believes Alexander has proven his quality as a player, demonstrated by his triumph as one of the club’s players of the year]</b> He has made a difference on the pitch. Long may it continue. It is about the quality of the player and the man. Graham has been very steady the whole way through. The fans like him and the players like him. You don’t have to be the matchwinner. You just have to make sure you got out there and give it your all. The consistency he has shown this season he deserves this accolade. When he hasn’t played we have missed</p>
