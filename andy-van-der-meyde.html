  <p><b>[Andy van der Meyde says Romelu Lukaku’s time in England is over]</b> I’ll tell you what I think, not what he told me in front of the cameras. For that, I refer you to the episode <b>[of my show]</b> that will be broadcast in a few weeks. I think this time in England is over and he can move to another like Serie A. On the other hand, Romelu’s message to one of your <b>[Italian]</b> TV stations in which he praised Antonio Conte by claiming that he is the best manager in the world, makes it clear. But to avoid specific problems, again this is just my personal opinion.<br /><br /><b>[The Dutchman said of Icardi]</b> I think he is a very good player and he was a good captain. So the situation is a bit bleak. But this is football. The players come and go. The team is more important than the single athlete<br /><br /><b>[While fearing that Icardi could be offloaded in the current window, Van der Meyde hopes that his services are retained and used alongside Lukaku]</b> They could be a pair of deadly strikers. Unbelievable. Do you know how many goals they could score?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Inter attacker Andy van der Meyde says <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> will score more <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> goals than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> this season]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is a fan of Italian football and I think he’s made for this competition. He is strong and can score many goals. He has a very powerful physical structure and this will put all Italian defences in crisis. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> can easily beat <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. He has always shown that he knows how to score wherever he has played, he is a pure centre-forward, while <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> plays most of the time out wide<br /><br /><b>[After a strong summer of signings and with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> at the helm, van der Meyde thinks Inter are on the right track but that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> will once again prove too strong]</b> I think <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is a good coach for Inter, which will bring stability and this is what Inter needs right now. They chose the ideal coach to start over and get back to the top. I think the title will go to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. They are always the best there is in Italy, the one that has more quality and more players than everyone. I believe that in the end they will win again</p>

  <p><b>[Andy van der Meyde says <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Hakim Ziyech</a> has made a mistake in agreeing to link up with Chelsea]</b> The Eredivise is a training party for <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a>. It makes sense that he looking for a new team. You need that as a top athlete. I just didn’t expect him to go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I don’t think it’s a top team nor a stable club. I would have expected <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or something of that size. Of course, it could be the hierarchy under below <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> changes if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are really punished and maybe <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will benefit from it and they will play for the prizes, but then again, if they play, I don’t think: ‘Wow, I’ll stay at home and watch</p>
