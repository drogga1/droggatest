Happy birthday, Theo, you’re dropped]</b> I’ve got to say he wasn’t chuffed to bits to get the call. And I understand that. Did he argue his case? Yes. Quite rightly, he said: ‘I’m one of the leading goalscorers in the league.<br /><br />I don’t mind being challenged on that. I totally respect that. I don’t expect him to be happy but I’ve got to make decisions and I think it was the right thing to call him to talk that through – even if the timing wasn’t great.<br /><br /><b>[The manager suggested Walcott had not done enough when he started in the qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia in October and came on as a 27th-minute substitute in the friendly against Spain in November]</b> I don’t think he transferred his early-season form into the matches we had in October and November with England. He’s a player I still like. I’ve said to him that I’m not ruling him out but, in terms of just having him as a squad player, I think it’s a better opportunity for me to look at one or two others. With our wide players – the way we’re playing at the moment we like to get the players between the lines slightly differently. Theo is more a player who runs in behind defences</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate pays tribute to former team-mate Ugo Ehiogu]</b> I know that football will be grieving because he was so highly respected by everybody he worked with and losing him at such a young age is difficult to come to terms with. Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him. I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other</p>

I am seeing a headline that says ‘Hart is not safe’…hut we need competition. Who knows who will be fit and available and too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit. We cannot rely on one or two players … we need players who can perform at a high level</p>

  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu remembered by Gareth Southgate]</b> I first met Ugo in 1995 when I signed for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. We were both young defenders and we played together as centre-backs. We had five years at Villa and then we both met up again at Middlesbrough, where we played together for another five seasons. The reality of a centre-back partnership is that you put your bodies on the line for each other. You get in the way, block the shots, you cover each other’s backs metaphorically and physically. We developed a really close, almost telepathic understanding of each other. But you play with someone for 10 years and ultimately so much is unspoken between you. There are so many parts of each other’s life that you know nothing about. I saw Ugo more socially at Villa. We were younger then and used to go out for dinner more often. He was a little introverted perhaps, but someone who just got on with his work in a very professional way. I remember he was meticulous about what he ate, which was a source of amusement then. Things would get sent back, but he had high standards and was single-minded enough not to worry about what people thought. Yet he was always very respectful. Although he was a quiet guy he was physically incredibly imposing. He was cut like a sculpture. One of the things when he died that hit me most was that he was just the most incredibly athletic lad. Although you understand that physical fitness doesn’t necessarily prevent a problem with the heart, it made it all the more difficult to get your head around: that someone who was the epitome of physical fitness could die so young</p>

They’ve got to play well and it’s going to be harder to get in, because you can see the players we’ve had to leave out who’ve got a lot of caps between them, high-level players, we know there are some others around the fringes that could be close.

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate says his young England team is not haunted by failure in the way other players have been]</b> I think when we first took over there was a group who had been scarred a little bit by disappointment, and there was maybe a limit with how much we could shift with that. I think those that have been with us over a period of time now have had far more positive experiences, so we don’t really have players who are haunted in England shirts. <b>[But]</b> we’ve had disappointments at the very latter stages of big matches<br /><br /><b>[Southgate believes his team must remain committed to playing the ball out of the back]</b> We have always maintained that to be a top team you have to be able to handle the ball from the goalkeeper right the way through. A couple of the goals we conceded <b>[in the Nations League]</b> had nothing to do with whether we play out from the back or not, thank heavens. And so they mustn’t lose faith in that, but equally, we had that a little bit against the Dutch and we went short too often and didn’t mix the game up. I think that to mix the game up … to be adaptable and recognise those decisions, to recognise those opportunities, is good play. I think that there is a requirement to entertain and to produce a style of play that people will watch. We have to try to achieve all of those things</p>

I think Ole has a young, energetic team, and I think Jesse’s pressing and the energy he brings to that has been an important part of what they’ve tried to do in the first few games. The inclusion of Jesse for us is partly because his form for us has always been good. I know there was stats on his goals. He was only involved in four games for us last season because of injury – two starts and two off the bench. He scored two and had a goal disallowed when he came on in the Nations League game. He had a very good World Cup.<br /><br />When you’re selecting a team, there’s half an eye on club form but also I don’t remember a game where he’s been really poor for us. He has different attributes.

But, equally, I think it’s good that we support him at this moment, in that you could argue club-wise, he’s on the fringes and whether he should be ahead of others.

  <p><b>[Southgate demands England players maintain intensity to keep places]</b> We need to keep ramping up the pressure. We know we won’t have as many high-pressure experiences in the next eight months or so, unless we start to make problems for ourselves with qualifying. So we have to bring that intensity to every training session. We’ve decided we need to challenge everybody more and more, not accept any taking the foot off the gas. The players understand that challenge, they want the challenge. I must not overreact to everything that happened that night against Holland (in the Nations League semi-final) - but we made too many errors in a big game. We know we will improve if our work’s right and our mentality is right. You have to constantly improve, tweak different patterns, constantly improve the detail. All the time, you’ve got to be on top of all of those things<br /><br /><b>[Southgate believes that the intense comptition for places will prove motivator enough for his players in the matches to come]</b> The players have their own motivation. But in the end, competition for places is a pretty good motivator. If you know there are people that can come into the team, that there are decisions with one player or the other and form and fitness at any given time that can determine who gets in. The younger guys now are after the older ones - the older ones are still proud and want to stay in, and that’s a really healthy situation</p>

I think we’re competitive against any team, but equally I think there are a number of teams who, on their day - as was proven in the summer - are capable of beating us. We have to keep striving to improve and I think the mentality of the team is to do that, they’re hungry to do that, they want to do that, they want to keep learning, we want to keep pushing each other every day in training, and if we do that, we’ll take those performances onto the field. So for us, I’m looking forward to the new international season, if you like<br /><br /><b>[One man expected to feature heavily over the next three years will be <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> forward Jadon Sancho]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, in terms of his game, is hugely exciting in terms of his balance, the quality of his crosses. He gets into areas behind defences and the way that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> play is a significant part of that. He plays lots of those low crosses across the six-yard box. What I really like is his decision-making. When he’s moving at speed, he’s able to get his head up and make the right decisions in terms of weight of pass, which pass is the best one to pick out. And that’s not an easy thing to do when you’re travelling at speed with the ball</p>

Mason’s performances already this season for his club, then in training this week and then when he went into the game – he’s a threat to the starting team. That is hugely encouraging for us, we know that with a lot of these lads their best years are probably three, four or five seasons away. We’ve got to get the balance right, keep on winning matches and blood those players at the right times. But English fans should be hugely excited when they see the likes of him and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> coming on and the impact they can have already, and we love working with them.

But it is safe to say we won’t be dropping him for tomorrow. His level of performance is so high that dropping him would be a rare occurrence. We might freshen the team a bit, that will be important. We don’t need to, everyone is fit and available. We need to make sure we get the balance right. We need to get the right attacking and defending profiles to make sure we win the game<br /><br /><b>[Southgate is wary of the threat posed by a second-placed Kosovo side, who have already defeated Czech Republic in Group A]</b> We are expecting a different sort of challenge to Saturday - but one we are looking forward to. It will be a very different style of game. Kosovo will be very high pressing, hard working, a more attacking threat than we faced on Saturday. Maybe there will be more space to play up front. Whatever we learned from Saturday’s game this is a completely different challenge<br /><br /><b>[Southgate gave praise to midfielder <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> for the way he has dealt with social media abuse directed towards him]</b> When I spoke with Declan about the possibility of him transferring association across, I was very conscious that this was something that could happen. That is why I wanted to tread very carefully, to make sure him and his family had all the time they needed to make a decision. I never pushed, because I suspected that this would be part of the consequences of that. I think he has dealt with everything incredibly maturely</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate said that England made poor defensive mistakes in Tuesday’s thrilling 5-3 defeat of Kosovo and has demanded that his side improve]</b> It had its moments! A bizarre game really. There were obvious poor errors for goals but I’m really pleased with the composure we showed. We had devastating attacking play throughout and we used the ball well. The mistakes were obvious, the errors, we have to be better. The players don’t need me to tell them that. The outstanding parts of our play were obvious, the errors were obvious</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate hails Sterling but expresses concern over England’s ‘crazy errors’ against Kosovo]</b> Our attacking play from Raheem, Jadon and Harry was outstanding. Raheem’s two performances have been of the highest level. I think he’s been almost unstoppable, his awareness of where defenders were, his ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal, and unselfish play as well, so I couldn’t speak highly enough of the way he played<br /><br />Jadon – you know we were talking about the three on Saturday – Jadon’s performance was at that level as well. He worked really hard for the team without the ball and showed the ability he has to go pa
