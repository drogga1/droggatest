  <p><b>[Theo Walcott omission is Gareth Southgate’s most bizarre decision yet]</b> I think Theo has a really valid claim for being included. He has scored a lot of goals for his club. He has obviously played a lot with England. I didn’t see him featuring in the games this week so in terms of having him in the longer squad, I wanted to look at one or two other players I don’t as much about. That is a really tough call on him and one I don’t expect him to be chuffed to bits about but, as I say, I wanted to look at a couple of others. He is still very much in our thinking. If he keeps playing well for his club there is no reason he can’t force his way back in as Michail Antonio and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have done this time.</p>

Quite rightly, he said: ‘I’m one of the leading goalscorers in the league.<br /><br />I don’t mind being challenged on that. I totally respect that. I don’t expect him to be happy but I’ve got to make decisions and I think it was the right thing to call him to talk that through - even if the timing wasn’t great.<br /><br /><b>[The manager suggested Walcott had not done enough when he started in the qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia in October and came on as a 27th-minute substitute in the friendly against Spain in November]</b> I don’t think he transferred his early-season form into the matches we had in October and November with England. He’s a player I still like. I’ve said to him that I’m not ruling him out but, in terms of just having him as a squad player, I think it’s a better opportunity for me to look at one or two others. With our wide players - the way we’re playing at the moment we like to get the players between the lines slightly differently. Theo is more a player who runs in behind defences</p>

Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him. I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other</p>

His preparation is different<br /><br />Our intention was always to give someone else a game - however that looks I will have to ride that out. I am seeing a headline that says ‘Hart is not safe’…hut we need competition. Who knows who will be fit and available and too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit.

  <p><b>[<a href="ugo-ehiogu.html">Ugo Ehiogu</a> remembered by Gareth Southgate]</b> I first met Ugo in 1995 when I signed for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. We were both young defenders and we played together as centre-backs. We had five years at Villa and then we both met up again at Middlesbrough, where we played together for another five seasons. The reality of a centre-back partnership is that you put your bodies on the line for each other. You get in the way, block the shots, you cover each other’s backs metaphorically and physically. We developed a really close, almost telepathic understanding of each other. But you play with someone for 10 years and ultimately so much is unspoken between you. There are so many parts of each other’s life that you know nothing about. I saw Ugo more socially at Villa. We were younger then and used to go out for dinner more often. He was a little introverted perhaps, but someone who just got on with his work in a very professional way. I remember he was meticulous about what he ate, which was a source of amusement then. Things would get sent back, but he had high standards and was single-minded enough not to worry about what people thought. Yet he was always very respectful. Although he was a quiet guy he was physically incredibly imposing. He was cut like a sculpture. One of the things when he died that hit me most was that he was just the most incredibly athletic lad. Although you understand that physical fitness doesn’t necessarily prevent a problem with the heart, it made it all the more difficult to get your head around: that someone who was the epitome of physical fitness could die so young</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has been recalled to the England squad for upcoming friendly dates with the Netherlands and Italy]</b> Jack’s a player that has unquestionable talent. The key for me is that he is playing in the games that matter for Arsenal. He’s getting closer to where we want him. His technical ability in the middle of the park will be very useful.<br /><br />Clearly the number one jersey is up for grabs. Joe Hart has had a difficult period with his club and he had to miss out on selection a few times when David Moyes came in. He’s got a great number of caps and he’s the most experienced keeper in our squad so we wanted to keep him around. With Nick Pope his form has been excellent. It’s great credit to Sean Dyche that we have got three Burnley players in our squad. We need to find out a bit more about them because if we lose one of our more experienced players then we will need them to fill the void, but Nick’s form has warranted his place in the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Who should be England’s No. 1 goalkeeper at World Cup 2018?]</b> It is unfortunate we are still weighing the decisions up, but that is where we are. Everyone is clearer on other positions in the field. But in goal, we have had someone who has been No. 1 for a period of time <b>[Hart]</b> but he currently isn’t No. 1 for his club due to a change in circumstance. Behind that, we don’t have another couple of 27, 28-year-olds who have had a lot of first-team experience or are playing at a Champions League club. Our next two are quite a bit younger. In Butland’s case, he has missed a year with injury. We just have to make the right decision. We monitor all their performances, we know their level. We know some are stronger in certain areas than others. We’ve got to pick the keeper in terms of who is going to be the best to play the way we want to play, handle the tournament and handle the experience of being England No. 1, which comes with responsibility.</p>

He worked the game out very well today, spotted the tactical changes the Dutch made in switching their system three times, speaking to others and telling them where to press. Obviously he’s one of the few guys who captains his club. Or has captained his club. He’s comfortable in that role. He’s comfortable to speak up for the group. He has a mindset for the collective, not the self. That’s a hugely important attribute for a captain to have.<br /><br />I heard some of the booing which isn’t acceptable. The rest … it’s not something I want to hear. Our players have represented their country really well tonight, with pride and some style. Anything that takes away from that performance would be a great shame</p>

You can make excuses at times for not putting young people in, accepting that they will make mistakes because of the way we were asking them to play, but I will take responsibility for that. It’s important for me to allow them to go and perform<br /><br />I don’t see it as a gamble and I don’t think being free of inhibition is gambling. Maybe it is brave to take players without the number of caps, but we have to give these guys belief. We pick from 33 per cent of the league, which is quite a unique situation, but there is excitement with where we are going</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane will captain England at the 2018 World Cup in Russia]</b> Harry has some outstanding personal qualities. He is a meticulous professional and one of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day. He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time and that has been his drive. My feeling is that over the last 18 months in the camps that he’s been with us he has shown that he has got the desire to take that into a team environment and he recognises the importance of bringing others with him. Of course, Harry will need the support of the other good leaders that we have got around him. You don’t become a top team by just having a good captain with good values because that has got to spread right throughout the group but I think he is the one who is ready to take that challenge on.</p>

  <p><b>[How Gareth Southgate made England fall back in love with football]</b> I was not a renowned fashion icon in my playing career so it’s strange to feel that way now! I’m certainly proud of the support we’re receiving. Our supporters have had a long time of suffering in terms of football. The enthusiasm they have for these players, they’ve been brilliant ambassadors for our country, it’s great for them they’ve got some enjoyable moments playing for England now. Our country’s been through some difficult moments in terms of unity, and football has the power to do that. We can feel the energy and the support from home, and it’s a very special feeling for us<br /><br /><b>[He was steeped in the culture of English football]</b> It’s been hugely rewarding. We know the academies are producing technically good players and we made a lot of changes with the national team, too many to highlight individually, to help us be successful. We believe we have to continue doing that, we have to evolve and improve. The experiences over the last few weeks, the milestones they’ve hit, they’re a great reference point<br /><br />We’re proud of the style, the intelligence. And we’ve performed under pressure with difficult games won in the last minute, with the extra time and penalties. We’ve made several pieces of history, our biggest win in the tournament, our first knockout win in 10 years, so we’re just looking to keep breaking those barriers down. It’s been an enjoyable journey and we want to keep it going<br /><br /><b>[The most recent of those involved a lot of these players at Euro 2016, which ended in defeat to Iceland]</b> Sometimes you have to go through difficult times and failures to learn and improve. A lot of young players involved two years ago suffered huge disappointment. We could have ignored that and looked to the future but we felt it was important to unpick it and find out exactly why we’ve had 10 years since we won a knockout game. <b>[There were]</b> a lot of areas we felt we might be able to improve</p>

When you’re ahead in a huge game, and one that many of our players hadn’t played in before, nobody knows how you’re going to react until you’re in it.<br /><br />We knew the team we brought was the most inexperienced team in the competition and the only way we’re going to boost that is by playing in more tournament games. I am immensely proud by the way the players have played and we can see by the reaction of the supporters, they felt the same. It was difficult to say anything that will make them feel better at his moment. They have not experienced that before playing with England and it also shows that it can be a memorable experience playing for their country<br /><br />It’s a very difficult situation to be in.

The Nations League really gives us something different to focus on and, from our perspective, the progression we want to make over the next few years is to be able to beat the likes of Spain and Croatia.</p>

We’ve thrown him in after a few games of the season. We’ve got quite a few players who are short of fitness and short of a bit of sharpness. To come into a game like that after so long out of the international scene is as tough a test as you can have.

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate bemoans lack of creative force for England]</b> The only one in my lifetime is Paul Gascoigne and I’m not sure he was developed, I think he was a consequence of a unique talent. I think what is happening at junior level is that there is more emphasis on technical ability, there is more, right from five, six, seven-year-olds, there is more emphasis on being able to handle the ball and play. We’re seeing that with some of our junior teams. But we can see there’s a period of time for those players to come through. We can see there’s a few players around our squad that have the ability to do that, but Spain have had a production line for a long period of time. Look at those who have gone and those that come into the team. Of that type of player, they’ve produced more than any other team in the world.</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate has sounded a warning that a failure to play English players in the Premier League could have repercussions on the international stage]</b> We’ve got to arrest this slide because it isn’t correct to say we’re not developing good players. There’s tremendous work going on at our academies. The big concern for me is this graph continues to fall away and that we end up in 10 years’ time with an England manager who has got 15% of the league to choose from. Why would that not happen? It’s a big danger for us.<br /><br />With a Phil Foden there has been a clear plan at Manchester City this season. But we need more of those sorts of opportunities for young players<br /><br />We can’t sit back, either as a league or a national federation and think ‘OK it’s all going well and so we sit’. Because those bloody Germans, they will be doing stuff. They’re out looking at how they get better. We have to keep improving from a position of strength, not wait until we are six or seven years on from this. It’s a good idea to review things when the momentum is positive</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate described England’s Nations League semi-final loss as painful]</b> We were talking before the game as a group of staff about the incredible games England played in tournaments, the twists and turns, it’s hard to take it all in. I thought it was a really high level of opponent, they posed us problems in the first half without creating clear chances. We solved those problems but throughout the game we made too many mistakes in our third, partly due to their pressure but partly just errors. We got into the lead and a poor goal from a set play, then we responded with our best spell, we changed the shape and got Raheem into the pocket as a 10 and we started to control the game.<br /><br />We scored, thought we’d scored, it was really fine margins, but we still controlled the game until the second goal. Last two goals are very difficult errors to account for. Incredibly proud, they gave absolutely everything, it’s painful for them and everybody but a night where we learned so much. Some individuals really stood out, <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> playing in that environment, <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> was outstanding, Raheem. So, tough to take in the end as you get to another semi-final it should be a positive but everyone leaves deflated.

I think fatigue has played a part, a lack of sharpness, but I’m asking them to play in a way that puts them under huge pressure at the back. We wouldn’t have reached the semi-finals without playing that way, to become a top team, Holland play like that too and made a poor error. I have to be there to support John, he’ll get criticism, but the way we ask them to play they take huge strain on their shoulders and they are courageous to do that.<br /><br />It’s the way we can and should play. That’s not why we lose, they were uncharacteristic and not errors we would make, it wasn’t risk it was poor execution and the last one was just fatigue.

That is hugely encouraging for us, we know that with a lot of these lads their best years are probably three, four or five seasons away.

The small period after half-time: ridiculous mistakes, poor decisions, lack of covering back. So, we made the game really uncomfortable for ourselves.

But those views represent many as well, so I think he’s aware of the power of his voice, but he also doesn’t waste it. I think he was very forthright in his social media posts <b>[about racism]</b>. I think he raised everybody’s awareness and made us all think, which was very mature and impressive. And, at the same time, he rose to the challenge with his club, with new signings coming in. You know, when you are at a club like that, to keep fighting off the quality of players that he has; and straight away with us, got the goals in Spain - first game after the World Cup for him, really. Croatia away, Spain. I think it was such a huge weight lifted for him, he almost jumped six foot in the stadium, didn’t he? So I think from that moment - because he did come home a bit sad after the World Cup, there’s no hiding from that. He didn’t deserve to feel that way, but that’s as he was, so it’s lovely to see the recognition he’s getting and how much extra I think that’s bringing out of him<br /><br /><b>[Asked how Sterling will have felt to have been made a scapegoat earlier in his international career]</b> Difficult for me to say.

I consult very closely with all of the players and in particular my senior players and they have a very good understanding of the way we’ve worked over the last couple of years, that has brought us a lot of togetherness, which is still there. Now we have to turn our attention to the football. We’ve got a hugely important qualifier to qualify for a European Championships.

When the games are going well they’ll flourish, play well and they’ll enjoy it. But when the games are more challenging or you’re behind in a game, then some young players can adapt and adjust to that immediately, but some will need time to work those things out. We have to get the balance right of leadership and experience while giving some of these young players their head, because we really think we should be investing in them for the long-term</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate would be ‘disappointed’ not to be linked to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> jobs]</b> I am completely fulfilled in the role, it’s a privilege to be the manager of England. Sometimes in life we are always looking at what’s coming next and not relishing how fortunate we are to be in the position that we are in. I feel like our team can still get better, there are objectives that we still want to achieve. In the future? I know realistically that I’m not going to be England manager in 10 years’ time - I hope to be in six months’ time. Somewhere in between that, there is going to be something else. I’d be disappointed if I wasn’t linked with some of those jobs if I’m honest. I don’t worry about it because my phone has not been ringing. I think that is because people know that I am committed to the job that I am in.<br /><br /><b>[Southgate had to deal with an internal bust-up between <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> during the last international break]</b> I think there are situations as a leader, where whatever decision you make will be criticised. There are some situations where there isn’t a perfect solution and you all have to just work things out as a group. Time needs to pass. I have to make a decision that is right for the team first and foremost, and also support both of the players. There are so many people involved in a situation like that - everybody is going to have an opinion. Those that have managed or coached before understand the complexities of any situation like that. The most important thing is the team and the performance of the team. We were able to focus internally on the football very quickly and we got the results we needed and both boys got back on the pitch. They definitely came closer together and Raheem’s message when Joe got an adverse reaction at Wembley was a really powerful one. I think that bought some closure on the episode. We are dealing with young men who are going to be emotional at times. Part of the strength of some of our players is that edge that they have. Through that adversity we are stronger for it</p>

I think that would be wrong. I think I said I probably regretted the way the message <b>[came over]</b> - by praising others for certain attributes, there was criticism for Chris. It was my fault and it was unfair on him. I think he’s done well in Italy. He’s playing at another big club. He was obviously playing at a big club before. We’re watching everybody because we’ve got to make sure we make the right decision. I spoke to him when I left him out of the squad and explained what I explained to everybody. Of course because of the way it came out, there was little point - I wasn’t going to say anything that hadn’t already been said</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate ready for ‘beautiful distraction that football can bring’ as England prepare for Euro 2021]</b> As we would have been gathering our squad for March fixtures this weekend, it felt an appropriate moment to write a message to all of our supporters. For everyone in our country, the primary focus of the present - and the coming months - is undoubtedly to look after our families, support our communities and work together to come through what is clearly the most extreme test that we’ve faced collectively in decades. On behalf of all the team and staff, I would like to take this opportunity to send our sympathies to those who have lost loved ones already. Our thoughts are with you and with those who sadly will suffer similarly in the coming period. In the way you’ve all come together to support our team, we must now work together to combat a virus that is causing physical and emotional issues to so many<br /><br />We are also conscious of the economic uncertainty affecting so many businesses and, consequently, virtually every family. Coupled with the unique challenges of self-isolation, the loss of routine to normal working and social life, we face real challenges to our mental wellbeing. Our children may feel anxious with uncertainty. It’s not normal for any of us and it’s going to challenge us all.<br /><br />Look out for each other. Please don’t suffer alone, and remember that our great country has come through these enormous challenges before - and, together, we will do so again.<br /><br />We were due to play next week and to represent you all this summer, but now is clearly not the moment for us to take centre-stage. The heroes will be the men and women who continue working tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families. They won’t receive the individual acclaim, but we all know their importance is beyond anything we do on the pitch.<br /><br />When we play again as an England team, it will be at a time when not only our country but the rest of the world as well is on the road to recovery. Hopefully we will be closer to each other than ever, and ready for the beautiful distraction that football can bring.<br /><br />To play in a European Championship next summer will still be possible for all of our squad and so we shouldn’t spend another moment thinking about the postponement of the competition. I feel sure that, when that moment comes, I will never have been prouder to be the leader. Again on behalf of us all, I wish you and your families strength and love to thrive through the challenges ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate believes the hindrance of black coaches and staff is football’s ‘biggest crime’ and called for the career path to be equal for all]</b> I think <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> is developing very well and on a similar route to what Steven did - in that Steven worked in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s academy for a couple of years. On a broader scale, we lack that representation. The biggest crime for us in any area, if we’re adults looking at kids, is if they sit and think that a path in life isn’t possible. And is not accessible. I heard <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Jermain Defoe</a> say a few days ago: ‘Is it worth me taking my <b>[coaching]</b> qualifications?’. We have to avoid the feeling that you can’t achieve something because that stops some people going for it. We have to make sure the opportunity is there when people are qualified and capable. And then, of course, they have to grasp that opportunity. If they can do well, they’ll role model what’s possible to the next generation<br /><br />I know that I got an opportunity at Middlesbrough when I wasn’t qualified. That came because I had worked at the club and the owner knew me. But I couldn’t say that opportunity would have been there for somebody else. And I think we are all very conscious of it<br /><br />The power of what is happening at the moment is that people are standing together and these observations, these deeper-seated issues are rightly leading to the broader debate on opportunity, on privilege, and it’s important people speak out. I do feel there is a moment for change but I’m also conscious that we’ve been here before. People have spoken brilliantly over the last week - people like Troy Townsend, Chris Grant and David Olusoga. A lot of that will be uncomfortable for white people, in particular, but they are critical voices to be heard. It’s also important to hear from white voices because ultimately they are going to be in the positions to open up opportunity. We are the ones who have to be educated</p>

There isn’t a downside for us if he stays with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> but if we see him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that brings different opportunities to see him in a different environment and how he adapts to that.

The beauty of him playing at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is he has played regularly and he has played in a team expected to hit a certain level. Champions League football is another bonus and that need to be challenging <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> all the way.

  <p><b>[Southgate says individual mistakes will not end international careers but he is keeping tabs on the players]</b> I won’t judge people purely on what’s happened now but we build a picture of evidence. When dealing with young men there will always be transgressions and I will never make a decision on someone based on one mistake or one misjudgement. Equally, I don’t miss much and you are constantly judging and assessing people and building a picture of what you’re going to be working with. We judge on the field and off the field, what’s the character and personality? We’ll be away for a lockdown of 40 to 60 days if we’re going to a tournament, how are those people going to cope with that? Are they dedicated enough? Professional enough? I’m not going to not pick somebody because of something that has happened in this period but we have a picture forming all the time of people’s lives and where they are at. Character is important, if we are going to be a winning team</p>
