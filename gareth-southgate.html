Quite rightly, he said: ‘I’m one of the leading goalscorers in the league.<br /><br />I don’t mind being challenged on that. I totally respect that. I don’t expect him to be happy but I’ve got to make decisions and I think it was the right thing to call him to talk that through - even if the timing wasn’t great.<br /><br /><b>[The manager suggested Walcott had not done enough when he started in the qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia in October and came on as a 27th-minute substitute in the friendly against Spain in November]</b> I don’t think he transferred his early-season form into the matches we had in October and November with England. He’s a player I still like. I’ve said to him that I’m not ruling him out but, in terms of just having him as a squad player, I think it’s a better opportunity for me to look at one or two others. With our wide players - the way we’re playing at the moment we like to get the players between the lines slightly differently. Theo is more a player who runs in behind defences</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate pays tribute to former team-mate Ugo Ehiogu]</b> I know that football will be grieving because he was so highly respected by everybody he worked with and losing him at such a young age is difficult to come to terms with. Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him. I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other</p>

I am seeing a headline that says ‘Hart is not safe’…hut we need competition. Who knows who will be fit and available and too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit.

  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu remembered by Gareth Southgate]</b> I first met Ugo in 1995 when I signed for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. We were both young defenders and we played together as centre-backs. We had five years at Villa and then we both met up again at Middlesbrough, where we played together for another five seasons. The reality of a centre-back partnership is that you put your bodies on the line for each other. You get in the way, block the shots, you cover each other’s backs metaphorically and physically. We developed a really close, almost telepathic understanding of each other. But you play with someone for 10 years and ultimately so much is unspoken between you. There are so many parts of each other’s life that you know nothing about. I saw Ugo more socially at Villa. We were younger then and used to go out for dinner more often. He was a little introverted perhaps, but someone who just got on with his work in a very professional way. I remember he was meticulous about what he ate, which was a source of amusement then. Things would get sent back, but he had high standards and was single-minded enough not to worry about what people thought. Yet he was always very respectful. Although he was a quiet guy he was physically incredibly imposing. He was cut like a sculpture. One of the things when he died that hit me most was that he was just the most incredibly athletic lad. Although you understand that physical fitness doesn’t necessarily prevent a problem with the heart, it made it all the more difficult to get your head around: that someone who was the epitome of physical fitness could die so young</p>

They’ve got to play well and it’s going to be harder to get in, because you can see the players we’ve had to leave out who’ve got a lot of caps between them, high-level players, we know there are some others around the fringes that could be close.

He’s a senior player and he’ll value the rest and recovery as much as anything else.

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate says his young England team is not haunted by failure in the way other players have been]</b> I think when we first took over there was a group who had been scarred a little bit by disappointment, and there was maybe a limit with how much we could shift with that. I think those that have been with us over a period of time now have had far more positive experiences, so we don’t really have players who are haunted in England shirts. <b>[But]</b> we’ve had disappointments at the very latter stages of big matches<br /><br /><b>[Southgate believes his team must remain committed to playing the ball out of the back]</b> We have always maintained that to be a top team you have to be able to handle the ball from the goalkeeper right the way through. A couple of the goals we conceded <b>[in the Nations League]</b> had nothing to do with whether we play out from the back or not, thank heavens. And so they mustn’t lose faith in that, but equally, we had that a little bit against the Dutch and we went short too often and didn’t mix the game up. I think that to mix the game up … to be adaptable and recognise those decisions, to recognise those opportunities, is good play. I think that there is a requirement to entertain and to produce a style of play that people will watch. We have to try to achieve all of those things</p>

I think Ole has a young, energetic team, and I think Jesse’s pressing and the energy he brings to that has been an important part of what they’ve tried to do in the first few games. The inclusion of Jesse for us is partly because his form for us has always been good. I know there was stats on his goals. He was only involved in four games for us last season because of injury - two starts and two off the bench. He scored two and had a goal disallowed when he came on in the Nations League game. He had a very good World Cup.<br /><br />When you’re selecting a team, there’s half an eye on club form but also I don’t remember a game where he’s been really poor for us. He has different attributes.

But, equally, I think it’s good that we support him at this moment, in that you could argue club-wise, he’s on the fringes and whether he should be ahead of others.

  <p><b>[Southgate demands England players maintain intensity to keep places]</b> We need to keep ramping up the pressure. We know we won’t have as many high-pressure experiences in the next eight months or so, unless we start to make problems for ourselves with qualifying. So we have to bring that intensity to every training session. We’ve decided we need to challenge everybody more and more, not accept any taking the foot off the gas. The players understand that challenge, they want the challenge. I must not overreact to everything that happened that night against Holland (in the Nations League semi-final) - but we made too many errors in a big game. We know we will improve if our work’s right and our mentality is right. You have to constantly improve, tweak different patterns, constantly improve the detail. All the time, you’ve got to be on top of all of those things<br /><br /><b>[Southgate believes that the intense comptition for places will prove motivator enough for his players in the matches to come]</b> The players have their own motivation. But in the end, competition for places is a pretty good motivator. If you know there are people that can come into the team, that there are decisions with one player or the other and form and fitness at any given time that can determine who gets in. The younger guys now are after the older ones - the older ones are still proud and want to stay in, and that’s a really healthy situation</p>

I think we’re competitive against any team, but equally I think there are a number of teams who, on their day - as was proven in the summer - are capable of beating us. We have to keep striving to improve and I think the mentality of the team is to do that, they’re hungry to do that, they want to do that, they want to keep learning, we want to keep pushing each other every day in training, and if we do that, we’ll take those performances onto the field. So for us, I’m looking forward to the new international season, if you like<br /><br /><b>[One man expected to feature heavily over the next three years will be <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> forward Jadon Sancho]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, in terms of his game, is hugely exciting in terms of his balance, the quality of his crosses. He gets into areas behind defences and the way that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> play is a significant part of that. He plays lots of those low crosses across the six-yard box. What I really like is his decision-making. When he’s moving at speed, he’s able to get his head up and make the right decisions in terms of weight of pass, which pass is the best one to pick out. And that’s not an easy thing to do when you’re travelling at speed with the ball</p>

Mason’s performances already this season for his club, then in training this week and then when he went into the game - he’s a threat to the starting team. That is hugely encouraging for us, we know that with a lot of these lads their best years are probably three, four or five seasons away. We’ve got to get the balance right, keep on winning matches and blood those players at the right times. But English fans should be hugely excited when they see the likes of him and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> coming on and the impact they can have already, and we love working with them.

But it is safe to say we won’t be dropping him for tomorrow. His level of performance is so high that dropping him would be a rare occurrence. We might freshen the team a bit, that will be important. We don’t need to, everyone is fit and available. We need to make sure we get the balance right. We need to get the right attacking and defending profiles to make sure we win the game<br /><br /><b>[Southgate is wary of the threat posed by a second-placed Kosovo side, who have already defeated Czech Republic in Group A]</b> We are expecting a different sort of challenge to Saturday - but one we are looking forward to. It will be a very different style of game. Kosovo will be very high pressing, hard working, a more attacking threat than we faced on Saturday. Maybe there will be more space to play up front. Whatever we learned from Saturday’s game this is a completely different challenge<br /><br /><b>[Southgate gave praise to midfielder <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> for the way he has dealt with social media abuse directed towards him]</b> When I spoke with Declan about the possibility of him transferring association across, I was very conscious that this was something that could happen. That is why I wanted to tread very carefully, to make sure him and his family had all the time they needed to make a decision. I never pushed, because I suspected that this would be part of the consequences of that. I think he has dealt with everything incredibly maturely</p>

A bizarre game really. There were obvious poor errors for goals but I’m really pleased with the composure we showed. We had devastating attacking play throughout and we used the ball well.

  <p><b>[Southgate hails Sterling but expresses concern over England’s ‘crazy errors’ against Kosovo]</b> Our attacking play from Raheem, Jadon and Harry was outstanding. Raheem’s two performances have been of the highest level. I think he’s been almost unstoppable, his awareness of where defenders were, his ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal, and unselfish play as well, so I couldn’t speak highly enough of the way he played<br /><br />Jadon - you know we were talking about the three on Saturday - Jadon’s performance was at that level as well. He worked really hard for the team without the ball and showed the ability he has to go past people, to be calm in tight areas. So, that part of our game was absolutely outstanding. We continued that threat for most of the game<br /><br /><b>[Errors saw England concede three goals to the visiting minnows]</b> It was bizarre. The outstanding features and the poor features are apparent to everybody, so we don’t need to get the video out and go back through it. Poor individual mistakes, a poor start to the game. I like the way we showed the composure to recover from that initial mistake and our use of the ball throughout the first half was excellent, right the way through the team. The small period after half-time: ridiculous mistakes, poor decisions, lack of covering back. So, we made the game really uncomfortable for ourselves. There were obviously mistakes that were concerning. Whether it was the intensity of the game, whether it was the pressure, I don’t know. We’ve got to reflect on that but they were such basic errors, really, that you have to learn from. We just made some crazy errors</p>

That’s still a brave thing to decide that: ‘Right, I’m going to own that space and I’m going to put my own views across’. But those views represent many as well, so I think he’s aware of the power of his voice, but he also doesn’t waste it. I think he was very forthright in his social media posts <b>[about racism]</b>. I think he raised everybody’s awareness and made us all think, which was very mature and impressive. And, at the same time, he rose to the challenge with his club, with new signings coming in. You know, when you are at a club like that, to keep fighting off the quality of players that he has; and straight away with us, got the goals in Spain - first game after the World Cup for him, really. Croatia away, Spain. I think it was such a huge weight lifted for him, he almost jumped six foot in the stadium, didn’t he? So I think from that moment - because he did come home a bit sad after the World Cup, there’s no hiding from that. He didn’t deserve to feel that way, but that’s as he was, so it’s lovely to see the recognition he’s getting and how much extra I think that’s bringing out of him<br /><br /><b>[Asked how Sterling will have felt to have been made a scapegoat earlier in his international career]</b> Difficult for me to say. I can only imagine. Everyone wants to be liked, don’t they? Everybody, players give their all. He’s a player that has always given his all … You know how much it means to him, how much he wants to do well. So, I think it’s for him to reflect on how he might have felt then and, for me, it’s just lovely to see a young man establishing himself, at the real top table in the game</p>

So that’s probably a bigger sign of the times, that we won’t have half the players on the field eligible for us. Then we have to pick up the pieces of that game. That’s the difficulty from our perspective but those that are playing are of good quality and, of course, it’s a huge game for all of them. We’re a few per cent higher this year, which is a positive step. You can see even by that small shift that we have two or three players we are picking now that we wouldn’t have had a chance to pick last season.

The priority for me is to keep the group together if possible and, as emotions calmed yesterday, that was clearly a possibility. I’m very impressed with the players, the way they worked it through collectively<br /><br />In the end I’m the manager and I’ve made a decision that I think was appropriate for how we want to move forward. I consult very closely with all of the players and in particular my senior players and they have a very good understanding of the way we’ve worked over the last couple of years, that has brought us a lot of togetherness, which is still there. Now we have to turn our attention to the football. We’ve got a hugely important qualifier to qualify for a European Championships. I love all of my players, we’re like a family and all families have disagreements. The most important thing is you communicate through those disagreements. I don’t expect, as a manager, to never have to deal with things that are difficult or unexpected. That’s part and parcel of the job<br /><br /><b>[Southgate is now eager for attention to be turned to competitive football within the England camp]</b> In my view, the group are moving forward. There seems to be all sorts of information being passed from all different areas. Team getting out, information getting out, there seems to be so much information in the background. Every player has had an opportunity to speak to me if they want to, and my view is that the group is ready to move forwards</p>

He is up against three outstanding, experienced centre-backs at his club. But he’s a young defender and we’ve always thought highly of him as a player and as a character. So he’s developing well. I know he’ll want to play more with us, but he’s already proved to us against the likes of Brazil and Germany that he can cope at the highest level and thrive at the highest level.

For everyone in our country, the primary focus of the present - and the coming months - is undoubtedly to look after our families, support our communities and work together to come through what is clearly the most extreme test that we’ve faced collectively in decades. On behalf of all the team and staff, I would like to take this opportunity to send our sympathies to those who have lost loved ones already. Our thoughts are with you and with those who sadly will suffer similarly in the coming period. In the way you’ve all come together to support our team, we must now work together to combat a virus that is causing physical and emotional issues to so many<br /><br />We are also conscious of the economic uncertainty affecting so many businesses and, consequently, virtually every family. Coupled with the unique challenges of self-isolation, the loss of routine to normal working and social life, we face real challenges to our mental wellbeing. Our children may feel anxious with uncertainty. It’s not normal for any of us and it’s going to challenge us all.<br /><br />Look out for each other. Please don’t suffer alone, and remember that our great country has come through these enormous challenges before - and, together, we will do so again.<br /><br />We were due to play next week and to represent you all this summer, but now is clearly not the moment for us to take centre-stage. The heroes will be the men and women who continue working tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families. They won’t receive the individual acclaim, but we all know their importance is beyond anything we do on the pitch.<br /><br />When we play again as an England team, it will be at a time when not only our country but the rest of the world as well is on the road to recovery. Hopefully we will be closer to each other than ever, and ready for the beautiful distraction that football can bring.<br /><br />To play in a European Championship next summer will still be possible for all of our squad and so we shouldn’t spend another moment thinking about the postponement of the competition.

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate penned an open letter to England fans laying out the unprecedented challenges their nation and the world now face due to COVID-19]</b> We were due to play next week and to represent you all this summer but now is clearly not the moment for us to take centre stage. The heroes will be the men and women who continue working tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families. They won’t receive the individual acclaim but we all know their importance is beyond anything we do on the pitch</p>

We will make a further announcement on our next steps in due course</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate believes the sky’s the limit for Rashford]</b> He is <b>[a special talent]</b>. We have to remember that I don’t think Harry <b>[Kane]</b>, at that age, had hardly played anywhere near the matches for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, really<br /><br />Some of the stepovers and things <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was doing at that age, he wasn’t converting them into the number of goals, so we have got to give him time to develop</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate believes the hindrance of black coaches and staff is football’s ‘biggest crime’ and called for the career path to be equal for all]</b> I think <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> is developing very well and on a similar route to what Steven did - in that Steven worked in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s academy for a couple of years. On a broader scale, we lack that representation. The biggest crime for us in any area, if we’re adults looking at kids, is if they sit and think that a path in life isn’t possible. And is not accessible. I heard <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Jermain Defoe</a> say a few days ago: ‘Is it worth me taking my <b>[coaching]</b> qualifications?’. We have to avoid the feeling that you can’t achieve something because that stops some people going for it. We have to make sure the opportunity is there when people are qualified and capable. And then, of course, they have to grasp that opportunity. If they can do well, they’ll role model what’s possible to the next generation<br /><br />I know that I got an opportunity at Middlesbrough when I wasn’t qualified. That came because I had worked at the club and the owner knew me. But I couldn’t say that opportunity would have been there for somebody else. And I think we are all very conscious of it<br /><br />The power of what is happening at the moment is that people are standing together and these observations, these deeper-seated issues are rightly leading to the broader debate on opportunity, on privilege, and it’s important people speak out. I do feel there is a moment for change but I’m also conscious that we’ve been here before. People have spoken brilliantly over the last week - people like Troy Townsend, Chris Grant and David Olusoga. A lot of that will be uncomfortable for white people, in particular, but they are critical voices to be heard. It’s also important to hear from white voices because ultimately they are going to be in the positions to open up opportunity. We are the ones who have to be educated</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate believes any decision <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> makes about his future will benefit England]</b> From a personal point of view, for England, whichever route opens up is positive. He’ll play at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he is well looked after by the staff and they give the right messages. There isn’t a downside for us if he stays with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> but if we see him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that brings different opportunities to see him in a different environment and how he adapts to that. The most important thing is that he keeps playing regularly, at his age that’s key to him learning and improving. The key is he has to play football. The beauty of him playing at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is he has played regularly and he has played in a team expected to hit a certain level. Champions League football is another bonus and that need to be challenging <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> all the way. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> would provide him with a different challenge, the depth of the league is a bit more intense - in terms of the quality</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate says individual mistakes will not end international careers but he is keeping tabs on the players]</b> I won’t judge people purely on what’s happened now but we build a picture of evidence. When dealing with young men there will always be transgressions and I will never make a decision on someone based on one mistake or one misjudgement. Equally, I don’t miss much and you are constantly judging and assessing people and building a picture of what you’re going to be working with. We judge on the field and off the field, what’s the character and personality? We’ll be away for a lockdown of 40 to 60 days if we’re going to a tournament, how are those people going to cope with that? Are they dedicated enough? Professional enough? I’m not going to not pick somebody because of something that has happened in this period but we have a picture forming all the time of people’s lives and where they are at. Character is important, if we are going to be a winning team</p>
