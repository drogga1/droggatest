  <p><b>[Sporting CP president Bruno de Carvalho says he wants <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> to end his career at home in Lisbon]</b> I would love for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to end his career here, at home. He represents a lot for us and it would be beautiful if he could end his career here. He is a world ambassador. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> always speaks well about us - he is very fond of the club. I believe selling <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> (to Manchester United) was a bad business deal both in sporting and financial aspects, I think he was also too young to leave. We are making a great effort for certain players to return to the club. We already did that with <a href="nani.html">Nani</a> <b>[who spent the 2014-15 campaign on loan at Sporting]</b> and we will see that many times</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo returns to his former club Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Tuesday and a special welcome is being prepared for him]</b> We have prepared something to welcome Cristiano, but we will have to wait and see how much we can do with the UEFA rules.<br /><br />He is a Sporting man and he will feel our support whenever he returns here. I think it will be beautiful and that the people will appreciate what we are going to do for one of our own. Cristiano is like a son to us and we would love to have him back at some stage.</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting CP president Bruno de Carvalho has challenged <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> fans to seek the truth from <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> and <a href="david-gold.html">David Gold</a> - whom he referred to as ‘the Dildo Brothers’ - regarding the botched transfer of William Carvalho]</b> Where is it? Proof? Now, approaches, for sure - I’ve had approaches for almost the whole squad. I’ll say this: ‘West Ham supporters call Mr. <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> and his brother, the Dildo Brother…‘<br /><br />The men have had fantastic results. They play in a 4-4-3, they do not have a goalkeeper, though the president is very happy with the coach who wanted William. Why would I want to give a Christmas gift to my enemy? I didn’t want to give them anything! These messengers, these offended virgins, the president of <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> … We must tell the truth!</p>

  <p><b>[Chaotic scenes at Portuguese giants Sporting have seen 19 players suspended amid a war of words between the first-team squad and outspoken president Bruno de Carvalho]</b> Our 11 men should have doubled efforts on the pitch to become 22. Coates and Mathieu did what the Atletico forwards couldn’t do on their own. Instead of 22 it was if we had nine players.<br /><br /><b>[Carvalho refused to let the issue lie and said in a Facebook post which has since been deleted]</b> These spoiled children think they’ll go far, but this time my patience has worn out for those who think they are above the club and any criticism</p>
