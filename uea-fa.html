From the very first whistle of our first match I could feel the enthusiasm of all of the players around me, and their passion for the sport. It was incredible to see so many girls at all levels come and compete for the ultimate prize. The trip was incredible and the experience invaluable for the team, really allowed us to come together as a team.</p>
