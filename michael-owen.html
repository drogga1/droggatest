  <p><b>[Former England striker Michael Owen has revealed that he still harbours resentment towards his old Three Lions team-mate <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> after the latter was sent off in a crunch clash with Argentina in the 1998 World Cup]</b> I’ll start by saying that David and I always got on well on a personal level. He was obviously a very talented player. I always admired him massively because I always felt that nobody, I repeat, nobody, worked harder than David to maximise the talent he did have. But after that World Cup in France, few would argue that his and my paths were different. I became the darling of English football for a period of time whereas he became the villain.<br /><br />The general feeling in the dressing room immediately after the match was that there was nothing to say about him getting sent off. What could any of us have said to him that would have changed anything? The damage was done. Whether I thought his actions lost us the game or not didn’t matter. For me, at that time, it was about hierarchy and standing. I was just a junior member of that squad. I was really just a kid. But… sitting here now, with the benefit of hindsight and perspective, I feel that what David did probably wasn’t a red card offence in the first place. While it was clearly pre-meditated, it was immature and petulant more than it was violent. But for me, that almost makes it worse.<br /><br />All I can say is that, as I sit here now writing this book, knowing how lucky a player is to appear in one World Cup, never mind more than one, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that what David did that day hadn’t let every single one of that England team down. Did he deserve the abuse he got afterwards? Certainly not. What human being needs to see his or her effigy being burned? But David let us down, and I still hold some resentment about it today</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen believes <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> is blaming him for his own failure as <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> manager as the pair’s public spat continues]</b> If <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> has come to the conclusion that I didn’t fancy playing in the last game against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> because I was worried about getting injured and subsequently worried about my next move then, if that’s what’s in his head and that’s how he’s overcome his disappointment of not being a success as <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> manager, then that’s fine in a way. It’s almost like a grieving period and sometimes you’ve got to blame someone else. I’ve done it loads of times in my life. Do you think I’ve come off a pitch and said ‘I’ve been rubbish today, it’s all my fault?’ No way. You’ll never be a footballer if you’re like that.<br /><br />You think ‘well the right-back can’t pass for toffee, the midfielder is not creative enough, my strike partner is not seeing my run’, whatever you think. Very rarely if you’re right at the top of the game do you blame yourself. As I say, it’s a compliment to <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>. He’s had to find some way of not blaming himself, I guess, for what happened with <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. But I find it hard that he’s come to the decision to blame me for it when I was hardly fit in the period he took over, and then I actually put my body on the line in the last game when really I was a week or two away from being fit from a groin injury. So I get it, I don’t agree with it. I don’t think that he will ever change his mind, change his view, so I almost think that bit is pointless<br /><br /><b>[Owen admitted that he has considered resolving his differences with <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> since they went their separate ways after that disastrous 2008-09 campaign, but he believes any attempt would be in vain]</b> I’ve often thought of it. A few years ago, I knew I was going to be in the same room doing TV with him and I thought about speaking to him then. But he’s a strong personality and so am I. I’m not going to change his mind. To be honest, I’m pretty surprised it hasn’t come out before because we haven’t spoken for a long period of time now, sadly. We were big mates prior to him taking charge of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but that was the turning point really and since then we haven’t been big mates, let’s say</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>’s selfish streak will not be a problem for Liverpool]</b> When you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s front three, you have <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, who is probably the most unselfish player in the world - he would lay on anything - so would be a dream to play with. At the other end of the spectrum, you have <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, who is just focused on scoring and wanting to be the goalscorer. Then you have <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, who sits in between - he likes scoring and is selfish when he needs to be - but he’s also quite generous in his passing. I think you have a great balance there, but it just boiled over the other day. I was doing the <b>[Burnley vs Liverpool]</b> game for television and I said at the time: ‘Have you seen that? There are a couple of times he <b>[Salah]</b> should have been passing.’<br /><br />Of course, it all blew up and I saw it coming in many ways. These problems happen all the time and it’s <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s job to smooth them over. But I do think that, as a striker, there is a balance in everything. There has to be one that’s unselfish and one who is selfish, otherwise you are never going to get any goals. I was always at my best with <a href="emile-heskey.html">Emile Heskey</a> - he was really unselfish and I was a really selfish so-and-so. But put me with another selfish player - another striker who was hungry for goals - and you wouldn’t necessarily hit it off the same<br /><br />I don’t think it will be a problem that will last. Next time Salah gets the ball, he will probably be more conscious that he has to pass sometimes, if there is a better opportunity. If he does, I guess it will be forgotten about, but these players are playing right on the edge at the very highest level and little things can just happen like that. It’s fine. These things happen all the time in every dressing-room - you get arguing all the time. Unfortunately for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, it happened in front of the cameras and he had to dampen it down, but things like that happen all the time at every club. Sometimes having an argument is quite a good thing because it keeps everyone on their toes. You are talking about 25 men in a squad who live in each other’s pockets for nine-10 months a year, so you are always going to have arguments, scuffles. Not everyone will get on, but it’s the manager’s job to piece it all together</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen has cast doubt on <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>’s capabilities in front of goal]</b> I don’t think scoring goals is what he goes to bed craving. I think it is overall performance, chipping in with goals, assists, everything. He is a better all-round player than me. He has a great touch and all round skill that I never had, but he hasn’t got the killer instinct that I had. I was just obsessed. Players like <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a>, <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> or <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> - these people who are obsessed with goals.

I know <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> was never a centre-forward as a kid. He always wanted to play wide or as a number ten and I know his coaches at the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> academy were always encouraging him to follow the ball in, get tap-ins and get into the box, be a goalscorer. It was never really his desire. He was always outside the box, great touch and everything else. He will always score a decent number of goals and he is an absolutely wonderfully talented player, but when you mention <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, that cold-blooded constantly thinking about goals, I don’t think <b>[he has that]</b>.</p>

I managed to muscle my way into the team to play alongside him at the 1998 World Cup and then played with him up front at the European Championship in 2000 as well. We scored plenty of goals together. He was then a big influence in me going to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> and we were big mates at that point. On the big stage, if you’re thinking, ‘I need someone to finish or take a penalty’, he had absolute nerves of steel. He had a huge amount of self-belief and confidence. In recent years, you can’t mention England centre-forwards in general without mentioning him<br /><br />It was difficult to leave <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> out because he was fantastic. But I’m going to put <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> in because, well, just look at his England record, his caps and some of his great moments. Of course, he was a very famous person off the pitch but, in the dressing room and around the squad, he was one of the lads. In my book, I praise him to high heaven but if I said to you asked you if <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> did the right thing in 1998 by kicking someone what would you say? Of course he didn’t. He got sent off. It wasn’t my fault, the fans’ or yours. He made a mistake. All I said in the book is that he made a mistake and that harmed our chances - it did. However, that doesn’t mean he’s not a great player and isn’t going to get in my team</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen admits he has been left bemused by the daily abuse he receives on social media from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans over his decision to join their rivals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2009]</b> Football is a job. A very special job and a privileged job, but it is still a job for the players and the managers involved in it. Obviously, fans who have a real passion for their club don’t see it in that light and that’s where the problems can start, especially in an age when social media gives people access to reach you. Fans never change their colours and we all understand that. It is their life, it is their passion, but they will change jobs from time to time in their careers and they don’t see that as betraying their former employer. These people who criticise you probably make similar moves in their careers. They might move from Barclays Bank to Lloyds Bank or from Sainsbury’s to Tesco’s and they are not accused of being disloyal. If a footballer moves from their club, these same people have a very different view. They accuse the player of lacking loyalty, of being a mercenary…. and yet the reality is, this is someone moving from one job to another, often with the aim of bettering themselves professionally and to look after their family. If you get a promotion in most jobs, you will get a pat on the back and people will congratulate you, but you are often all those unpleasant words I just mentioned if you leave one football club and join another. It’s madness, but it will always be the case<br /><br /><b>[Owen went on to insist he was not concerned by the controversy created by the release of his autobiography]</b> The serialisation in one of the newspapers wasn’t pleasant because that created headlines insinuating some things I didn’t even say. I had my crash helmet on for a couple of days. It was quite painful to read the stories that were written about me and hear the radio phone-ins speculating on what they thought I’d said before the book has even been released. A lot of what was written was not necessarily representative of what I said, but the last few days have been very positive after people actually read what is in the book and not what the headlines claimed I said. Now it’s all out there and I’m getting a lot of positive feedback. After reading the comments in context, people are agreeing with a lot of what I said, but I understand how this process works. You need the serialisation to get people talking, a few words here and there are lifted and it sparks debate, even if it might not be actually what has been written in the book. I guess you need the publicity to get people interested in the book, but it is galling when you are listening to radio chat shows and they are talking about something you never even said and taking it out of context</p>

All of a sudden, you’re looking at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - and I haven’t been able to say this for years - but you’re looking at that squad thinking ‘wow, they’re on their way back’. They spent lots of money on their defence, they’ve still got one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it’s starting to look very promising for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I haven’t been able to say that for a long time<br /><br /><b>[He added on the man currently calling the shots at the Theatre of Dreams]</b> I must admit, right at the start <b>[of the season]</b> you’d have to question <b>[Solskjaer’s appointment]</b>, because they were looking like there was no improvement. But just in the last month or two before the season stopped, I was starting to think he was doing the right thing and building a certain type of team that they didn’t have in the last few years</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen makes no apologies for having linked up with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2009]</b> I was leaving <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and the first thing I did was phone Carra <b>[Jamie Carragher]</b> and said ‘speak to Rafa Benitez’. Carra got back to me and said ‘no, he’s about to sign someone’. I think it was David Ngog, but he had already had some great players in the team and basically they didn’t need another centre-forward. What do you want me to do at that point? My agent then spoke to virtually every club on the planet to see who was interested and the options were <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a>, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. You can imagine my thought process – go to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, get hated, go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and get hated as well. As soon as I heard <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> were in for me then I thought, obviously first choice would be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and to go back there but if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t going to want me and these are all my options then wow, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the Champions League, I don’t have to move, I know loads of the lads. It was a brilliant move. I couldn’t believe my luck when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> came in for me. Here’s me, regressing as a player in my own mind and still the champions of England wanted to sign me. I was absolutely buzzing when they wanted me<br /><br />When I was growing up, winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would have been my massive dream, or winning the Champions League. As it is, I had to settle for winning quite a few trophies with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but none of them being <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which was unfortunate</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen says Salah, Mane &amp; <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> stronger together than apart]</b> I just think this current three, a bit like the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team really, it just clicks. If you lifted individual players and put them into different teams within <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would they be as good without each other? It is debatable and probably arguable that you would say no. This team just gels so well with each other and I think that the attacking players benefit so much from the full-backs that are really attacking players. The midfielders give a really solid foundation. I just think everything gels so well. To the eye, this three probably beat most attacking units over the years.</p>

I think it’s taken a huge bit of pressure off him that Fernandes has done fantastically well.

  <p><b>[Michael Owen believes <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> could have added Fernando Torres-esque qualities to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, which has seen him net 92 times in 155 appearances for Leipzig]</b> They’re great numbers aren’t they?

I’ve been watching him quite closely since the restart and he’s already started scoring goals, he’s very quick, can cut in from wide, times his runs brilliantly and he’s very direct as well, straight at the goal, a bit like Torres. I don’t think he plays exactly the same but I always used to feel that Torres would take that first touch and then be motoring forward. I like him a lot. I’m sure <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanted him but maybe the financial implications and where we’re standing in the world at the moment put them off <b>[…]</b> but I’m pretty sure they wanted him.<br /><br /><b>[Owen suggests that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> may have been scared off by Werner’s asking price]</b> That’s the problem. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> gave <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> a long-term contract not so long ago <b>[…]</b> they’ve almost nailed their colours to the mast in terms of, ‘Right, he’s our back-up in case anyone gets injured’.

  <p><b>[Man Utd still need a No 9 despite Martial hat-trick]</b> We’re judging a team that has been below-par for a long time. Now, all of a sudden, they have got a lot of good players. <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> missed a chance in the first half and if he had put it in, it would have been one of the goals of the season.

The main bulk of the squad is at the right age, they’ve certainly got a good few years to play together at the top of their game.
