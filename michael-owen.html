  <p><b>[Liverpool would be wrong to bring in Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez as a replacement for Philippe Coutinho]</b> Liverpool begin life without Philippe in what promises to be one of the games of the season played between the two most exciting sides in the division. I was asked this week if I thought Riyad, who has been linked with a move to Anfield, would be the ideal replacement for Coutinho but I couldn’t agree. As good a player as Mahrez is, he might not possess the pace or work ethic that Jurgen Klopp might be looking for and I wonder where he would fit into the starting XI - certainly not instead of the brilliant Mo Salah on the right side of the front three.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s remarkable exploits at Liverpool, which have delivered 41 goals, have him making club icons such as Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres look average]</b> Maybe, as Klopp suggested last week, we shouldn’t be too surprised at the rise and rise of Mohamed Salah. After all, his stats at Roma were impressive, with 19 goals last season. That said, he is beginning to make me and the likes of Robbie Fowler, Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez look average. And I don’t think anyone predicted he would score 41 goals by now for the club. I didn’t have him down as a natural goal-scorer at the start of the season. He was still a little like Raheem Sterling: raw and picking the wrong finish. He scored a lot but he missed a lot, too. But that chip against City changed my mind. With great goal-scorers, their mind works slower when they get a chance. Normal human behaviour when there is an accident, a crisis or stressful situation is to talk faster, breath heavier and panic. Being one on one with a goalkeeper clearly isn’t as stressful as a genuine trauma. But, in professional terms, it can induce anxiety and provoke similar reactions. Yet the best players can repress all of that. Most people’s hearts race given a chance like that. Salah has perfected the art of seeing the game in slow motion, allowing himself time to pick the right finish, even when the real-time speed is 100mph.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s defensive mindset is to blame for Manchester United falling flat and Alexis Sanchez looking a shadow of the player he was at Arsenal]</b> I’m always hesitant to say United need this or they need that. They’ve brought in great attacking players like Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alexis Sanchez and still looked flat. It’s not so much about personnel for United. Personally, when I look at that current United squad they should be doing better than they are. They are still not the United I expect to see. Jose is a defensive type of manager. He can make defenders look better and attackers look worse. If I was an attacker, I’d like to play in any other side in the top six than United. They brought in Sanchez, who was one of the best players in the league over the last few seasons, and he is just a shadow of the player he was at Arsenal. That is just because of Mourinho’s style of play. Everyone has to be working back and making tackles; filling space.<br /><br />United’s back four is only okay but you’re having players like Sanchez, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial rushing back to help out, and they are playing in front of the best goalkeeper in the world. That United squad, when I look at it, has the potential to be the best in the league and be much better than they actually are.</p>

  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane has been a frightening success at Real Madrid]</b> I never had Zidane down as a manager, I must admit. He was reasonably quiet in the dressing room. He didn’t miss a trick. You’d see him assessing the situation but I didn’t think he would want to go into management. It’s quite frightening what he has done <b>[winning two Champions League trophies, a league title and two FIFA Club World Cups since taking over in 2016]</b>. There’s been talk of him getting sacked even after winning back-to-back Champions Leagues and possibly three on the spin. Yes, there are some great players at the club. But he’s shaped them into a great team. To do that, so young, in his first real job, at a club which is so political. There are two huge papers <b>[covering Real Madrid]</b> fighting with each other. You have to keep both happy, or else one turns on you. Then you have the president. Then you have huge egos in the team. You’re juggling so many balls, more so than at any other club in the world. To do that with no experience of being a manager … .<br /><br /><b>[Zidane is currently chasing down a hat-trick of Champions League wins]</b> This could go either way. They’re contrasting teams in terms of experience and styles. I know everyone is putting Real Madrid as favourites but it’s a toss-of-a-coin game for me. I think we might know after 15-20 minutes where the game is going. If Liverpool are getting success, they could run away. The buzz around Anfield is huge. The style of play around Liverpool is a massive draw for neutrals. But if you’re a fan, it’s worth every penny to watch this Liverpool team. They rarely disappoint, especially in the big games</p>

  <p><b>[Salah can see ‘young, hungry’ Liverpool past ‘monster club’ Real Madrid]</b> I thought I could do what Ian Rush did. I thought I could go over to Spain, see what was what, and then after a year I could come back to Liverpool and carry on doing what I had been doing. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out like that. I wish it had, of course, but you don’t always get what you want.<br /><br /><b>[On Real Madrid]</b> It’s a monster of a club. Everything about that club screams history and tradition - the stadium, the players, the kit, the supporters. It’s one of the game’s true iconic clubs, known the world over. I know people talk about me leaving Liverpool and what happened after that, but I just had to go over there and experience it at Real Madrid. If I hadn’t, I’d have regretted it for the rest of my life. The way I see it, there are only a handful of clubs in world football that you can put on a pedestal, that you can feel the aura of as soon as you walk in. Real Madrid are one, Liverpool are another. Those shirts carry weight, you can feel the history. It’s there, every single day, every single game. I felt it at both. I’m so proud to have played for both<br /><br /><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo vs Mohamed Salah]</b> I cannot wait, trust me! It’s probably not the ideal thing for a pundit to say, but for me it’s a spin of a coin as to who wins. The way I see it, it’s such a contrast of styles that I think one has to prevail over the other. I can’t imagine a tight, cagey game where the teams cancel each other out. I think one will blow the other away, and I think we’ll see pretty early who that will be. Who do I think it’ll be? I don’t know! I think Liverpool have a really good chance though. They’re a different type of team to Real. They’re younger, maybe more naïve, maybe more hungry. Real are the masters of performing on the big stage - you only need to look at the amount of medals their players have won. Never mind Ronaldo, what about Ramos? Or Modric? Marcelo? Benzema? Kroos? These are all serial winners who know exactly what it takes to get the job done, and it’s a big task facing Liverpool. But I believe Liverpool have shown they are as good as any team around in a one-off game against one of the big boys. Look at the way they went at Manchester City, they don’t fear anybody and they have the game to take it to anyone. That, for me, makes it a fascinating clash<br /><br /><b>[On Mo Salah]</b> I wouldn’t say I’m surprised that he’s been such a good signing. We knew he had quality and talent. What’s surprised me is the consistency, that he’s managed to sustain his form over the whole season. You remember after about 20 games and his goal ratio was decent, and you almost expect a dry spell or a dip, because he’s a player coming into a new league. But he’s just gone on and on and on, if anything he’s got better as the season’s gone on. That’s been so impressive. I think he had a point to prove after what happened at Chelsea. But you know when you look at his numbers at Roma, they were pretty impressive. He’s just kicked on another level since coming to Liverpool. We knew he had pace and that he could run in behind, but what has impressed me is the way he can use his body to protect the ball. He bounces defenders off him and that’s enabled him to get into more and more scoring positions. He’s not a typical winger, he’s got an all-round game to him<br /><br />Why not? He just has to keep doing what he has been. I shared the Golden Boot in my first season in the Premier League as an 18-year-old, and people wondered whether I’d have to adapt because defenders get wary. But I won the Golden Boot the next season as a 19-year-old. When you have that form and that confidence, you just ride the wave. Look, this is the age of information. Every team, every player has all the data on Salah, they have all the stats and the clips and they have all come up with their own plans to stop him. They’ve doubled up on him, they’ve dropped off him, they’ve got tight, they’ve man marked him and tried to show him onto his right foot. And what’s happened? He’s scored 44 goals! He’s here to stay, I’m convinced of that. He’ll be at Liverpool next season and scoring goals. He might not get to 40-plus next season, but he won’t be far off. He’s that good a player</p>

  <p><b>[England have been told don’t live with regret]</b> I would say to the likes of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and the rest of the squad: take this opportunity. Don’t live with regret. Some of these players, like that trio, will probably get the chance to play in another World Cup. But you never know. Certainly for many of the squad there won’t be another chance to play in a tournament that only comes around every four years. And they certainly are unlikely ever to be in a World Cup draw like this again. They’re playing with confidence and style. Take that out on to the pitch against Colombia. Seize this moment and play with the flair we know that you have. England have a huge chance now in this tournament. That’s not to say that they yet have a huge chance of winning it. But there is an opportunity to flourish and go deep into the tournament. I spend plenty of time thinking about ‘what ifs’ when looking back on my England career. Over the next week, this team can ensure they don’t have to live with that when they’re retired..<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Kane]</b> Now the rest of the world is realising what we’ve all known for a few seasons: Harry Kane really is a world-class finisher. Your brain panics when you know there’s a good opportunity. Your heart beats faster and your breath shortens. All of which causes you to tense up. That’s the difference between Sterling, who will chip in with goals, and Kane, who is natural finisher and scores 30 a season</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen reveals he ‘couldn’t wait to retire’ after injury nightmare]</b> Once I did it once, I was gone really. I went from someone who scored goals, beat players, was quick, ran in channels and crossed the balls. I changed my game. The last six or seven years of my career, I just turned into the only thing I could. I was petrified of running into a channel, I just knew I was going to tear a muscle. The worst thing about it all, your instinct says what you’ve always done. I was bred to be a footballer. The worst thing is, you then get into a rut whereby you don’t even put yourself into a position where you are able to run. So you actually then go and stand in areas where you shouldn’t even be. You have lost everything. All I did at the end of my career for six or seven years, I hated it. I couldn’t wait to retire at the back end of my career because I wasn’t me.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd have been bang average for years]</b> What’s the difference between Manchester United at the moment and what they’ve been for the last three or four years? They have been bang average. The only thing is, Mourinho has bought more and more players. He’s bought the best player in the Premier League for the last three or four years in <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez. Forget whether he played today or not, he’s been bang average for so many games now for Manchester United. Look at <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, he’s winning World Cups and the best player for Juventus, now he’s very average for Manchester United. Every player that Jose Mourinho has, any attacking player, plays equally as well or worse. He doesn’t improve anybody from an attacking point of view. Defenders, yeah, because he’s a defensive manager, but the team is going nowhere at the moment and it hasn’t for four or five years</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would be the best player in the world under Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I think he’s a great player, although I find it quite frustrating watching him. Considering his age he ought to know a lot more and play a lot more maturely than he does. Consistency comes with maturity, but again there’s mitigating circumstances with the manager and things like that. Under Ferguson he would be the best player in the world. He got the best out of players and would see the unbelievable talent. You look at the likes of Eric Cantona. Even if he did something that everyone sees is wrong, Ferguson would still make a case and make allowances for players like that, because he realised how important they are. Mourinho has a long list of players … you look at Mohammed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne, players like that. Now Pogba and Alexis Sanchez. There’s no question that they’ve been better in different teams and I think you could say that about a lot of his players. Mourinho has improved some players - but the majority of those are defenders<br /><br />I’m convinced a manager has got so much importance to how the team plays. It’s no coincidence that with United, it doesn’t matter who they sign. I said at the time with Sanchez, he would be a far better player at Manchester City and it’s turned out to be correct. I’m convinced managers are hugely influential. You could put an average player in Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp’s side and they would look world class because of how they play and who they play alongside. Without naming names you could look at lots of players in those two teams who are only okay and all of a sudden people are calling them world beaters. I could name half a dozen at Liverpool and City. In other teams they’d just appear like normal players -now they’re being discussed in world-class terms. That’s down to the style of management</p>

Manchester United to me is going wide, it’s attacking, it’s speed, it’s getting even more strikers on the pitch, playing one-twos and great quick play. Lumping the ball into the box in the last minute, okay it’s worked, but it’s not for me.<br /><br />It’s not just been for two or three weeks that it’s been poor, it’s two or three years. Look at the empty seats. How are Manchester United not selling out their stadium? It’s unbelievable. What we’re seeing is poor performances, but that goal in the last minute has papered over the cracks once again. Yes, Manchester United have qualified and yes, they should celebrate that, but it’s papering over the cracks. It’s very, very average and it’s been average for some time</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United hold no fear to the Champions League heavyweights]</b> The really sad thing is the group winners are probably looking at the runners-up and thinking Atletico Madrid and Liverpool are the ones to avoid. Manchester United, as much as it still says Manchester United on the shirt, it’s just not the same Manchester United as it was six years-plus ago now. It’s been a pale shadow of that team for a long time now. They’re not the force to be reckoned with as they used to be. If they played next week I think they could beat Porto but I’d be very, very worried against anyone else. The good thing for Manchester United is there’s a couple of months now to regroup. At the minute, against any of those big boys, I couldn’t see them going through over two legs. The team just doesn’t reflect Manchester United teams that have gone deep in the competition on a regular basis.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would be one of the best players in the world if he played for Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola]</b> I think the manager has to take some of the blame - the system, the way he plays. I remember when he first signed they were trying all kinds of midfielders in and around him trying to get the best out of him. I feel sorry for him from that point of view but, as a player, it is frustrating when you watch him because he still looks like a 16 or 17-year-old learning the game. I think he could do a lot worse than just going to watch a load of videos of Paul Scholes - see when to play one touch, see when to take loads of touches, when to beat players … I think he makes so many bad decisions in games, which is frustrating because if he was playing as he should … if he was playing under a Guardiola or a Klopp or someone like that I think we’d be looking at certainly one of the best few players in the world, but at the moment we can’t say that<br /><br />I’m of the opinion that he is totally world class playing in a certain team in a certain way. I get very frustrated watching him because I know he’s better than what we see week in week out. I’m almost siding with him because I don’t think the way the team plays or the way the manager manages him is conducive to getting the best out of him<br /><br />The balance around him hasn’t worked at United. Mourinho has tried and it hasn’t worked. I think at United the blame always goes all to Pogba or all to Mourinho. And I think it’s very difficult to try to manage that. They need help because all the other players are almost getting out of it. There is no denying that Paul Pogba is a special player but I think right now he’s not playing because the intensity isn’t there</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United just can’t perform under Jose Mourinho]</b> I don’t really see anything changing. I honestly don’t. I think the players are far better than what they are showing but Mourinho, two and a half seasons now? If he’d been here six months, I’d think, ‘Wait until his players come in and he gets a transfer window and it all beds in’. Two-and-a-half years, is anything going to change now? It’s been pretty similar - in general they’ve not even threatened to win the league and they’ve gone and spent money which means you should be close to winning the league. Added to that, all the players he inherited, the best goalkeeper in the world, a good few youngsters coming through, it should be a lot better. I can’t see any which way where they’re going to improve. Until something changes, I can’t see anything improving for them I’m afraid.<br /><br />I think the bigger question is, player for player, are they <b>[United]</b> better <b>[than Liverpool]</b>? If they were managed by Jurgen Klopp let’s say, would they be a better team? They’d be miles better, 100 per cent. You’ve got Alexis Sanchez who has been the best player in the Premier League for three years and I know he’s injured but even when he was playing he’s not a shadow of what he was. <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku the same, <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba. The only good players that United have got at the moment in terms of playing at their maximum is <b>[David]</b> De Gea and <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford. Those players were given to him. His signings are really disappointing, <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof, Fred, there’s so many players underperforming. If Klopp or Guardiola was managing this team, they would be a lot better. They’ve got great players, they’re just not playing well. They’re much better for their international teams, we’ve seen them performing great for other teams, all of a sudden they arrive at United and they’re not performing at all. Yes, you can blame the players, individual mistakes, it’s not the manager kicking the ball out there, however, I think that Man City and Liverpool are a reflection of their managers, the way they want to press, the way they’ve got loads of energy and all these different attributes that they’re very good at. This Man United team at the moment just can’t perform and the buck eventually stops with the manager. We all know they can do more. They’re better players than this. I just don’t think anyone’s happy at the club right now</p>

It’s basically the shackles are now off and people can express themselves, people are actually smiling within the club now.

  <p><b>[Michael Owen believes the calibre of Liverpool’s front three will make it difficult for the Reds to recruit a world-class forward]</b> It is so much easier if you’re a scout or you’re in the recruitment department of any other club bar the top six. I mean, where do you go? How do you go and target someone, and they say ‘am I going to start?’ and you have to say ‘no, Salah will start or Mane will start’? You can’t go and get an absolute top player, unless they only have a couple of years left in their career. Or you go and buy the next young thing and maybe bleed him in for a year or so. To go and get someone in the guts of their career, at 24 or 25, that’s so hard, and that’s the only player that can really improve teams like this one. I know it’s a dream for everyone <b>[to sign world-class players]</b> but it’s so hard to improve your team if you are in the top six, unless you’re not happy with one of your players and you look to replace them. But Liverpool have a great front three, and so if they’re going to buy, it would more likely be one of the options I mentioned.<br /><br /><b>[Salah’s versatility]</b> He switches, depending on what the manager wants. After half a dozen games of the season, people were saying he’s not the player he was, but when you looked at his stats, which I did because of the job I’m in, they were all either the same or slightly better than last season. I suppose visually, the team weren’t quite firing like they were, but again all the stats were saying they were performing well. It was only our impression, and the fact that maybe we weren’t blown away by the performances quite as often. For me, as long as he’s scoring goals, making assists and playing well, you can’t complain. He’s top scorer in the league, isn’t he? And player of the month? Can’t be bad!<br /><br />We’ve seen in the last month or two that there can be massive swings. But as it stands I’d prefer to be where Liverpool are than City. Everyone makes City favourites, but I’m not so sure about that, and obviously Tottenham are still there too. It’s been brilliant. Last season was a bit boring because it was done so early, but this season it’s exciting, and even more so for me because Liverpool are right in there playing a huge part</p>

In England, we’re all very proud of him.<br /><br /><b>[Bringing Zidane back to replace Santiago Solari as coach]</b> Things will calm down with him back at the club.

I was sure that he was going to go into coaching when his playing career was over - for the way he is. He’s intelligent and what he’s achieved is incredible. His return to Madrid is fantastic for everyone. Zidane’s very calm, he understands the game and the players and that’s very important. I think the best coaches at the moment are doing well because they understand the players and they can share their experience. Maybe some of the older coaches won’t have that kind of experience. Football changes and the way teams are managed as well. Zidane has a very good relationship with all of his players. He’s someone who they respect.

Did he deserve the abuse he got afterwards? Certainly not. What human being needs to see his or her effigy being burned? But David let us down, and I still hold some resentment about it today</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen has revealed that <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> would be included in his all-time England XI, despite the pair having been engaged in a public Twitter spat over the serialisation of the former’s autobiography]</b> When I was growing up I would’ve been looking at Alan thinking ‘What a player’. I managed to muscle my way into the team to play alongside him at the 1998 World Cup and then played with him up front at the European Championship in 2000 as well. We scored plenty of goals together. He was then a big influence in me going to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> and we were big mates at that point. On the big stage, if you’re thinking, ‘I need someone to finish or take a penalty’, he had absolute nerves of steel. He had a huge amount of self-belief and confidence. In recent years, you can’t mention England centre-forwards in general without mentioning him<br /><br />It was difficult to leave <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> out because he was fantastic. But I’m going to put <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> in because, well, just look at his England record, his caps and some of his great moments. Of course, he was a very famous person off the pitch but, in the dressing room and around the squad, he was one of the lads. In my book, I praise him to high heaven but if I said to you asked you if <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> did the right thing in 1998 by kicking someone what would you say? Of course he didn’t. He got sent off. It wasn’t my fault, the fans’ or yours. He made a mistake. All I said in the book is that he made a mistake and that harmed our chances - it did. However, that doesn’t mean he’s not a great player and isn’t going to get in my team</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen admits he has been left bemused by the daily abuse he receives on social media from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans over his decision to join their rivals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2009]</b> Football is a job. A very special job and a privileged job, but it is still a job for the players and the managers involved in it. Obviously, fans who have a real passion for their club don’t see it in that light and that’s where the problems can start, especially in an age when social media gives people access to reach you. Fans never change their colours and we all understand that. It is their life, it is their passion, but they will change jobs from time to time in their careers and they don’t see that as betraying their former employer. These people who criticise you probably make similar moves in their careers. They might move from Barclays Bank to Lloyds Bank or from Sainsbury’s to Tesco’s and they are not accused of being disloyal. If a footballer moves from their club, these same people have a very different view. They accuse the player of lacking loyalty, of being a mercenary…. and yet the reality is, this is someone moving from one job to another, often with the aim of bettering themselves professionally and to look after their family. If you get a promotion in most jobs, you will get a pat on the back and people will congratulate you, but you are often all those unpleasant words I just mentioned if you leave one football club and join another. It’s madness, but it will always be the case<br /><br /><b>[Owen went on to insist he was not concerned by the controversy created by the release of his autobiography]</b> The serialisation in one of the newspapers wasn’t pleasant because that created headlines insinuating some things I didn’t even say. I had my crash helmet on for a couple of days. It was quite painful to read the stories that were written about me and hear the radio phone-ins speculating on what they thought I’d said before the book has even been released. A lot of what was written was not necessarily representative of what I said, but the last few days have been very positive after people actually read what is in the book and not what the headlines claimed I said. Now it’s all out there and I’m getting a lot of positive feedback. After reading the comments in context, people are agreeing with a lot of what I said, but I understand how this process works. You need the serialisation to get people talking, a few words here and there are lifted and it sparks debate, even if it might not be actually what has been written in the book. I guess you need the publicity to get people interested in the book, but it is galling when you are listening to radio chat shows and they are talking about something you never even said and taking it out of context</p>

The Madrid players will sit in there dressing room, look at each other and say ‘How good were that team we’ve just beaten? We’ve never played anything like that’.

The front three get a lot of headlines of course. The two full-backs get a lot of headlines, they’re amazing. Probably the area of the pitch that gets the least headlines is the midfield, the three midfielders. But a lot of people are now starting to think that <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> has such a huge influence on that team and I’d have to agree with that.

It’s okay buying players who are already brilliant but he’s making even average players look world class in certain cases. They’ve got some great players, they’re an unbelievably talented team and it looks like it’s a very happy place. Everybody’s desperate to play for each other and now all of a sudden you’re wondering whether anybody can catch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for the next few years because they are head and shoulders better than anybody else at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Owen makes no apologies for having linked up with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2009]</b> I was leaving <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and the first thing I did was phone Carra <b>[<a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a>]</b> and said ‘speak to Rafa Benitez’.
