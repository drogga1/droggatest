  <p><b>[Arsenal Women goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin reveals she had coronavirus]</b> I was still frightened. All the doctors I had told me that I had contracted Covid-19. I had a lot of symptoms related to this virus: fever, cold, constant headache, respiratory discomfort, immense fatigue and loss of taste and smell. I checked a lot of boxes. My mother told me that I had the symptoms of coronavirus, and I’m starting to really be afraid. The difficulty in breathing followed. There, I really freaked out because it was stressful, the stress causes hyper ventilation and so on. Trying to phone people or say things, I couldn’t do it and it caused fatigue like I never had. It put me to bed. It’s been 11 days since I have been out of my house at all. Otherwise it’s better<br /><br />I would like to give a big thumbs up to the whole medical profession<br /><br />It’s true I started having some symptoms when we got the phone call from the club to let us know that we might be exposed to the virus because of the owner of <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> and in that moment, I don’t know, I felt something within me, that I had it. Then you realise: ‘Wow, everybody can be exposed here, this is very serious’ and you start to think about the people that you’ve been in contact with and the other people that can be related to us. That’s when a bit of fear comes. In terms of symptoms, it was a normal virus for me. I had three or four days which were a little bit difficult, with a bit of a temperature and a dry cough, and some discomfort in my chest. That was it. The difficulty is that I have people at home, three kids as well and I was worried. My missus has been through it and my nanny’s been through it. Thank God, the kids never got it. We are all completely fine now</p>
