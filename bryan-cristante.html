  <p><b>[On-loan Atalanta midfielder Bryan Cristante has refused to rule out a summer move to the Premier League]</b> I don’t know if Juventus want me. What I will do next summer depends on the next five months. I can’t rule out a move to the Premier League. I think it’s a good league for me and my qualities. One must always believe in his qualities. I’ve never cared about criticisms, I’ve always listened to my manager. I always give my best, I always work hard. Let’s see what the future has in store for me<br /><br />So many people tell me: ‘The Premier League is the perfect place for you,’ and I agree with them. It’s physical, there’s a lot of tackling and open football. I can really see myself there</p>

  <p><b>[Roma midfielder Bryan Cristante has revealed how he successfully fought off two thieves who attempted to steal his Rolex watch]</b> It was 10:30am and I was in my car waiting between Viale Angelico and Viale delle Milizie for the red light to change. All of a sudden a person with a helmet tried to get into my car, grabbed my wrist and tried to steal my watch. I reacted by punching his helmet twice, which split the visor. The robber fell to the ground and I could see he didn’t know what to do before an accomplice arrived on a T-Max (scooter) and they drove away</p>
