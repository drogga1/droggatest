  <p><b>[Everton have confirmed that veteran left-back Leighton Baines will remain at the club for at least another year after signing a new contract to take him through to the end of 2019-20]</b> I do feel as proud as when I first signed. As you get older, you realise the work you need to do to sustain the level required by the club. To be judged to be at that level in the later stages of your career is testament to the work you do. You take pride in it all. When you look at the back end of last season and how well we played and the results we picked up against some good teams it gives us plenty of optimism going into this season. We are confident about what we can do and striving to achieve success.</p>
