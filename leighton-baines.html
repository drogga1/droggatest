  <p><b>[Leighton Baines, who started both wins over Norway and Switzerland, insists every England player is taking responsibility]</b> We are not being told to do it, but there is a desire to put the onus on ourselves to leave no stone unturned and we are all keen to get back to where we want to be. We’ve done that in the last week. We’re all hurting from the summer and we don’t want that situation again so we’ll work as hard as we can to make sure we’re the best we can be. It’s not easy for the manager and his staff to implement the ideas in such a short period time. You can do a certain amount of work on the pitch but you’re never too far away from a game so you have to be careful. The meetings are important, the videos and in this last trip the staff really put a lot more emphasis on us to speak up and give our own opinions and I think that has been really helpful. It just makes sense if someone has an opinion, there is not just one or two people from the group speaking. It’s everyone gets to voice their opinion and they can be taken into consideration and then collectively make more of a point. Obviously, the final call will always be the manager’s, but I think he is really open to listening to what the players have to say and taking that into consideration.</p>

  <p><b>[The England squad would be delighted to see manager Roy Hodgson’s contract extended beyond Euro 2016]</b> The players would all be delighted with that <b>[Hodgson extending his contract]</b>. We all enjoy working with him. He’s a good guy, a good person to speak to. He’s got a lot of knowledge about football, has had a lot of different jobs, worked in different countries. Us, as a bunch of players, would be really happy if he extended.<br /><br />Wayne’s always been someone that people have focused on and we’ve asked a lot of him over the years as well and he tended to produce. He’s now moved onto his role as captain and rightly so - he earned that right to be leading the team now, he’s a leader among the squad. He’s great for all the players but particularly for people like Ross and the other young players who he’s often offering advice to so I think it was the natural fit once Steven <b>[Gerrard]</b> retired for Wayne to step up and fill that role</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have confirmed that veteran left-back Leighton Baines will remain at the club for at least another year after signing a new contract to take him through to the end of 2019-20]</b> I do feel as proud as when I first signed. As you get older, you realise the work you need to do to sustain the level required by the club. To be judged to be at that level in the later stages of your career is testament to the work you do. You take pride in it all. When you look at the back end of last season and how well we played and the results we picked up against some good teams it gives us plenty of optimism going into this season. We are confident about what we can do and striving to achieve success.</p>
