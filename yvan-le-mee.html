  <p><b>[Who is <a href="ferland-mendy.html">Ferland Mendy</a>?]</b> He’s the <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> of the left-back role. Contrary to popular belief, the left-back position is the most requested after that of a striker because they’re very difficult to find. Mendy is good offensively and defensively, which is very rare. Balanced guys, who are exciting going forward and very strong at the back, are very rare. At his age, there’s no-one better. Apart from <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>, who won’t move from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, there’s no such talented player in that role available, especially as <a href="lucas-hernandez.html">Lucas Hernandez</a> has a different profile</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ferland-mendy.html">Ferland Mendy</a>’s agent says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> worth €300m but summer <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move impossible due to coronavirus]</b> <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, in a normal context, without this horrible virus or the economic problem that is coming, you could think that he was going to sign for Madrid this summer, because it also does not seem that he is going to renew his contract, and he has two years left on his contract. But with all this, it seems impossible to me that a club now spends what <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> costs. Because, if <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is worth €222 million, Kylian is worth €300m, because he is younger and is just as good, extraordinary. He is going to be the best striker in the world and I think he is going to want to play for the best club in the world, which is Madrid, and for one of his idols to train him, which is <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. Also today there is no great competition in Madrid’s attack. It is where there is more demand. They have a great striker like <b>[Karim]</b> <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>, but he is approaching the last years of his career. Today there is more competition in <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s attack than in Madrid’s and they would surely find a place for him without a problem. This year there will be no big transfers because they are not going to do crazy things and I think it will come after the Euros.</p>
