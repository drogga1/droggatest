  <p><b>[Spain coach Julen Lopetegui speaks about forward <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>’s qualities as a player]</b> If you are with us it is because we consider that your presence is important. We love you just the way you are. He has many good things and many to improve. We want him a little angry. Not a lot, but a little, yes, because he expresses this in his football as always. We love that part of Diego and we look for it</p>

  <p><b>[Lopetegui, who last month signed a contract extension with Spain until 2022, admitted was disappointed not to have the chance to lead his country at the World Cup but defended his conduct in negotiations with Madrid]</b> Yesterday was the saddest day of my life, since the death of my mother.

I wanted to give a press conference that day but could not. I am clear that the only motive to announce it was to be honest and transparent.<br /><br />I am very relaxed, all of us are, we have acted in a fully professional and honest way. If someone wants to understand things another way, they can. But we have been professional, honest, and clear<br /><br />I will support this magnificent group of players. In two years I have had four presidents in the federation. We survived with the strength of the squad, the team and that strength can make them world champions<br /><br />I came here aged 18 to play for Castilla, to experience the values and the loyalty. I had the fortune to coach Castilla, and now have this great responsibility to coach <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> coach Julen Lopetegui has warned <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> that clubs will need at least five weeks’ notice to prepare for a return to action]</b> The circumstances and guarantees have to be in place and then we have to have a certain amount of time. The end of the season is going to be an experiment because we do not know what’s going to happen. We have to be calm and wait, giving importance to public health. What I can assure is this will be nothing like a return after a summer break. Neither the form nor the mind is going to be 20 per cent of what it would be in a normal pre-season. We are clear on that. I think when the circumstances allow, with the guarantees from the government, a period of adaption will be necessary to preserve the other part of the health, not just the virus. Don’t forget that in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the Segunda, everyone imagines <b>[us having]</b> big houses, but that’s not the majority. We are all humans, with concerns, there have been cases <b>[of the virus]</b> in teams. All that’s going on is not removed from any profession and it affects the players. We will have to speak about preparation time but, as a manager, I see we will need a minimum of five weeks to be in a situation where we can play every three days in a setting that no one has experienced before, not just playing behind closed doors, but after everything this nightmare has provoked. We have to be in the best physical condition</p>
