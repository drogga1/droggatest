He’s very young and has just arrived in Europe. He’s really keen to learn and we’ve got to give him the time to settle that every player needs.

It is unknown for most coaches what it is like to be in charge of Spain but the day-to-day is demanding, different.<br /><br /><b>[Lopetegui insists he will be backing Luis Enrique and Spain in their future endeavours]</b> Not at all, I am very happy to train Madrid, we have a great challenge, a fantastic objective and I have a lot of hope that it goes great for the national team with Luis Enrique.

We are all focused on what we have to do now and the past is in the past. The way it happened cannot be changed. I don’t want to look backwards, I explained at my presentation what I felt and I feel the same now. I am not uncomfortable about what was said and I am just concentrating on the present.

  <p><b>[Lopetegui targets Premier League after Real Madrid nightmare]</b> A coach needs to be open for the future, but if I can choose, I prefer to be in the best leagues. England is a fantastic league. When you watch a match in England, you can feel the atmosphere, the respect for the players and the coaches, this is very important. I want to feel that. Of course Spain is a fantastic league too, with fantastic players and coaches, but we will see.<br /><br />It was not easy for me. We worked very hard for two years, we felt that we were ready to have a fantastic World Cup. Two months previously, when I signed a new contract with Spain, they put a buyout clause in. It was <b>[Luis]</b> Rubiales’ idea, I agreed it with him no problem and then it <b>[the Real Madrid job offer]</b> happened. The timing was not chosen by me or Real Madrid - I said yes, but I knew the World Cup was my only responsibility. To keep it secret for one month is impossible and was not honest. We were convinced it was best to have a press conference to open and close the issue then, after that, the only focus was the World Cup. The players were fantastic. After I told them, we had our best training session in the three weeks of our preparation so we were very happy but in the end the president took that decision. It was a very hard moment and I will never forget it because it was a surprise. I felt it was very unfair. It was a five-hour flight home from Moscow to Madrid and I did not say anything but that is life. It was a very hard experience but you need to try and put it in a positive situation<br /><br />We had a good start, the team was playing well but then we had three very bad weeks. You just hope you have time to find a solution because these things can balance out over a season. We were sure this situation was going to pass. I didn’t have time, that is the best way I can explain it. I have all respect for the new coach <b>[Santiago Solari]</b>, his new staff. And the players - I love them, they had a fantastic attitude with me. I would never say a bad word about Real Madrid. To manage the club is a fantastic experience for any coach. I hoped I could have more time but I have to look to the future</p>

We thought that there was still time and we had something that was crucial: absolute commitment from the players and from a team that had a great deal to give<br /><br /><b>[He pointed to the results achieved under his tutelage to suggest that the Roja would have fared better]</b> We had gone two years without losing and played against Germany, France, Belgium, England, Italy.

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> coach Julen Lopetegui has warned <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> that clubs will need at least five weeks’ notice to prepare for a return to action]</b> The circumstances and guarantees have to be in place and then we have to have a certain amount of time. The end of the season is going to be an experiment because we do not know what’s going to happen. We have to be calm and wait, giving importance to public health. What I can assure is this will be nothing like a return after a summer break. Neither the form nor the mind is going to be 20 per cent of what it would be in a normal pre-season. We are clear on that. I think when the circumstances allow, with the guarantees from the government, a period of adaption will be necessary to preserve the other part of the health, not just the virus. Don’t forget that in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the Segunda, everyone imagines <b>[us having]</b> big houses, but that’s not the majority. We are all humans, with concerns, there have been cases <b>[of the virus]</b> in teams. All that’s going on is not removed from any profession and it affects the players. We will have to speak about preparation time but, as a manager, I see we will need a minimum of five weeks to be in a situation where we can play every three days in a setting that no one has experienced before, not just playing behind closed doors, but after everything this nightmare has provoked. We have to be in the best physical condition</p>
