<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney is being backed to keep Manchester United and Everton waiting for at least another year]</b> I think he might possibly just stay on for even another year, maybe two more. If they’re offering the amounts of money that can be offered down in England then it would be a huge temptation but we’ve seen in the past how much he loves the football club and he’s still only young. If he holds out another year or two, I think opportunities do open up. Someone like Man United, that has been touted with the struggles that they have found at left-back. Certainly, if they were the ones tabling the bid, you would jump. I think you would have to jump to go to a Manchester United or the likes of them in the Champions League competitions. Everton, outside the top six clubs, you would argue are probably the next one<br /><br />It really depends on Kieran Tierney himself for me at this point. Celtic as a football club, I don’t think they’ll want to lose him but it certainly tests their resolve - if £25 million is slapped on to the table, that’s a hard amount to say ‘no’ to and then I think pretty much it’ll be in the player’s hands. People are going to go mad when I say there’s still a question mark on Kieran Tierney, especially at that level. The physicality and the pace of the game down there is completely night and day from what you get week in, week out here. I think he’s more than willing, more than capable, to go and rise to that test. It’s not so much him, it’s what he’s up against. It’s the bigger physical specimen that he’s going to come up against</p>
