  <p><b>[The European Championship is widely regarded as the tougher tournament]</b> I don’t agree with that. Countries like Argentina and Brazil, they are very tough. In the group stages, it’s more difficult to go to the second round. In 2008, we played France, Italy and Romania. It was also a very difficult group and this time it will be the same. If you want to be the best, you’ve got to beat the best. That’s what it’s all about<br /><br /><b>[Holland play all their group matches in Kharkiv, Ukraine, but have based themselves in Krakow, Poland. Van der Vaart and Kuyt shrugged off the possible impact of flying to and from games]</b> These players are used to travel. It’s more important to have good accommodation and also to have a good training pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Dirk Kuyt tells that he almost missed the 2007 <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League Final]</b> Out of nowhere, <a href="peter-crouch.html">Peter Crouch</a> drove straight at me at roughly 35 mph. He couldn’t brake! The only thing I could do was to jump in the air, and in the end I just managed to jump over Peter, and he crashed into cardboard boxes behind me. I was within a whisker of having my ankles torn to pieces, and would surely have missed the Champions League final. It was incredible that I saw him just in time and could jump over him! Crouchy’s face was as pale as death, he’d had some kind of blackout. Fortunately everything was all right</p>

To me, this feels like the right time to retire. I have had two fantastic years here since returning to Feyenoord, with this season’s title as the absolute pinnacle. I had the dream of winning trophies and becoming a champion with Feyenoord. All my dreams have come true</p>

  <p><b>[Dirk Kuyt says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a perfect team]</b> Absolutely. Everyone is in tune. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s ideas are perfect. It really looks like the players are doing exactly what they want from them. From the moment he arrived, he had a very clear idea of ​​what he wanted. And all big projects, big ideas require time. The club allowed <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> to set up this team, he was given enough time to do it. The puzzle is complete. They failed to win the Premier League but finished second with a bewildering number of points. I’m already excited to see next season. Every year there is progress. This may be the beginning of a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team that will be remembered forever. If they can start with the Champions League, then maybe the Premier League next year, they will most likely become one of the best <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams ever seen.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward Dirk Kuyt has named the ‘most special player he has ever played with during his career’]</b> I have been able to play with many big players at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

He was the captain of the team and he was the first to put me at ease. Not a man of many words, but he shook my hand and said, ‘I hope I will win a lot of prizes with you here’. In the period that followed I saw how he took the lead as a captain and what it meant to be a real professional. A number of things stood out. As a top player you have to be good every day, thinks Gerrard<br /><br />So he also gave everything every day, not only on Saturday afternoons or on Champions League evenings, but from Monday to Friday he led the fight. He wanted to be the best every day. With that he gave the team much more than with lengthy speeches. If it went well, but especially if it went bad. Everyone was drawn to him and so did I.</p>

  <p><b>[Dirk Kuyt talks about the 2008-09 squad]</b> We were very close to success. we just missed a small detail to go one step further.

We were a particular team like that, only we couldn’t go one step further at that time. Hopefully this team will do it because, in my opinion, this team now on the pitch is even better than ours<br /><br /><b>[Kuyt himself played a starring role in several of the heated clashes over the years and hopes his former side can notch another victory against their rivals this weekend]</b> You can always feel the rivalry between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United. We know the derby, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, is a massive game for the people in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But Liverpool-United or United-Liverpool is one of the biggest games in England and I always loved to play in them, we had many good results back in the day. For me, the highs were the hat-trick against United and also a late winner in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. I always really enjoyed those kinds of games. I always look forward to watching the game because it’s an absolute joy to watch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the moment. These are special games and make you just a little bit more excited than the other games</p>
