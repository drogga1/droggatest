  <p><b>[The European Championship is widely regarded as the tougher tournament]</b> I don’t agree with that. Countries like Argentina and Brazil, they are very tough. In the group stages, it’s more difficult to go to the second round. In 2008, we played France, Italy and Romania. It was also a very difficult group and this time it will be the same. If you want to be the best, you’ve got to beat the best. That’s what it’s all about<br /><br /><b>[Holland play all their group matches in Kharkiv, Ukraine, but have based themselves in Krakow, Poland. Van der Vaart and Kuyt shrugged off the possible impact of flying to and from games]</b> These players are used to travel. It’s more important to have good accommodation and also to have a good training pitch</p>

He couldn’t brake! The only thing I could do was to jump in the air, and in the end I just managed to jump over Peter, and he crashed into cardboard boxes behind me. I was within a whisker of having my ankles torn to pieces, and would surely have missed the Champions League final. It was incredible that I saw him just in time and could jump over him! Crouchy’s face was as pale as death, he’d had some kind of blackout. Fortunately everything was all right</p>

  <p><b>[Dirk Kuyt finished his career in the top six of goalscorers in the league]</b> There are players who can change the course of a match with a single touch and others who are there to serve the team. I have no problem admitting I’m in the second category. I try to do what I can to win each match. I’m a battler. Every match is equally important to me, and if you win all the time, the titles will eventually come.</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk would suit Liverpool very well]</b> I know Virgil. I didn’t play with him in the national team but he’s a great player. We’ll see how things will go in the winter break or at the end of the season. I don’t think it’s strange for me to say he is a player who will suit Liverpool very well. He has the right mentality and he is a great defender. He could do a great job at Liverpool but it’s not for me to say if he would be an improvement or not. That’s up to the club.<br /><br />I think the Liverpool team now has great players but if you want to be contenders for titles then you have to have more than 11 good players</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are developing and will pick up many points during a positive festive period]</b> Liverpool playing at Anfield should always be favourites. It doesn’t matter which side is coming to Anfield. With the supporters and the crowd behind them they should always be favourites and they should always play the game to win it and I’m sure they will play the match like that. Liverpool and Chelsea are both very good teams. But I think Liverpool especially is developing. What I can see from Liverpool now is that they are growing. They are in a very interesting part of the season and I’m quite confident that the side can get many points during Christmas and get many wins.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s fall guy Dejan Lovren is ready to shake off his critics and star this season in the team’s defence]</b> Lovren is a great guy. I am big Liverpool fan, follower on social, and I saw Dejan joined the team. He will have a great season and I believe Liverpool can fight Man City for the title this season. I enjoyed watching Croatia at the World Cup and how passionate they fought, not giving up for one second. They deserved a little more, but France are a terrific team and reaching the final is, in itself, amazing.<br /><br />With Feyenoord I’ve won the title after 18 years, I believe Liverpool will make it after 29 years and Lovren will be a very important part of it. He and my friend <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk make a great defensive wall<br /><br />I know how <b>[Mateo]</b> Kovacic feels, sometimes it is hard to be patient, everyone wants to play. I was such a player myself, always wanting to play, me and Mateo are similar for that. Real are one of the best clubs in the world but Chelsea are also a top club, with a new team preparing and a big opportunity for Kovacic to prove if he finishes there. <b>[Luka]</b> Modric has had a great season with Real and a great World Cup, he is no doubt the best midfielder in the world, but I am especially surprised by his character. After he missed a penalty against Denmark and than took the shot in shoot-out and scored - only the biggest players can do something like that, can have the guts to do that. I hope he wins the Ballon d’Or</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah feels happy at Liverpool]</b> It’s amazing. I talked to him on Wednesday after the game <b>[against Red Star]</b> - he is such a nice guy. Everybody can see when they are watching in the stadium or on television that he is a great player; not everyone can see he is a very nice person who is very happy at Anfield at the moment. That’s the most important thing: that he feels respected and that he feels happy at Liverpool Football Club. That’s why he is achieving those kinds of things. Everyone knows he is a fantastic player. The fact he is here, that he is respected and that he is happy counts even more. Hopefully he will be happy for a very long time here. Wednesday was the first time I met him in person; I respected him already as a player but as a human even more now.<br /><br />The partnership between <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino and Mo makes the difference. Mo is very happy with Firmino, he is the type of striker who doesn’t live by goals - he lives by playing football, winning games and winning together. That has made it a pleasure for Mo to play with these kinds of players, who are not selfish and who know how to bring Salah into positions to score. It’s all because of that connection, especially with the players up front who know what to do and know in which kinds of positions they need to bring Salah. He made a great goal and also a good penalty<br /><br />When I arrived at Liverpool there was a hope to win the league. Now that hope is changing and people start to believe Liverpool can win the league. That’s what football is all about: that you believe in the success you can have with your team. The supporters are starting to believe it’s possible to win the league again. It’s a long way but that’s the first step. You have to believe you can do it. With Feyenoord we had the same situation, a little bit shorter but for 18 years we didn’t win the league title. From the first day we started the competition we believed in winning the league and that’s what I felt on Wednesday - that people are not hoping for success but believing in success for Liverpool. That’s a massive step forward</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are handling the pressure of a Premier League title bid]</b> The pressure is always high in football, especially at Liverpool Football Club. But if you see the team, the way they cope with pressure so far, they score goals when they have to score goals. For example, a few months ago, the last-minute goal against Everton, or the last game against Fulham - 1-1, it was not easy to turn that game into a 2-1 win and that’s when you can see a team can handle pressure. Liverpool at the moment are handling the pressure. At the end of the day, the season will be decided by very small details and that will make the difference to win or to lose. I don’t think I have to tell that to the players or to the coaching staff because they all have great experience and they know what it’s all about. All I can say is that I wish them all the best and great luck and I will support them from Holland<br /><br />Their strength is the team itself and they’re working and fighting together and that’s more than 11 players. Players who are coming in, players who are not playing every game, once they come in the game they can make a difference. All I can say is that I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to the next couple of months for Liverpool because so far I think they deserve a lot this season and let’s see how far they can go</p>

In the period that followed I saw how he took the lead as a captain and what it meant to be a real professional. A number of things stood out. As a top player you have to be good every day, thinks Gerrard<br /><br />So he also gave everything every day, not only on Saturday afternoons or on Champions League evenings, but from Monday to Friday he led the fight. He wanted to be the best every day. With that he gave the team much more than with lengthy speeches. If it went well, but especially if it went bad. Everyone was drawn to him and so did I.</p>
