<blockquote>
  <p>[Marcus Sorg said he felt ‘strange’ to be in charge of Germany against Belarus with head coach <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> unable to attend the Euro 2020 qualifier. Germany boss Low could not travel to Saturday’s qualifier after suffering a ‘contused artery’ while exercising last month] It was a bit strange after such a long time. I have not looked at my phone yet to see if anyone has sent messages. It was essential to win - and we did it. It was important to me to overcome difficulties and win. It was important, that the boys had to go to their limit. It was an impressive performance. We had to deal with a deep-lying opponent, but overall it was totally fine. We wanted to go to the opponent’s goal by quickly winning the ball - and that’s how we did it.</p>
