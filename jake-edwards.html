<blockquote>
  <p>[The USL feels its achievement of second-division status in the U.S. Soccer pyramid is validation of hard work] It’s something we’ve been working on for a good two years. It was a big component to a strategic larger-term plan. We’ve held back on a couple of initiatives, specifically around broadcasting, commercial and strategic partnerships domestically and internationally until we had the Division II sanctioning, because we felt that was going to give us a platform to launch some of those initiatives in a better way or a more successful way than at a third division level. It’s validation of the investment and hard work of the club owners over the last number of years.<br /><br />When you’re going into media rights space or national commercial partnerships, or even strategic partnerships with other leagues and clubs around the world, when you’re talking about attracting quality players and coaches, the perception of differentiation between a third and second division, even if it’s not a merit-based structure or pro-rel, it’s still there<br /><br />We’ve spent a lot of time looking at it and researching it with outside agencies and working with our clubs. It has a real tangible benefit in terms of franchise value, the ability to monetize the different revenue levels, generate income through sponsorship, ticket sales, attendance and all that. All those things, it does have an effect on the ability to continue to make investment, from an ownership point of view, into infrastructure<br /><br />We’ve focused on trying to deliver professional soccer in the most excitable, sustainable and honest way we can. That’s all we can do. We’ve worked hard to meet all these standards. There’s still a couple of things we need to work on and we’re going to be focused on that over the next 12 months and we’ll be working with the federation. But the rest of that stuff is out of our hands, so we’re just focused on what we’re doing</p>
