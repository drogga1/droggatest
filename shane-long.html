  <p><b>[Shane Long is looking forward to another cup meeting with Arsenal after firing Southampton into the fourth round of the FA Cup]</b> We always seem to meet them in the cup but it’s going to be a great game. Hopefully it will be a big turn-out and the fans will get us through that one as it’s always a tough one. They’re a good side and I think they might make a few changes as well, which they normally do, and it could be an evenly contested game.<br /><br />We’re still in with a shout by keeping ourselves in the competition and we’ll still take every game as it comes. Next is Leicester, though, and we’re badly due a win in the league</p>

  <p><b>[Shane Long has admitted that he instantly knew his Republic of Ireland team-mate Seamus Coleman was badly hurt after an horrific challenge by Wales’ Neil Taylor]</b> It’s not nice, you know? I was just trying to comfort him on the pitch. It was disappointing after that when we went down to 10 men to not kick on and get the three points. A point isn’t a bad result. We’re still sat nicely in the group, so it’s all to play for. I was just trying to comfort him.He was obviously in a lot of pain. It was a bad challenge, a bad injury. I was just trying to settle him and relax him. It’s not nice to see that happen to anybody. I think everybody love Seamus. It’s hard to see when he goes down like that, but I’m sure he’ll come back fitter and stronger.<br /><br /><b>[Long refused to condemn Friday’s match officials for failing to send Gareth Bale off]</b> He caught <b>[John O’Shea]</b> high. I think that was honest as well, he was trying to get the ball and score a goal. He did catch him, catch him high. Even afterwards with the kick in the chest on James McClean. Little things like that, if they go your way, they can change the game. I don’t think there was any malice in it. I thought the ref did alright tonight. He let things go and tried to keep it fair for both sides</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso has been handed a three-match ban by the FA]</b> Marcos Alonso will miss Chelsea’s next three matches after an Independent Regulatory Commission ruled he had committed an act of violent conduct against Southampton’s Shane Long. Alonso denied the charge and further submitted that if found proven the suspension would be excessive, however, this was rejected following Wednesday’s hearing. The incident, which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video, occurred in the 43rd minute of Saturday’s game.</p>

  <p><b>[What is the fastest goal in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history?]</b> The manager said to have a quick start and put them under pressure. Ninety-nine times out of 100 you don’t block them, but it fell nicely. I took a touch across him and - Ben is a good keeper, he spreads himself well - I knew before the game that the dink was a good finish against him and luckily it came off</p>
