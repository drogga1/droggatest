  <p><b>[Anthony Gordon reflects on his breakthrough year]</b> I wasn’t surprised that I started because I’d been working really hard in lockdown. I was expecting to play. I was really confident in myself and the manager showed his trust in me. It was an idea that me and my friends had that I wouldn’t let lockdown go to waste by losing any fitness or any shape. I wanted to get that edge that could possibly turn me into a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player. It was massive for me to do that and I pushed myself as much as I could. I was up early mornings doing two to three sessions a day and I really enjoyed it as it pushed me to my limits. It was like an army camp and there was no rest. My mentality grew so much from doing that. I can’t even describe how much more mature I am just because of that short space of time<br /><br /><b>[Five <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> players featured in Paul Simpson’s squad - <a href="dominic-calvert-lewin.html">Dominic Calvert-Lewin</a>, <a href="ademola-lookman.html">Ademola Lookman</a>, <a href="jonjoe-kenny.html">Jonjoe Kenny</a>, Kieran Dowell and Callum Connolly - and Gordon admits seeing the success of his older peers at international level was a major source of inspiration]</b> It was incredible to watch them achieve one of the best honours in football even though it’s at a youth level - it’s a World Cup, and it was really inspiring to watch them. They were in a similar position to me, only a couple of years older, so to see them go on to achieve what they did as <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> players gives me the confidence that I could go on and achieve the same if I have the right mentality and work rate<br /><br />As a youth team player, the more managers you can learn from the better. Every manager has a different style and a different philosophy on how a player should be. They each have their own tactical side of the game, and all the managers I’ve worked under have been really different. I had Paul Tait at U18 level as my manager when I was promoted to make my debut for the first team against Limassol. He was all about portraying how good I was - he was the first-ever manager to tell me that. I thank him for that as he was the first to really build my own confidence up. Then I went on to <a href="david-unsworth.html">David Unsworth</a>, which was the complete opposite: he didn’t care if you were a talented player or not, he was really hard and pushed me to my limits. Pre-seasons with him were really tough and the seasons themselves as he’s the type that’s always testing your mentality to see how you react. This improves your tactical awareness and prepares you for the demands of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and you mature much quicker. With Paul Simpson at England U19 level, he’s a really good coach. At national level, I find the coaching is a lot more tactical and based on possession because the England age-group set-up is really strong<br /><br />Looking over the years, there’s been a lot of academy prospects that have come through. There was <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a>, <a href="jonjoe-kenny.html">Jonjoe Kenny</a>, Tom Davies, Kieran Dowell … so to see them come through from a similar position to me was massive. When Marcel came in, I sat down and spoke with him quite a lot. He took a real interest in me which I really enjoyed and it made me feel wanted and a bit more confident about myself. It felt at the time when I signed the new deal that the club was on the up, and it still is. Hopefully we can keep improving as a club and push together. I understand as a local lad what it means to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fans and what they want to see in an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> player. I notice that and I’ll try my best to give them as much as I can<br /><br />Leighton Baines and <a href="seamus-coleman.html">Seamus Coleman</a> have been huge mentors for me because I feel they both take a good amount of interest in me. They really help me on a daily basis, and Seamus is a really good captain. He’s very vocal and he’ll tell me both when I’m doing really well and also when I can improve. Leighton is a massive leader in a much different way as he’s not a loud or a big talker. He’s just a really composed individual who leads through his qualities. As a footballer, I think if you do all the right things off the pitch, it gives you trust in yourself, and it makes things a lot easier. I’m someone who doesn’t like to drink, I don’t eat badly, my diet is really good and I’m a boring person, really. I do little hobbies like basketball, snooker and cards but I’m never out drinking. I pride myself on being really professional for a young player<br /><br /><b>[Gordon prefers to read in his spare time, and is currently engrossed in Dr Steve Peters’ The Chimp Paradox, which provides a mind management programme that helps elite athletes to conquer their fears and operate with control, focus and confidence]</b> It’s teaching me that people can have two voices in their heads - the good voice and the bad voice - so it’s about how to balance them and deal with that<br /><br /><b>[When asked about playing on the left]</b> Being the No 10 is still my preferred position as it’s where I played all the way through my youth career and it’s where I see myself playing in the future. But, as I’ve got older, I’ve built up speed, power and strength so I can play on the wings as well so it doesn’t really bother me. I just love playing<br /><br />It’s hard to put a finger on one area that I’m focusing on improving. I’m looking to get better at the little details in the final third, scoring and assisting, and finding better positions in between defenders and midfielders. I actually find it hard to believe how much I have improved in the past couple of months, just working with him <b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>]</b>. He makes football seem so simple. As a young player, you sometimes over-complicate things, but he simplifies things right down to the ground. It makes it much easier for me to understand certain tactics or positions I should be taking up<br /><br />I want to play as many minutes as possible and I want us to win every game. We’re not just going to let the season fizzle out. We’re a big club, and the fans deserve to see us winning. On a personal level, I’d love to get my first goal and I’m really looking for that. I’ll be trying as much as I can to get that but I’ll also be looking to assist my team-mates as that’s what I love to do<br /><br />We’re professional players, we lost a game and it was a poor performance. But we’ve moved on and the next day in training, the spirit was high. We’re a strong, together group which means we can move on fast and react to that result against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. Carlo wants us to show more personality by getting on the ball, making more forward passes, driving forward and not just being safe. In other areas, he’s told us not to be afraid to be aggressive and tackle like an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> player should</p>
