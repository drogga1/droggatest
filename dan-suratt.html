<blockquote>
  <p><b>[A+E now owns part of the NWSL - what does it mean for the league?]</b> When we started to talk more about what the league’s aspirations were, where they saw the business going and what the opportunities were with the league, it made more sense for us to think about it from a larger perspective.<br /><br /><b>[Regarding A+E’s investment in the NWSL, which will give his company two seats on the league’s board]</b> We don’t own a majority but it is a significant stake in the league<br /><br /><b>[So what did A+E see in NWSL that warranted purchasing a stake in the league?]</b> If you look at it from the outside, this is the first <b>[American]</b> women’s soccer league ever to make it past the third season so when we first started having conversations, they were preparing for their fourth season which was record breaking in some regards. When you look at all these opportunities of how the league could grow, whether through increased sponsorships, repetitive broadcasting or expansion, all of those things could lead to this league really becoming a staple of women’s professional sports in the U.S. if not the world overall<br /><br />We are investors in companies and this is one that we saw as having an enormous growth opportunity and one where we can strategically align to help it grow. It’s clearly got an opportunity to really resonate on a larger scale but it has not gotten a lot of attention. That’s not because the level of play isn’t good enough, it’s because they haven’t had the spotlight shone on them enough yet and that’s what we really hope to be able to do<br /><br />I would expect that we will figure out creative ways to work together to promote the league</p>
