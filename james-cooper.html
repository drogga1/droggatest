  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho and <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> give <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> options]</b> We’ve got to improve the ones we’ve got here but we will never stand still. You can’t think, ‘we’ve cracked this’. The emphasis is on improving the team all the time. I don’t think you can have too many good players at a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> would be a statement signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He’s someone that would allow them to rotate, in the same way as having an attacking midfielder like <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> <br /><br />Yes, <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> may not start games for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, because your first choices might be <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Fernandes, but if you look at <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> over the past couple of seasons you’re not going to get 30-40 games out of him because he doesn’t do that for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he has these injury problems which mean he’s not consistently there. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> knows <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> really, really well. The two of them are friends. And that’s a really fearsome looking strike line-up<br /><br />And the other thing about it is, <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> could well play No10 behind the trident. If you wanted to do that and give <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> a rest, you could have <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Nemanja Matic</a> supporting <b>[Greenwood]</b> and him pulling some of the strings, in the same way even <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> could<br /><br /><a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> also has the ability to play across the frontline. We saw him playing for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> at the weekend and he dropped in at No10, he played No9 towards the end of the game and he can go on the left or the right. That versatility - much like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> who can play across that frontline as well - just gives <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> all those options.<br /><br />Certainly in terms of money, <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> is a deal <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> can do pretty easily with the finances they have. With <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>, they’re going to have to get a bit more creative. I don’t think we’re going to see a £100m transfer fee. There’s going to be some money down, there might be players involved, there might be sell-ons or buy-ons, just to protect them and give <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> the kind of money they deserve. Before COVID-19 I think everyone looked at it and thought that’s a £100m signing. But I don’t think anyone is writing a £100m cheque at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for one player.<br /><br />If Villa go down, he goes. That’s a shoo-in. If Villa survive, it’s going to be up to <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a>. I can’t see Villa standing in his way if he does want to go - but they will drive a hard bargain. In all honesty, I think he will go, even if Villa survive. He’s a Champions League player, he’s an England player in the making - and Villa are light years away from the Europa League, let alone the Champions League. I don’t think Villa fans are going to begrudge him a move. He’s earned it. As long as he’s honest with the fans and he doesn’t leave in the same way that <a href="fabian-delph.html">Fabian Delph</a> left a few years ago, he’ll get the well wishes of Villa fans</p>
