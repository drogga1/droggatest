  <p><b>[Juan Miranda, who made his senior squad debut against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in December, says the chance to work alongside the likes of <a href="jordi-alba.html">Jordi Alba</a> offers invaluable insight into his role and what’s required at the highest level]</b> I am so grateful that Valverde allows me to work with the first team. I pay particular attention to <a href="jordi-alba.html">Jordi Alba</a>’s movements because he plays in my position. But I try to watch the whole team. I learn from every single player, how they apply pressure, how they attack and how they defend. It is a very complex team to understand!</p>
