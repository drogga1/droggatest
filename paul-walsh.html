  <p><b>[Victims of paedophile Bill Kenneally want Fianna Fail, the Catholic church and Gardai to be investigated over the abuse. Paul Walsh, claims when he was 14 two gardai approached him and warned him to stay away from Kenneally]</b> Back in 1987 when a guard stopped me in the pub and told me that there was a file ‘as long as your arm’ in the station about him, I actually thought fair play to him. At the time I was 14 and I naively thought that meant that it was all going to stop<br /><br />I was told by two separate gardai a paedophilia video was found in the search. But in the court case the detective said nothing of a paedophilia nature was found. The two gardai that I gave my statement to, however, told me that they found a video tape wrapped up in Sellotape and I even know who the victim was on that video and I know that he was a minor when Kenneally made that video of him. I want to know why they withheld this from the DPP.<br /><br />And also about a month before the trial the gardai told me there is a chance that this man, who abused and tortured me, could walk away from a jail sentence. sAll because there was no evidence to prove that he had continued abusing after 1987 when they let him go from the station but all that time they held the piece of evidence that proved he did</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Walsh believes that Alli is more influential than N’Golo Kante]</b> It would be my dream pairing, those two in the middle of the midfield, maybe in a three with another player in there. If I had to pick one, though, I’d be with Alan <b>[Smith]</b> a little bit because scoring goals and creating chances is the hardest thing in football. He <b>[Alli]</b> does that. Kante is brilliant at what he does but you’d like to think that you could maybe get someone close to him, maybe not as good as him but close to do a decent job..</p>
