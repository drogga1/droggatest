  <p><b>[When asked how his rehab was]</b> It was tough. I couldn’t do what I love doing most and had to work my way back instead. Running on a treadmill in front of a mirror isn’t as fun as being out on the pitch with the team. You’ve just got to get through it.<br /><br />Normally, I always try to get straight back up on my feet and carry on when I’m fouled as I don’t want to get substituted! However, in that moment, I thought I’d really seriously injured myself. Thankfully, it wasn’t as bad as I first feared. What really helped was the support I received from my teammates. The whole team asked after me and wanted to know how I was getting on. Leon <b>[Goretzka]</b> surprised me when I had my MRI scan and came along with me. Naldo, Breel <b>[Embolo]</b> and Thilo <b>[Kehrer]</b> kept asking me how I’m doing and that was great. It helped me concentrate on my rehabilitation<br /><br />I feel great. I’ve been able to train fully for the first time this week and I feel like a brand-new player. Maybe the injury has actually turned me into a better player</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic and McKennie battle in Revierderby]</b> The feeling’s amazing. It’s my second derby, the first one we tied 4-4, that was also an amazing feeling. But to be here in, our home stadium, and all the families and the fans and everyone, just the atmosphere. It’s something that you can’t get everywhere, and I feel like it’s only here at Schalke that you can get it, especially in the derby win.</p>

I started playing like that, I fell in love with the sport: the culture, the fans, how big it is over there, how they support it in Europe<br /><br />I feel very much at home here. I would never have come close to going anywhere else, if I was to know how perfect Schalke was going to be for me.<br /><br />I’m always going to dance, I’m always going to sing.

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie set for first USMNT match as teammates]</b> We’ve talked about <b>[playing together]</b> a lot. think one of the biggest things is I think we’ll be on the same page quicker than later because we both play in the Bundesliga. Our chemistry is unreal. I’ve known him since I was 13 years old. I see him twice, maybe three times a week. If we end up on the same pitch against Bolivia I think it will be a good connection. He’s more of the offensive type, I’m more of the defensive type. I think it’ll be a good balance. Me give him balls, let him do his thing, create, and I think it will fit better than expected.<br /><br />I think I’ll take a little bit more risks here than I do at Schalke. In Schalke, I know my role. Here, I know my role. In Schalke, you know which players are good at what. I’m not going to try and step in and be the next <b>[Schalke playmaker]</b> Amine Harit because Amine is the way he is. He’s good at what he does. Here, I think I have a little bit more room to be able to say, ‘OK, I’m a six, but I also have another six next to me, I can be the one to go forward. I can take the initiative to do that. I think I’ll probably try to get more into the attack and maybe create some combinations with Christian</p>

  <p><b>[Breakout Bundesliga season has McKennie primed for big USMNT role]</b> Me and my agent <b>[former U.S. defender Cory Gibbs]</b>, whenever we see each other, we think about how far we’ve come. It’s something that I do look back and I say, ‘I’ve come a long way’. But it’s also a motivation because it can’t stop here. There’s always more. I want to see if I can make it to the next level, and the next level, and keep going further.<br /><br /><b>[On Domenico Tedesco]</b> He put it in my head that tactically if we do everything correct we can beat any team. He opened my mind up a lot, and I think that’s also what separates our team from any other teams tactically defensively. We’re one of the best in Europe. He makes you feel valuable even though you’re maybe not the one doing the goal-scoring and assisting. He makes sure that you know that you’re important for the tactics and the role in the team<br /><br />My composure and my concentration level had to be higher than what it normally was, and being around players day in and day out, on and off the field, helped. With players like Naldo, and people behind me, and even though I’m young I got wiser in my positioning, realizing that chasing a 40-yard ball when I can maybe move 10 yards another way is conserving a lot more energy, so I think my positioning got better definitely. I still knock out probably 12 or 13 kilometers per game, but it saves me energy so I can tough it out at the end of games<br /><br />I got a sense a day after that, for the U.S. fans, it was kind of a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately we didn’t qualify for the World Cup, but hopefully that game gave them a little sense of what could happen for the next cycle<br /><br />I think it still hasn’t hit me. I think whenever it comes time to start preparing for the next season it’ll hit me more. Being able to say I get to play Champions League next year, maybe against Ronaldo or Messi or all the other greats around the world is a dream come true. I’ve always watched it on TV and just hearing the Champions League song and then walking out, and the crowd, the atmosphere, the way it’s set up. Directly after we qualified for it, I was like, ‘Oh God, we actually play Champions League next year’. Nobody would have bet on it at the beginning of the season. Nobody would have put one Euro on Schalke besides the Schalke fans. Nobody would have ever said Schalke would finish in a Champions League spot, let alone the top two<br /><br />My first year I also I don’t think many people would have thought I would have made it into the roster the way I did, how quickly I did. I don’t really expect anything for next season. Leon Goretzka told me one time, ‘When you expect things they always come different so you can’t expect anything’. Next year, yeah, of course there’s going to be more competition, but it’s not going to be much different as what I had the first season and look where it got me. I’m confident in my abilities. I’m confident in the coach being confident in me. I played what, 25 matches this season? I don’t think most people would have thought that either<br /><br />I use it as motivation to try and get better every day so I can look back and nobody can say that this was a lucky year. I want to show that I’ve deserved this and I deserve more</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic gives those around him a confidence boost]</b> We’ve been pretty good lately, but I think we need a little bit more creativity in the final third, and a few more players who like to go one-on-one with players. Christian is the type of player, when you see him out wide with the ball, you know he’s going to get by the player 95 per cent of the time. He’ll find a way. That’s something that will definitely help our team and give us a little confidence boost. There are always players that whenever they’re on the field with you, you feel comfortable with. Players you can count on, players you just believe in a little bit more. Christian is one of those players.<br /><br />Many people are going into these games thinking, ‘OK, they’re going to get blown away,’ or, ‘It’s England, they just almost won the World Cup, and it’s Italy, a powerhouse’, but going into these games as young players, it’s definitely a good experience to get that under our belt and use it to progress for the future. It’s not every day you get to play against England in London at Wembley Stadium and against Italy. It’s a really big opportunity for us to show what the USA can do, and for me to show myself on a really big stage</p>

  <p><b>[Weston McKennie excited for ‘big experience’ of facing England at Wembley]</b> Definitely, a lot. To be able to see where we are at compared to these type of countries. We have played a lot of great countries in the past such as Brazil, France and even Ireland. I think everyone respects the Premier League and most of these players play in it. It will be a good match and a big experience for us.<br /><br /><b>[on Christian Pulisic]</b> I guess to see him was a big stepping stone for a lot of young players in America. Many of us looked at him and saw it is possible for us to make that move. There are success stories because before a lot of people looked at us American soccer players who moved over to these European clubs and thought we stayed there for a year and then didn’t hear about us ever again. So he is definitely one of those players who showed a positive side to it and how it could be a success, if it worked out for you. It is a big inspiration</p>

So I felt like there’s no better way and no better time than now. I wouldn’t even say that it was surprising, but it definitely was sickening. When a man of that age cries out for his mother, his dead mother, he’s essentially crying out ‘please help me’. He knows that he’s not going to make it out. It’s hard to watch. Many of my teammates here saw it and are also disgusted. It’s something that touches you in a different way. It’s too much and it needs to be brought to attention. It needs to stop. There are too many social injustices and too many police brutality incidences where they say ‘it’s an accident’. An accident happens once or twice, but when it’s happened so many times like it has now, it can’t be overlooked anymore</p>

  <p><b>[McKennie also added that he did not speak to the club before donning the armband, admitting that he should have, while the American star added that he was asked by the referee to remove the armband during the match]</b> I was like, ‘I’m not taking it off’. There’s a rule in the league that you can’t make political statements. But I mean, if you really, really look at this as a political statement, then I don’t know what to tell you. The league and everyone (in soccer) always preaches ‘say no to racism’. So I didn’t think that there would be a problem. If I have to take the consequences to express my opinion, to express my feelings, to stand up for what I believe in, then that’s something that I have to do. My message for those people is that, yeah, we’re athletes, but we’re humans first. I know that I will continue to pay tribute to George Floyd in some way and not just him, but for the many senseless deaths that have happened in these situations. I believe that athletes have one of the biggest platforms to influence and if their followers don’t like what they believe in, they don’t have to follow them. If they don’t like what they believe in, they don’t have to support them. But I shouldn’t have to change what I believe in and what my opinion is, based on the people that follow me. It doesn’t work like that</p>

  <p><b>[Weston McKennie says <a href="donald-trump.html">President Donald Trump</a> a racist and ignorant]</b> In my eyes, he can be called racist. I don’t think Trump is the right man for the job of president. I don’t think he understands his responsibility to the entire country. I think he’s ignorant. I don’t support him one bit. I don’t think he’s a man of his word.<br /><br /><b>[McKennie, who has earned 19 USMNT caps since making his debut in 2017, has stated that he plans to continue speaking out against racism]</b> Basically, it’s important that we athletes are also committed to the fight against racism, because we have the exposure. That’s why it’s up to all of us</p>
