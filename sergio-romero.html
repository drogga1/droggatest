  <p><b>[Sergio Romero has set his sights on a second Europa League crown as <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> await their fate in the 2019-20 group stage draw]</b> In this competition, it’s always uncertain because of the short and long journeys to different places. It will be a challenge to try to repeat the victory again in this competition. This club always needs to do well, wherever we play. My experience tells me that, in these competitions, there are no easy teams and also that nobody is going to give you anything for free. It is a competition where, to reach the final, it is going to be very difficult, but we will give our best. I do not have any team, in particular, I would like to play against. When you play in Europe, every team is going to be a difficult one. There are no easy teams in European competitions. Every team who participates in this competition wants to do well and wants to win. The team, the players, everyone wants to play in European competition and, of course, wants to win it<br /><br /><b>[The 32-year-old went on to describe just how much winning the Europa League meant to him last time around]</b> The victory, for me, was a massive relief because I wasn’t playing a lot in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and other competitions. I only played in the cup and thanks to the confidence the manager deposited in me, it was a very positive thing for me. Also, scoring first – it was very important. Overall, it was a really nice final<br /><br /><b>[The Argentina international serves in a number two role behind <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, but a lack of regular minutes on the pitch has not dampened his resolve]</b> We have a great team, we have a great manager and everyone at this club wants to do well. This is another year, another season where we start from zero and we have to be at our best. This club, because of its history, deserves to win always. We, as a team, have to work very hard, help each other and go the extra mile. September is going to be a very busy month with all the Premier Leagues matches, this cup and other competitions. For the players like me, who don’t play that often, it’s going to be a really good challenge to prove to our manager that we are ready to compete and to help when the team needs it</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero faces fierce competition for places at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> from <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, but the Argentine is planning to stick around at Old Trafford and keeping winning things here]</b> I’m 32 now and I train like I was just 20. Even though I’m 32 I train and put in the same effort as I did when I was just 20 full of the hopes of making a career as a professional player. I haven’t changed at all, in anything, and let’s hope that in the years I have left at the club I can show the fans that I’m still here and able to do a job and that I feel very much at ease and very happy at this club. And I want to try and keep winning things here<br /><br /><b>[He is rightly proud of that record, with his hard work being rewarded as he prepares to step back in for a Europa League meeting with Partizan Belgrade on Thursday]</b> It makes me feel relaxed, and it makes me happy too. In spite of not playing so regularly, the sheer hard work you put in every single day is still there. We all work extremely hard - myself and <a href="lee-grant.html">Lee Grant</a> alongside David De Gea - every single day. We know that we are fit and ready to play whenever we are called upon. The fact that I have kept a clean sheet in roughly half or just over half of however many games makes me feel really pleased and gives me peace of mind. It makes me believe that anything can happen and that all I have to do is keep working hard and wait for my opportunities</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero insists he is happy at the best club in the world despite a lack of regular minutes]</b> It’s not easy. But I work every day for this chance to play and then I am ready when it comes. In the last four years, I was in a difficult situation. I work every day for the chance and if I have my chance I try to do my best. I work hard and I am at the best club in the world. I said I wanted to play for United one day when I was younger and now I worked to get my chance. When I got the chance to come to United I knew I accepted that I would be playing a few games but when you get the chance to wear this shirt it’s a dream come true. It was never the intention to be second choice</p>
