  <p><b>[Sergio Romero is ready to step back out of David de Gea’s shadow at Manchester United]</b> The fact that Jose <b>[Mourinho]</b> allowed me to play in the Europa League <b>[last season]</b> showed the confidence he had in me. I never leave anything to chance. I always work hard to be ready for when my chance comes. My priority is being ready 100 per cent, in good shape both physically and mentally, because I’m not just fighting for many things for my club. I’m also fighting for many things at international level, so I’m someone who has his head in the right place to perform well.<br /><br /><b>[on FA Cup]</b> We know that it’s a tough competition, we know that there are seven other teams who also want to win this weekend and to progress. But we are focused on our work and I’m sure we will be in peak condition. We don’t treat this as a secondary competition, we see it as a competition where we need to get to the final and win it.</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero has confirmed he will stay at Manchester United for the 2017-18 season]</b> I’m staying at Manchester United for now. <b>[United manager]</b> Mourinho worked hard for my renewal until 2022. I can’t leave him now. If United wants to sell me, if they have an offer that it’s useful for the club, they will sell me. But I don’t think that would happen.<br /><br />I spoke with Jorge, I explained the situation and recovery time. I told him that I didn’t have anything broken. I assured him that I would be available in 10 days. Sampaoli and the coaching staff’s time frame is different. They wanted someone who could be there every day and I was taken off the list in four hours. My career with the national team hasn’t finished. I’m working towards my return</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial’s ball control has been likened to Lionel Messi’s]</b> He really is one of the best I’ve seen. I think that the only player in the world, or who I’ve seen, running with the ball as if it’s stuck to his foot, is Leo Messi. He can be going at top speed and the ball is always right on the end of his foot, it never gets far away from his control. That’s why he can do all the things he does. But the thing that Anthony has which is quite similar is when he is running at top speed, he can stop the ball absolutely dead, in a split-second. That is the same as what Messi does. Leo will be running with the ball, on a mazy dribble, and then all of a sudden he’ll stop suddenly and change pace or change speed, or go the other side. Anthony can do that with ease and in fact he has done it many times. He dribbles the ball one way, stops suddenly and then goes the other.<br /><br />Back in 2015, not long after I joined United, I was chatting with Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata. I let them in on a secret. There’s a kid at Monaco. Anthony Martial. For sure, in a short while, you’ll all be talking about him. Anthony was still very young, just a kid - I think he was 17 years old at that time - but you could already see that he was that he was a special player with lots of class and lots of talent. The kid was a natural. You’d just be amazed at the things he would do in the training sessions</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are looking to secure a top-three finish in the Premier League]</b> It’s a really exciting period coming up. We’re battling on all fronts. We’re battling for the top four but if we can make the top three that would be even better. The draw is just around the corner for the Champions League and we can’t wait to find out who we’ll play. And the FA Cup is a really important trophy and it’s a massive match coming up this Saturday at Wolves, but we’ll go there and give everything we’ve got. We’ll have our travelling supporters behind us and it’s all about trying to progress in this fantastic competition.<br /><br />We had difficult games away at Arsenal and Chelsea but we managed to perform well in those games. We know it’s another difficult trip down to Wolves but we’re confident and we know this trophy is very important for us. We want to be involved in the very last day that this competition is taking place, ie. get to the final and give ourselves the chance to lift a trophy and make everyone at the club and of course our fans very happy<br /><br />We knew we had our own responsibilities to help change things around and I think that first match, the big 5-1 victory away at Cardiff, was very important. It worked wonders in the sense that it helped us to change our attitude, and showed us we can be confident in our style of play and that we could move forward and show that this is the real United. There was a lot of positivity around the camp and there was a surge in confidence from that day. It’s taken us a long way and you saw how we performed in Paris - the fact that we could go to one of the most difficult venues in the world of football and come away with a massively positive result shows just how far we’ve come</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero said of a first meeting with the man brought back to Manchester as successor to Jose Mourinho in December 2018]</b> I hadn’t worked under Ole before, because I wasn’t around at the club when he was previously here, either coaching younger guys or working with the first team as a striker coach. This was a chance to meet one of my heroes and it was an interesting moment. It was slightly strange but very quickly you forget all of that and think, ‘he’s the boss’. You play it cool!</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero admits that securing major silverware has to be a top target for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2019-20 after enduring two trophyless campaigns]</b> The message is the same as always: we will try to do the best we can, we will try to be better than last season. This year we didn’t win any trophies; next season we want to win a trophy, take the club to the highest position we can. You are already used to us winning and celebrating and we want this too: to keep celebrating and winning and trying to be the best we can.<br /><br />No, the first thing I look at is who we’re playing first, the first game of the season, because that’s the day that we have to aim to be at our best physically and mentally and then after, of course, we look at the derbies, when we’re playing City home and away, or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think every player looks at when we’re going to face the big teams</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero has set his sights on a second Europa League crown as <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> await their fate in the 2019-20 group stage draw]</b> In this competition, it’s always uncertain because of the short and long journeys to different places. It will be a challenge to try to repeat the victory again in this competition. This club always needs to do well, wherever we play. My experience tells me that, in these competitions, there are no easy teams and also that nobody is going to give you anything for free. It is a competition where, to reach the final, it is going to be very difficult, but we will give our best. I do not have any team, in particular, I would like to play against. When you play in Europe, every team is going to be a difficult one. There are no easy teams in European competitions. Every team who participates in this competition wants to do well and wants to win. The team, the players, everyone wants to play in European competition and, of course, wants to win it<br /><br /><b>[The 32-year-old went on to describe just how much winning the Europa League meant to him last time around]</b> The victory, for me, was a massive relief because I wasn’t playing a lot in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and other competitions. I only played in the cup and thanks to the confidence the manager deposited in me, it was a very positive thing for me. Also, scoring first - it was very important. Overall, it was a really nice final<br /><br /><b>[The Argentina international serves in a number two role behind <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, but a lack of regular minutes on the pitch has not dampened his resolve]</b> We have a great team, we have a great manager and everyone at this club wants to do well. This is another year, another season where we start from zero and we have to be at our best. This club, because of its history, deserves to win always. We, as a team, have to work very hard, help each other and go the extra mile. September is going to be a very busy month with all the Premier Leagues matches, this cup and other competitions. For the players like me, who don’t play that often, it’s going to be a really good challenge to prove to our manager that we are ready to compete and to help when the team needs it</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Romero faces fierce competition for places at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> from <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, but the Argentine is planning to stick around at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and keeping winning things here]</b> I’m 32 now and I train like I was just 20. Even though I’m 32 I train and put in the same effort as I did when I was just 20 full of the hopes of making a career as a professional player. I haven’t changed at all, in anything, and let’s hope that in the years I have left at the club I can show the fans that I’m still here and able to do a job and that I feel very much at ease and very happy at this club. And I want to try and keep winning things here<br /><br /><b>[He is rightly proud of that record, with his hard work being rewarded as he prepares to step back in for a Europa League meeting with Partizan Belgrade on Thursday]</b> It makes me feel relaxed, and it makes me happy too. In spite of not playing so regularly, the sheer hard work you put in every single day is still there. We all work extremely hard - myself and <a href="lee-grant.html">Lee Grant</a> alongside David De Gea - every single day. We know that we are fit and ready to play whenever we are called upon. The fact that I have kept a clean sheet in roughly half or just over half of however many games makes me feel really pleased and gives me peace of mind. It makes me believe that anything can happen and that all I have to do is keep working hard and wait for my opportunities</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper Sergio Romero insists he is happy at the best club in the world despite a lack of regular minutes]</b> It’s not easy. But I work every day for this chance to play and then I am ready when it comes. In the last four years, I was in a difficult situation. I work every day for the chance and if I have my chance I try to do my best. I work hard and I am at the best club in the world. I said I wanted to play for United one day when I was younger and now I worked to get my chance. When I got the chance to come to United I knew I accepted that I would be playing a few games but when you get the chance to wear this shirt it’s a dream come true. It was never the intention to be second choice</p>
