  <p><b>[Bill Shankly immediately offered Blackpool £25,000 for Emlyn Hughes having watched one of his first games for the Seasiders]</b> He absolutely adored playing football. He would just give 110 per cent. They called him ‘Crazy Horse’ and that’s exactly what he was. He never stopped, he was up and down the pitch, cajoling everyone. He’ll not be forgotten.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s ability to let Liverpool forget about Philippe Coutinho]</b> Salah has made people ­forget about Philippe Coutinho and I honestly couldn’t see that ever happening. Coutinho was a great player and usually, when he played well, Liverpool would win. When he went, I thought he was going to be a massive loss. He creates just as many chances and I’m not having a go at Coutinho, because he is a fantastic player, but I have to say that Salah is unbelievable. I’ve never known someone in their first season at Anfield except for Kenny Dalglish to have made such an impact. We knew what Kenny had done for Celtic and Scotland, but it wasn’t until we saw him in training that we realised he was absolutely ­brilliant. He was beyond belief. We wondered: ‘What have we got here?’<br /><br />We didn’t think anyone could replace Kevin Keegan, who had left for ­Hamburg in the summer and had been ­worshipped by the Kop. It was a similar ­situation with Coutinho, but what Salah has done has made certain that the team hasn’t ­suffered. What a foursome that would have been. Keegan, ­Dalglish, Coutinho and Salah. I don’t think Liverpool would lose too many games!</p>

  <p><b>[Anfield legend Terry McDermott says Liverpool won’t choke in their bid to end their 29-year title drought]</b> It does get to you a little bit but it doesn’t bother good players, whether you’re playing a little five-a-side game or a big match against Man United or Everton. They just play. Sometimes the fans can get a little bit like that. Don’t forget it was only three or four years ago that they should have won the league. They have been so close before. If someone had said ‘in the beginning of February you’re going to be three points clear of Manchester City’… you’d have snapped their hand off without a shadow of a doubt. I know we’re all disappointed because one minute we’re looking at seven points in front and then all of a sudden it’s gone down, but City might lose.<br /><br />Keep doing what you’ve been doing; they’re top of the league so they must have been doing something right. They’re not playing as well as they have been. I thought they played a lot better football last year, they were fantastic, and they’ve been very good at times this year. Sometimes like the Crystal Palace game, a fantastic game, 4-3, Leicester on the weekend, that was disappointing, but that’s what happens. Man City have had their little blip and it’s only a little blip at Liverpool. There’s still a long way to go and if they start playing the way they have been then they’ll take some catching</p>
