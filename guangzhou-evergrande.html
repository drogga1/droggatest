  <p><b>[Guangzhou Evergrande have publicly denied interest in stars such as Gareth Bale and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]</b> With the deepening reform of Chinese football in recent years, the domestic leagues are making tremendous progress and enjoying packed stadiums. Starting from 2017, we stick to the principle that the club would only buy foreign players whose stature is compatible with the current level of the Chinese football. We resolutely oppose the purchase of foreign players at a prohibitive price and the engagement in an arms race. Instead, the development of homegrown players will figure high on our list of priorities. We will be firmly committed to our ‘one-stop shop’ project for Evergrande Football School that would witness player after player coming off the conveyor belt to play first team football. We will gradually reach the target of fielding a Chinese-only squad by 2020 so as to make a contribution to the steady, healthy and sustainable development of Chinese football.</p>
