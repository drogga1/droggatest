<blockquote>
  <p><b>[New England Revolution hope two-striker look of 2016 can form foundation for 2017 success]</b> We’d had some lucky moments in years before that got us through and kind of pushed us forward. Those lucky moments you need to get through didn’t happen for us last year and, in some cases, went the other way for us.<br /><br />We’ve got a lot of guys who can play in any position, midfield, up front. That flow of the game, whether that’d be running in from the No. 10, going out wide or going up top and then the forward dropping into the No. 10 spot, those little changes are going to create holes and gaps in the defense. That’s what’s going to move us forward and, in the end, we’re going to have four at the back. And no matter the formation in front of them, they have a job to do and they know that<br /><br />The fluidity is where we have to be at our best. I think when you’re playing a 4-3-3 or a diamond, the interchange is key. Sometimes you can get stagnant in a 4-3-3 if you’re playing with just one lone No. 9, the midfielders aren’t close enough and the wing forwards are isolated. I think the diamond formation brought everyone tighter together, a little closer and the interchange became fluid again. That’s really important for us in every formation. When we had our success in ‘14 and ‘15 and even ‘13, it came from the fluidity of movement of our attacking group</p>
