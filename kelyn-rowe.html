  <p><b>[New England Revolution hope two-striker look of 2016 can form foundation for 2017 success]</b> We’d had some lucky moments in years before that got us through and kind of pushed us forward. Those lucky moments you need to get through didn’t happen for us last year and, in some cases, went the other way for us.<br /><br />We’ve got a lot of guys who can play in any position, midfield, up front. That flow of the game, whether that’d be running in from the No. 10, going out wide or going up top and then the forward dropping into the No. 10 spot, those little changes are going to create holes and gaps in the defense. That’s what’s going to move us forward and, in the end, we’re going to have four at the back. And no matter the formation in front of them, they have a job to do and they know that<br /><br />The fluidity is where we have to be at our best. I think when you’re playing a 4-3-3 or a diamond, the interchange is key. Sometimes you can get stagnant in a 4-3-3 if you’re playing with just one lone No. 9, the midfielders aren’t close enough and the wing forwards are isolated. I think the diamond formation brought everyone tighter together, a little closer and the interchange became fluid again. That’s really important for us in every formation. When we had our success in ‘14 and ‘15 and even ‘13, it came from the fluidity of movement of our attacking group</p>

  <p><b>[Mr. Dependable Kelyn Rowe earns USA chance with consistency and versatility]</b> If I could play anywhere it would be somewhere in the middle of the park. I enjoy making tackles and finding things off the forwards when they win a turnover of some sort, so I actually enjoying being a box-to-box midfielder, no matter how much running it actually is.<br /><br />I’ve watched a lot video of myself. Chris Tierney and I’ll go even further and watch guys like Marcelo and Dani Alves. I try to learn the positional things - when do they go forward when do they not go forward - and defensively, where their positioning is. Just because you need to get to know each position as much as you can. In a pinch, I could be there, I might as well be prepared for it rather than scrambling<br /><br />It’s a very big honor but I need to make the 23, then the 18, then the 11. I’ve still got a lot of work to do. They liked the way I played up to this <b>[point]</b> and if I keep playing that <b>[way]</b> it’s going to be a positive. For me it’s about doing the same thing I have, if not better. It pushes me forward every day to keep working<br /><br />I think I’ve gotten a little better at being more consistent, both defensively and offensively - creating chances as well as getting stuck in - and making sure I’m positionally sound. I’ve improved some parts of my game defensively. I’m just waiting for that offensive burst to come through</p>

  <p><b>[On himself]</b> You can see it in the runs he makes. He’s moving around everywhere, he finds that back line. The chances he has are incredible. He always finds himself at the right place at the right time</p>

  <p><b>[USA’s win against Ghana]</b> Footballers got to be footballers. Especially in that attack, you find runners. I think the first 10 minutes, we kind of just ran around trying to find what each other were doing, making the right runs. After that, we started to settle down and started to find tendencies. You see it in the second half especially. I thought we had some good possessions and some good attacks</p>
