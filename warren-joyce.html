  <p><b>[Former Manchester United youth coach Warren Joyce has revealed what Paul Pogba was like as a youngster during his first spell at the club]</b> He was an ordinary kid; in love with football and I’m sure he was in love with Manchester United. He wanted to work and improve and was desperate to be a footballer. I saw him on his first day back and he was the same kid who left, very much part of the group, laughing about the old times and the things we used to say. Maybe there were times when I gave him some stick, they all have stupid things they want to do with their hair but it doesn’t change what’s in his heart or his make-up. As a footballer he can do everything: run, dribble, score, tackle, head, shoot pass long or short. He could do all that and wanted to get better<br /><br />Aged 11 you thought he was going to be a player just by the way he glided across the ground. A lot of work went into him in the academy. There were lads in the reserves who probably weren’t as good as him but we wanted him to get that feeling of scoring goals and practising his runs<br /><br /><b>[On Jesse Lingard]</b> He’s had to keep grinding and working away. I’ve spent hours on the motorway up and down the country watching him when he was out on loan and making him believe. Everybody thought he was a good player but Jesse was always behind everybody because he was smaller and weaker than the others. His attitude was fantastic. He kept working and I’m glad to see he is getting his rewards</p>

  <p><b>[Decisive Bruce Kamau edging closer to European dream and has Warren Joyce to thank]</b> I thought that even before I came to the country, watching him play for Adelaide - I thought he was an outstanding player, to be fair. Looking at players who you think could play in English football, he’s certainly one that could play in the English championship, easily.</p>

  <p><b>[New City manager Warren Joyce has chosen to play with Scottish attacker Ross McCormick in a lone striking role this season, with Cahill reduced to only one start from six appearances]</b> Having players of Tim’s stature in the dressing room can only help develop a squad’s ambitions, and his impact on the team and for the club is well known, particularly with the younger players in the squad. In the period that I’ve worked with Tim, I have appreciated the contribution he has made both on and off the field and the dedication he has shown in training. We all wish him the very best on the next stage of his career.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City confirm the signing of Dario Vidosic]</b> Dario is a player who will bring a wealth of experience at this level to our front third. He has represented the Socceroos over 20 times and played at a high level overseas and we are excited to have him join our squad here in Melbourne.</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Arzani looking to leave Melbourne City for rival A-League clubs]</b> There is a lot of things he has got to work on in his game. He’s got to be willing to listen to people at the football club. If he trusts us to develop him, he could be a very good player. If he listens to other people and has got a different agenda, I’m seen a lot of players exactly the same as him fall by the wayside.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Warren Joyce declared Tottenham striker Shayon Harrison has the potential to follow in the footsteps of former loanees Harry Kane and Jesse Lingard]</b> I have worked with young players a lot. You can put high demands on them but a big bit for him is you don’t know how much he can achieve. I think it’s limitless. When you are a kid, very quickly you can turn things around, and if you have got that amount of talent he’s got. Harry Kane, Jesse Lingard had loan spells where they were both doing all right, doing not so great, you speak to people at different clubs and they were not doing that well there. But then all the things add up and somewhere down the line things click into place with the good habits they have been taught and being at the right place at the right time, and they can go through the roof. The experiences that you can get that are hard but they help develop you for the future and the next one <b>[move]</b> might be the one in which you are flying. We are looking to help him develop his career and for him to help us along the way. He has got talent, it’s making the most of the talent he has got.<br /><br />He is playing against men, he is playing against Aussies who probably will want to kick him, so he’s got to stand up for himself and show he can deal with everything that’s thrown at him. The challenge is on him to create and score goals as well</p>
