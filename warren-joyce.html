<blockquote>
  <p>[Melbourne City coach Warren Joyce declared Tottenham striker Shayon Harrison has the potential to follow in the footsteps of former loanees Harry Kane and Jesse Lingard] I have worked with young players a lot. You can put high demands on them but a big bit for him is you don’t know how much he can achieve. I think it’s limitless. When you are a kid, very quickly you can turn things around, and if you have got that amount of talent he’s got. Harry Kane, Jesse Lingard had loan spells where they were both doing all right, doing not so great, you speak to people at different clubs and they were not doing that well there. But then all the things add up and somewhere down the line things click into place with the good habits they have been taught and being at the right place at the right time, and they can go through the roof. The experiences that you can get that are hard but they help develop you for the future and the next one [move] might be the one in which you are flying. We are looking to help him develop his career and for him to help us along the way. He has got talent, it’s making the most of the talent he has got.<br /><br />He is playing against men, he is playing against Aussies who probably will want to kick him, so he’s got to stand up for himself and show he can deal with everything that’s thrown at him. The challenge is on him to create and score goals as well</p>
