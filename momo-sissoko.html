  <p><b>[Momo Sissoko says <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> wants <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, but he favours <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> return]</b> I know that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> wants him at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but he would like to return to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. But these are situations that depend not only on <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> but also on Manchester United; he has a contract until 2021 with the English club. In my opinion, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> must find a team that makes him feel important in order to regain his top level<br /><br /><b>[Regular starts were hard for Sissoko to come by on occasions during his time in Italy]</b> From the first day that I set foot at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I immediately felt at home. It was an honour for me to play for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I don’t have a special memory, for me every moment spent in the black and white shirt was special</p>

  <p><b>[Momo Sissoko calls for action against African racism row doctors. Camille Locht of Inserm and Jean-Paul Mira in Paris were debating potential solutions to the Covid-19 crisis. when the latter questioned whether studies should be undertaken in Africa rather than Europe]</b> What the two doctors said is really a scandal. At this point, we must really be aware that this is not a joke. When you make such statements against African people, or against any people, you must be measured and be aware of what you’re saying<br /><br />Africa hasn’t been touched <b>[by Covid-19]</b> compared to Europe, but clearly <b>[the doctors]</b> said ‘as there’s poverty and other things over there, there are things we can experiment’. But it shouldn’t happen like that<br /><br />Close friends who I’ve spoken to about this are really wound up by what they said, and these kinds of comments are unacceptable, particularly in a country like France<br /><br />Eto’o is a very respectful person, but the moment he heard <b>[what was said]</b>, he took his gloves off. The statements he made come from his annoyance, but it’s normal to be shocked by these kinds of comments. I’m comfortably more shocked by what the professors said than what Eto’o said</p>
