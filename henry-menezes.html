  <p><b>[Henry Menezes says ‘Khalid Jamil had perfect pulse of Aizawl FC’s I-League winners, a well blended team’]</b> We had kept him as the captain of the team <b>[Mumbai FC]</b> as our objective was to keep him with the team and to help him grow with the team as a coach. That was due to his ability and attitude he possessed to lead the team. He was one of the most brilliant creative players in the midfield with a good vision to score and create goals.<br /><br />That had taken him forward but a few injuries hampered his career. He has had ups and downs as a player also. In a couple of years he took up the U-19 team which was when he was forecasted as the next coach <b>[of the senior team]</b><br /><br />Whenever you have some failures or rejections, you always grow. I’m sure Khalid is a changed person now. After he left Mumbai FC, I requested him to be in the game and offered him the Maharashtrian state team, but his offer from Aizawl came in and he took permission to leave. From there started the story. It was an important turn in his life. Everybody goes through it and he has come out very strong<br /><br />The team always needs a blend of experienced players, youngsters, couple of good foreigners and a good coach. So the combination was perfect and I feel that he had the right pulse of the team. Adding to that, Mizoram football has grown in stature because of the strong local league they conduct from which players are acustomed to play a very high quality game. The government support which they have is also immense.<br /><br />It’s very important to bring in that kind of a culture because once you have the backing of the crowd and you start winning, people start identifying themselves with the team and there is more power in the team that grows. I think Aizawl are a fantastic example of how when a team starts winning people identify themselves with a team</p>
