  <p><b>[q: You have been in Malaysia and Selangor for a few weeks now. How are you settling down so far?]</b> All is fine so far. I find that there’s not much of a difference here in Malaysia compared to my home back in Indonesia. So that makes it a lot easier for me to adapt and get used to the situation and environment in Malaysia</p>

  <p><b>[q: How about your new teammates? Have they been welcoming?]</b> Everyone here has been treating me well and made me feel very comfortable. As for now I don’t have any problems with them. A lot of them are also new players in Selangor so we are adapting together</p>

  <p><b>[q: You have played against your new teammates Hazwan Bakri and Thamil Arasu in the SEA Games recently. Now you are training and playing with them. What are your thoughts on these two?]</b> In my opinion Hazwan and Thamil are two good young players, who are of course good additions to the team. I’m happy to be playing with them and I also hope I’ll get chances to play in the games</p>

  <p><b>[q: Before you decided to sign for Selangor, did you get a chance to meet <a href="bambang-pamungkas.html">Bambang Pamungkas</a> or Elie Aiboy who used to play for Selangor?]</b> Unfortunately I didn’t get a chance to meet any of them prior to signing for Selangor. We live in different cities in Indonesia. So I only watched their games on YouTube to get myself excited and inspired</p>

  <p><b>[q: Bambang and Elie have won trophies with Selangor. Do you feel any pressure to do the same or better than them?]</b> I believe it will be a tough job for me as the fans expectation on me will be high. But then again, I don’t think of myself as a star or a fantastic player. I’m not here not for fun but to work hard and give my very best for Selangor. And hopefully in the end I’ll be able to win something for the team</p>

  <p><b>[q: Looking at the Selangor team, what do you think is the biggest quality that they have?]</b> From what I see, everyone is together and wants to work hard fighting for places in the team. I think that’s a good first step before we begin the season</p>

  <p><b>[Andik Vermansah says Indonesia will dethrone Thailand in three years’ time]</b> Looking at the quality of the U16, U19 and U22 players, I think in three years’ time we can dethrone Thailand. In the recent SEA Games, we were simply unlucky. Although the tournament was won by Thailand. I think in terms of performance Indonesia were the best side. From the goalkeepers, defenders, to the attackers they all have good individual skills in terms of ball control. They are also able to play in a composed manner, with the back line not simply lobbing the ball forward</p>

  <p><b>[Andik Vermansah remarked that whichever club he plays for, the club need to have a winning mentality and the drive to win silverware]</b> I want to play for a team that is serious about winning championships because I came to Malaysia to win, not just for the paycheck. I’m playing away from my country, so it’s only right that I get to do my best. I’m playing away from my country, so it’s only right that I get to do my best. I don’t want to sound like I’m begging for an extension, but it’d be better for all parties to tell me from early on whether they want me or not for 2018. Let’s not leave it at the last minute when the foreign player transfer window is already closed. I hope they can be professional about it. Honestly, it’d be a shame if I left as I’ve been with them for four years. I have many fond memories with Selangor over the years and my friends are here, I can’t really imagine playing for another club</p>

  <p><b>[Indonesia’s Andik Vermansah ready for Singapore test]</b> To be honest I have confidence, our team has very talented young players. We are not afraid even if we play anywhere. Especially lately we often win against Singapore, it becomes a belief. If that is true, I am very grateful. Hopefully TKI <b>[Indonesian Workers]</b> in Malaysia can go there again. It can add to our passion to compete</p>
