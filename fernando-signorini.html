  <p><b>[The other side of Man City record-breaker Sergio Aguero]</b> Many players concern themselves with being recognised as one of the world’s best, and he doesn’t. And that’s fantastic to me because despite that he still keeps looking for new things, coming up with new things, he keeps challenging himself to be better every day, not necessarily to be the best, but to be the best that he can be. That’s the primary objective that anybody in any discipline should have.</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Luis Menotti’s ideas are expanded upon by his long-term assistant, Fernando Signorini]</b> Today the pressure is the same, here the people demand of everybody else what they don’t demand of themselves. For that reason there has been a perverse atmosphere in Argentina in recent years, above all with football, which has stopped being an excellent tool for alleviating the pressure of the really important things in life, to a belief that a game of football will decide the future of an entire nation. This is extremely foolish. Football has to remain a wonderful reason to be happy, and an important weapon to help parents and teachers form the best individual possible. In a society that needs to change, if football does not serve to educate, and with its cultural elements if it does not serve to transform individuals and in turn society itself, then football serves for very little, or at least solely for the interests of big business.<br /><br />In Argentina we are in this prehistoric era, where football is more important than culture, than art, than society. Today, more than ever, football in Argentina serves to numb the mind, to form brutal desires, and form opinions<br /><br />The national team, at the moment, is surrounded by an exaggerated level of coverage, driven fundamentally by the media, that fills the screens, radios and the written press. From the outside, it puts an unbearable pressure on the team</p>

  <p><b>[How Maradona helped Messi become the world’s best free-kick taker]</b> I saw Diego coming, he took him by the shoulder and said: ‘Little Leo, little Leo, come here, man. Let’s try it again.’ It was like a teacher with his pupil. He continued: ‘Put the ball here and listen to me: don’t take your foot away from the ball so fast because otherwise it won’t know what you want.’ He then stroked the ball with his left foot straight into the angle of the net, with Messi’s face full of admiration.<br /><br />Everyone had to have two or three tries except Messi. He was the only one to do it first time, in 30 seconds he had finished, even the camera operators were impressed</p>
