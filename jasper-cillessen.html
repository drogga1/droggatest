  <p><b>[Jasper Cillessen has made no secret of his desire to move away from Barcelona, but fears a €60 million valuation is pricing him out of the market]</b> The fact that Barcelona ask for €60m for me does not help anything. I still have to wait and see what happens in one of the top five European leagues. <b>[A decision]</b> will only be taken after the holidays</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands team-mate Jasper Cillessen says Matthijs de Ligt has the quality to play for Barcelona and should consider joining the club]</b> I sat down with him to talk about all his options, the same as I did with Frenkie <b>[de Jong]</b>. I told him that the decision belongs to him. Matthijs is a good boy and he knows what he has to do. I told him that I could not make the decision for him - he knows what he has to do. I can only talk about good things about Barca because it’s a great club and I have a great feeling with Barca.<br /><br /><b>[Should De Ligt make the move to Camp Nou he will have to compete with Gerard Pique, Clement Lenglet and Samuel Umtiti for a starting spot]</b> He has many qualities. He is very young, he is only 19 years old. Barcelona needs players with a very high level and he has the level to play there<br /><br /><b>[Asked for an update on his situation, amid rumoured interest from fellow La Liga side Valencia]</b> At the moment I do not know what is going to happen. After the Nations League I will go on vacation with my friends and we will see what happens. Valencia are a great team, but I do not know what will happen because I have not talked to my agent yet. I only know what I read in the newspapers and on the internet. I will do it after the final and enjoy my vacation</p>

  <p><b>[Jasper Cillessen has hit back at the criticism which he has been subjected to following the Netherlands’ defeat to Portugal in the Nations League final]</b> I saw the ball very late, because Denzel Dumfries and Daley Blind were standing there. And Goncalo Guedes’s shot was pretty hard.<br /><br /><b>[A large part of the blame for the defeat has been put at the door of Cillessen]</b> In the Netherlands, we go very easy on that. I already received some messages: the Dutch media write a lot about it and I’m a little tired of that. I saw the ball late and he hit it pretty hard. That’s the only thing I’ve seen right now. Anyway, we always criticise someone very easily in the Netherlands<br /><br /><b>[Many Dutch fans took to social media to lament Cillessen’s penalty saving record]</b> I will be careful what I say: I’m a little tired of that as well. It’s too easy to say that, especially if you check out Rashford’s last few penalties. It’s too easy what everyone has said about it. I really don’t like it.<br /><br /><b>[the Netherlands international is happy to bide his time and wait until returning from his holiday to make any decision on his future]</b> I still have not considered anything. I want to go on holiday, then I’ll meet with my agent and we’ll talk.</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen speaks upon his arrival at the club]</b> When my agent told me <b>[about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s interest]</b> I asked him if it was a joke. <b>[I couldn’t believe that]</b> the best club in the world was interested in me. I want to win titles at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I would like to be the goalkeeper that wins the Champions League as a starter</p>

  <p><b>[Jasper Cillessen says his €60 million price tag ‘doesn’t make it easy’ for him to leave Barcelona]</b> My release clause doesn’t make it easy for me to transfer. It’s clear that Barca won’t let me leave for an apple and an egg.<br /><br /><b>[Cillessen feels inflation may be the main reason for him having to stay put]</b> The market is really crazy. Honestly. It’s true they are paying incredible transfer fees for players that we all know aren’t worth that much. But you need to accept that it’s the market which determines the prices and each player’s situation depends on the market at the time<br /><br /><b>[The Dutch ace also revealed that he will accept whatever decision his current employers make]</b> The club knows I’ve never been one to kick up a fuss</p>

  <p><b>[Jasper Cillessen had grown tired of sitting on the bench at Barcelona and does not view his move to Valencia as a backward step]</b> I have not had problems with Barcelona or with any team. For me, the most important thing is to play. It’s the only reason I’m here. For me to come to Valencia is not a step back. Between being on the bench of Barcelona or playing at Valencia, playing at Valencia is much better. It is easy. It is not a step back. When I arrived at Barcelona, Ter Stegen was on a different level than now. And after three years he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. I think we both improved, but it was time for me to leave<br /><br /><b>[The Dutchman said of <a href="rafinha.html">Rafinha</a>]</b> He is a very good player, he has had very bad luck with injuries. But he is a great player, it would be very important here with this system and for the coach. He is my friend and I want him to come here</p>
