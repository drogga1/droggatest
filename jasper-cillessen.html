  <p><b>[New <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen speaks upon his arrival at the club]</b> When my agent told me <b>[about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s interest]</b> I asked him if it was a joke. <b>[I couldn’t believe that]</b> the best club in the world was interested in me. I want to win titles at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I would like to be the goalkeeper that wins the Champions League as a starter</p>

  <p><b>[Jasper Cillessen had grown tired of sitting on the bench at Barcelona and does not view his move to Valencia as a backward step]</b> I have not had problems with Barcelona or with any team. For me, the most important thing is to play. It’s the only reason I’m here. For me to come to Valencia is not a step back. Between being on the bench of Barcelona or playing at Valencia, playing at Valencia is much better. It is easy. It is not a step back. When I arrived at Barcelona, Ter Stegen was on a different level than now. And after three years he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. I think we both improved, but it was time for me to leave<br /><br /><b>[The Dutchman said of Rafinha]</b> He is a very good player, he has had very bad luck with injuries. But he is a great player, it would be very important here with this system and for the coach. He is my friend and I want him to come here</p>
