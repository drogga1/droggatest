  <p><b>[Ex-Barcelona star Bolo Zenden reveals how he dislocated <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>’s shoulder during judo bout]</b> My father was talented in the sport – a knee injury forced him to retire early, but he teamed up with the Dutch world and Olympic champion Anton Geesink to promote a judo programme around the world. He was a judo commentator for Dutch TV too, and opened a sports school at home.

The bed had wheels, though, which made him slip and he dislocated a shoulder. He was out for a few weeks</p>
