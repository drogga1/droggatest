<blockquote>
  <p>Taking over the national captaincy from <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> in 2002, he was never supposed to outshine his illustrious predecessor, a man who had become the embodiment of defensive greatness.<br /><br />As a Neapolitan – considered a southern outsider by many in the industrial and footballing heartlands to the north – <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> was an unlikely hero to unite the country.<br /><br />But the foundations had been laid in the streets of in Fuorigrotta, a working-class neighborhood on the western edge of Naples, where the young <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> learned he’d need to play smart and hard – developing his positioning, athleticism and an impressive leap – to overcome bigger opponents. He was the quintessential Scugnizzo: a smiling, cunning street urchin, spending his days playing football in the road<br /><br />Sporting his then-trademark boyish buzz-cut and ear-to-ear smile, <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> rarely looked like a man with the fate of an ever-expectant nation on his shoulders.<br /><br />His cool demeanor is typical Neapolitan (when reporters asked what the secret to his robust performances was, he replied: ‘Eating well, getting plenty of sleep and having sex’) and set him apart from his volatile France counterpart <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> – who would depart the field in extra time after lashing out with an infamous headbutt.<br /><br />And when captain <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> was calm, his teammates were too: the job was ‘very easy,’ he says, because of the intelligence and professionalism of those around him. At times – including the bulk of the final – they didn’t make it look easy, as they toiled through regular game time, but professionalism was the word in the tiebreaker<br /><br />It took a four-hour coach journey back to Rome’s Circus Maximus stadium – ‘a place where the old gladiators celebrate’ – for the realization to sink in that everything would now change. The sight of over 150,000 ecstatic Italians in the arena – and many more partying outside – left no doubt.<br /><br />Five days after the celebrations, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>’s club at the time, was booted from the Italian top division for its role in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>’s Calciopoli match fixing scandal, and he was soon on his way out<br /><br />It would be the beginning of a turbulent period for him, culminating in another World Cup – <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>’s fourth – this one, not so pleasant. Aged 32, his record in club football to that point consisted of hailed performances but little to show for it. The two Scudetti he had won in the two previous seasons with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> had been stripped, and the only silverware that remained were <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup and Coppa Italia wins with <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>, coming between barren periods at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and Inter Milan<br /><br />With Real, he won back-to-back <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> titles in his first two years, taking over the No. 5 shirt formerly worn by <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> started to pick up individual awards too. He became only the third defender to win the Ballon d’Or – then Europe’s top individual prize, usually taken by creative playmakers or lime-light stealing strikers – by beating the likes of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> and <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>. He says the new recognition of his talents was overwhelming<br /><br />But things would not stay so golden. An unhappy return to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> followed a third season at Real, where fans in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> refused forgive the earlier exit of a player they had adopted as one of their own. A failed drug test in 2009 – for which he was later cleared of any wrongdoing – added to the tension and after two seasons with no titles, he was on his way out<br /><br />Still national captain, he surpassed <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> to become Italy’s most capped player by August 2009, with 127 caps (a record since surpassed by his longtime friend and World Cup teammate Gianluigi Buffon). But – aged 35 – he was beginning to slow and knee injuries became common<br /><br />Having sat on the sidelines with an ankle injury as Italy lost in the quarterfinals at Euro 2008, he reappeared for the a disastrous 2010 World Cup, where the defending champions took an early flight home, having failed to win a match, in a group that comprised minor footballing nations Paraguay, Slovakia and New Zealand. He retired from international football on his return<br /><br />Sitting in the Al-Rashad Stadium among Dubai’s glass skyscrapers and petro-dollar yachts, <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> now boasts a jet of black hair which could render him unrecognizable from the skinhead defender lifting the trophy in 2006 – if it weren’t for the unmistakable wide smile. The lavish surroundings hadn’t been his first choice<br /><br />Before joining UAE Football League side Al-Ahli, where he is now assistant coach, he’d attempted to engineer a move back to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, where he made his debut almost two decades earlier, and where he could be reunited with his younger brother Paolo, also a defender. It was where he’d been happiest – graduating from a ball boy to first-team regular at his childhood club<br /><br />Despite not reaching the same heights as his brother on the world stage, Paolo succeeded in one area where Fabio failed: making a successful return to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, who he led to a Coppa Italia victory in 2012<br /><br />A famous story recalls young <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> training as a youngster opposite <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s greatest hero, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a>, and delivering a crunching tackle. The coaches were apparently less than impressed, but the Argentine legend urged him to keep the passion. Even above his home nation’s defending luminaries – <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>, <a href="franco-baresi.html">Franco Baresi</a> and the rest – <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> ranks <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, who led Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before joining <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, as a career-long inspiration.<br /><br />When the homecoming wish fell flat, it was time to ‘try something different,’ moving to Al Ahli first as a player on a free transfer after the 2010 World Cup, then joining the coaching staff the following year after knee injuries forced his retirement<br /><br />For a player whose career was defined by discipline, hard work and tactic nous, the move into coaching was unsurprisingly straightforward, and his appointment has coincided with an upturn in the Dubai outfit’s fortunes. He has also learned to speak English<br /><br />His contract with Al Ahli ends in June and the future is, as yet, undecided – although he has recently stated his ambition to return to Italy once he has earned his <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> coaching badges</p>
