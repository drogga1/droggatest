Sheffield United have broken their transfer record for the third time in a month to sign striker Lys Mousset from Bournemouth.</p>

<h4 id="2020-03-10-retrieve">2020 03 10 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sheffield United striker Lys Mousset has revealed that family issues were the reason behind his drop-off in form at the end of last year]</b> I have to be more consistent in my performances. But without looking for excuses, I also had facts in my personal life that affected me. If I was less decisive at one point, it was because I was not well in my head. It’s not easy to talk about it, but basically I had two big family problems in the space of two weeks. It happened in December, around the end of year celebrations. I was not at all in it, I was elsewhere. It’s better now. I give myself completely to training to resume my rhythm<br /><br />Of course we think about <b>[earning European football]</b>. It’s normal. We will fight until the end to try to grab a European place. Our position may surprise because we are promoted, but the squad works well. The coach <b>[Chris Wilder]</b> always puts us back on track. It is no coincidence and we will continue to work to get there. <b>[We must]</b> simply play our football. It will be necessary to build intensity as our opponents do and if we succeed, it should <b>[be enough]</b></p>
