  <p><b>[<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> have confirmed an initial launch of their new 2019-20 strip that prominently featured betting brand Paddy Power was a marketing stunt]</b> We’re happy to support Paddy Power’s ‘Save Our Shirt’ campaign with the launch of our actual 2019-20 home kit this morning. It has been a very interesting two days since the original launch on Wednesday, which we expected, but we’ve always had in mind that our supporters would understand, and really like the real kit when it was properly revealed today. We’re really happy with this kit, which is unique in modern-day football. I’d like to thank Paddy Power, Umbro and everyone else involved in the kit for their hard work towards today</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> charged with misconduct following Paddy Power fake kit stunt]</b> I have to thank a number of people, including Paddy Power to help make it possible. We’re looking forward to getting the kit on sale.<br /><br />When I first saw it, it was a bit weird because you’re used to seeing sponsors on kits. But our fan-base love it, and for me that’s what it’s all about. We take pride in the kit and the blue and white stripes that we wear - it looks fantastic.<br /><br />Now we’ve got a kit everyone’s proud of people are talking about <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a>. Maybe initially for the wrong reasons but now for the right reasons.<br /><br />We’ve certainly caused a stir with it, I think people are looking at it and taking note. We love the ‘Save our Shirts’ campaign and we’re looking forward to the next 12 months.</p>
