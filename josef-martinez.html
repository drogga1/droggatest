  <p><b>[Atlanta United signs Venezuela forward Josef Martinez as designated player]</b> I’m very happy to be here, this is a great project. I was able to see the training ground and the stadium that the club is building, and I knew that coming to Atlanta was the best decision. Also, there is a great coaching staff and remarkable young players. I can’t wait to start to work with my new teammates.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Josef Martinez? The Venezuelan striker who broke the MLS scoring record]</b> My grandfather played <b>[soccer]</b> and my father as well, so that was the sport in our house. My father was a goalkeeper and when I started to play I wanted to be a goalkeeper, but that didn’t last too long.<br /><br /><b>[On Ronaldo]</b> I was a Real Madrid fan and I loved watching him play. I liked that he was a killer. Not just for the joy he brought to the game and the skills he had, but the fact that he was a killer. If you gave him any room he would punish you. If he got a chance he finished it<br /><br />The first time they called me I had my doubts because I was in Europe and didn’t know much about MLS. Once I got here I knew it was a good move for me and Atlanta felt like a good place for me<br /><br />I don’t regret anything. What happened in Italy happened. I learned a lot and I thank the people who helped me get there. People can say what they want about my time in Italy. All leagues are different, all teams are different. The Italian league is very defensive. You don’t see games finish 5-5, or 5-0. You see a lot of games ending 1-0, or 0-0, and it’s nothing against that style, but I think it’s too tactical. They’re different leagues, different styles, and different approaches, but I love it here<br /><br />I don’t like talking about the record because I don’t want to think about what I’ve done. I want to think about the future and about winning with Atlanta. That’s what matters to me, that and spending time with my niece and my two dogs<br /><br />I have a lot to give to this team and this city. Coming to Atlanta was the best thing to happen for. I don’t think I could have made it as a goalkeeper, I’m too small. I think it worked out well. I prefer to shoot at the goal more than protect it</p>

  <p><b>[Major League Soccer Most Valuable Player Josef Martinez says he’ll be staying with Atlanta United for as long as the club will have him]</b> I’ve said it before that I am going to be here as long as they want me. I just want to say thank you to all the people at the club - the president, all the directors, everyone who works at the club from the security staff to the cooks in the kitchen, to even <b>[club PR rep Justin Veldhuis]</b>, who I yell at when he asks me to do an interview, and everyone else at the club.<br /><br />In my speech, I couldn’t find enough words to thank the fans for the support they’ve given not only me, and also my family and people close to me in these two years on the field and also off the field, seeing people in the street. The support has been incredible. All these triumphs that we’re having as a team, a lot of it is in great part due to the amazing support of our fans</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron’s Atlanta legacy is secure even if MLS Cup was his final match]</b> Before the game, I had a moment with Miguel. and I just thanked him for all the help that he’s given me over the last two seasons. I told him, ‘Please make me a champion today because I’ve never been a champion before’. I want to thank him for that.</p>

  <p><b>[Record-breaker. MVP. Golden Boot winner. Josef Martinez sure earned a lot of accolades in 2018]</b> I’m most happy with the cup. Everyone on this team contributed something and had sacrifices. This is a win that we want to celebrate because it’s been a long year.<br /><br />It’s great because I was feeling a lot of pressure before this game. My neighbors were putting flags all around my house and pushing notes under my door. I had a lot of pressure to deal with, but I wanted to thank everyone. The fans. They deserve it. It’s a great feeling to win this here</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United has signed forward Josef Martinez to a five-year contract extension that will last through the 2023 season]</b> This means a lot to me because of the affection that the fans have shown me, that the fans show all of the players. It’s unique. They recognize the effort that you give and they know you did everything to win, and I think that’s why we love playing here. I have to thank everyone. My teammates, the city, my family and friends, because this is a dream I’ve always had. I’ve said before that I don’t want to go anywhere because this is my home. You can expect more work, more intensity, because that’s who I am. I want to win. I want to do everything for my teammates and for the city.</p>

  <p><b>[Josef Martinez announced on Wednesday that he has undergone successful surgery after tearing his ACL]</b> In the midst of the humanitarian crisis we are all living through, in which more than ever we need to think about and take care of each other, just wanted to share that I’m blessed that my knee surgery today went well. I want to personally thank UPMC in Pittsburgh, doctors Freddie Fu and Volker Musahl, Atlanta United, my teammates and most of all the city of Atlanta for the unconditional support. Also, everyone in Venezuela and around the world for the good wishes and support. God bless and protect us all in these challenging times</p>
