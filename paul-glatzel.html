  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are facing an anxious wait over the fitness of young striker Paul Glatzel]</b> It was tough. But mentally it has helped a lot to know you can overcome those things. I seem to have come through it quite well, and I think it has shaped me into the player I am</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Glatzel believes his new <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> contract is a massive show of faith from the club as he recovers from his long-term knee injury]</b> I was disappointed to get my injury at the start of the season, but it’s a great feeling and it shows that the club has got faith in me. Now I can just focus on my rehab and get back on the pitch. The contract makes it easier. It’s massive. Mentally, it’s good to be able to focus on the rehab and know that there’s people that have faith in me and they know I’ll come back from my injury stronger and I’ll be ready when I’m back on the pitch<br /><br />Knowing that I’ve done it before helps a lot because I know I’ve got the mindset for it and I know I can do it. It’s just the long process and I’ve got to believe in myself and trust the physios as well. I know I can do it, so it will help me. I was looking forward to pre-season, I’d done quite a bit in the summer to be ready for pre-season because I thought I might get an opportunity. Obviously half an hour in or whatever, and it’s all come tumbling down and the season is gone for me. But with this contract now hopefully I’ve got the <b>[future]</b> to make an impact<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on the aftermath of the injury]</b> It was quite a tough time, to be honest. I was quite low, probably the lowest I’ve been. Even though I’ve had quite a few injuries, that was probably the toughest to take just because I was on such a high and I was doing quite well. The days after weren’t a great place but everyone got around me and I’m in a good place now just getting ready for the rehab and getting back</p>
