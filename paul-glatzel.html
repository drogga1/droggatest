  <p><b>[The German Scouser hoping to fire Liverpool to FA Youth Cup glory]</b> Everyone is buzzing. It’s a big tournament, one you look at and want to be part of. If we were to win it, it would be unbelievable<br /><br />It’s just me and my parents in England. Everybody else is in Germany so I go back quite a lot to see family. Germany is quite a big part of our family, and I will have a few people over to watch on Thursday. They’re looking forward to it.<br /><br />I’ll just focus on club football and see where that takes me first. And if I have a decision to make in the future I’ll have to make it then. It’s been everything to me, really. In pre-season I was thinking to myself that I just need to keep fit and play as many games as I can. That was my aim. To then play games, captain the team and score goals and assist goals and help the team as much as I have, it’s a great feeling. But it is all about the team<br /><br />It was tough. I had a hamstring injury at under-16s which went from January to the end of the season. Then I was on my way back and then broke my leg, which then put me out for the start of the next season, my first year as a scholar. Then I had niggles throughout that season, so I didn’t play as much under Steven <b>[Gerrard]</b> as I would have liked, which was obviously tough because he’s a legend and a role model. To not be able to play under him as much as I would have liked was quite tough mentally. But I seem to have come through it quite well, and I think it has shaped me into the player I am. Mentally it has helped a lot to know you can overcome those things<br /><br />The support I had from the staff was great. They were basically telling me that they know what I’m capable of and they know that, when I get back from injury, they believe that I will be able to get back to the same ability that I was before. They just told me to focus on my rehab, to get stronger and use it as an advantage in the gym, to be able to come back bigger and stronger.<br /><br /><b>[Glatzel’s partnership with Bobby Duncan]</b> We both like to score goals but at the end of the day it’s all about the team. We both see that, so there is no rivalry. We work for the team, all the players work for the team, and it doesn’t matter who scores as long as we are creating chances and winning games<br /><br /><b>[He laughs when asked to compare himself to the more extrovert Duncan]</b> I think I’m a bit more reserved! He likes his social media and all that, but he’s a good lad. We all like him here, we’re mates as well<br /><br />I think what’s happening with the first-teams gives it an extra edge. They are fighting for titles, and we want to be emulate what they are doing. It gives us that push to win titles as well. We will be prepared, we will be ready. We want this.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Glatzel believes his new <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> contract is a massive show of faith from the club as he recovers from his long-term knee injury]</b> I was disappointed to get my injury at the start of the season, but it’s a great feeling and it shows that the club has got faith in me. Now I can just focus on my rehab and get back on the pitch. The contract makes it easier. It’s massive. Mentally, it’s good to be able to focus on the rehab and know that there’s people that have faith in me and they know I’ll come back from my injury stronger and I’ll be ready when I’m back on the pitch<br /><br />Knowing that I’ve done it before helps a lot because I know I’ve got the mindset for it and I know I can do it. It’s just the long process and I’ve got to believe in myself and trust the physios as well. I know I can do it, so it will help me. I was looking forward to pre-season, I’d done quite a bit in the summer to be ready for pre-season because I thought I might get an opportunity. Obviously half an hour in or whatever, and it’s all come tumbling down and the season is gone for me. But with this contract now hopefully I’ve got the <b>[future]</b> to make an impact<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on the aftermath of the injury]</b> It was quite a tough time, to be honest. I was quite low, probably the lowest I’ve been. Even though I’ve had quite a few injuries, that was probably the toughest to take just because I was on such a high and I was doing quite well. The days after weren’t a great place but everyone got around me and I’m in a good place now just getting ready for the rehab and getting back</p>
