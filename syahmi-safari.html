  <p><b>[Maniam providing best care to avoid burnout to youngster Syahmi Safari]</b> First of all I want to thank the coach <b>[Maniam]</b> for putting his trust in me. After six games I’ve grown more confident and familiar with the MSL, playing alongside and against more-experienced players. As a young player, playing against national team-level oppositions, they will try and beat me, so I have to keep 100% focus and not let them get past me. And the more senior teammates have been encouraging and motivating me.<br /><br />What’s important for me at the moment is to keep my place in the team and help them. It doesn’t matter who scores, as long as the team come first</p>

  <p><b>[Youngster Syahmi Safari has played in all but eight minutes of Selangor’s 14 competitive matches this season]</b> <b>[My improved fitness]</b> is because I’ve been playing a lot, so the match fitness has carried over <b>[to the Malaysia U22 training]</b>. I didn’t have a long break after the Pahang match <b>[Selangor’s last league match before the break on May 24]</b>, so my fitness level did not drop.<br /><br /><b>[Many of his Selangor teammates have returned to their hometowns or taken a vacation for the break]</b> Of course I’m a little jealous that I get no time off. But this is my responsibility, the path I’ve chosen<br /><br />Coach Maniam told us that in July we’ll be playing 11 matches in the space of one month, so there’ll be player rotation as the gaps between the matches will be too short</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor’s Syahmi Safari admires Antoine Griezmann]</b> Although he is a striker, I’ve always admired his passing technique and ball control, as well as his decision-making in tight situations.</p>

  <p><b>[Rising Selangor young star Syahmi Safari is expected to be out of action for between one to three weeks due to the ankle injury he picked up earlier this week]</b> According to the doctor’s report yesterday, I was expected to be sidelined for three weeks. But the doctor observed that my rehabilitation has been taking place quicker, so he revised it to one week.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the current club vs country predicament happening with Malaysia U22]</b> The problem with clubs refusing to release their players has been going on for sometime, and they do have their own valid reasons. Those of us who are here are taking things positively, just waiting for the rest of the team to get here</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia winger Syahmi Safari is likely to start against rivals Singapore, in their matchday 2 Group A SEA Games clash]</b> I’ve noticed the Singapore squad is comprised of many newcomers this time around, so they will be a different side. Anything can happen in football, we are not entirely sure of their tactics so we only need to focus on our gameplay and avoid underestimating them.</p>

  <p><b>[Ahead of JDT clash, Syahmi Safari wants to forget SEA Games disappointment]</b> We’ll be facing JDT <b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim]</b> this Saturday and I hope everything will go according to plan. I did not get to play much in the SEA Games so now I have to capture my rhythm again. I have to forget it as it’s now all in the past and I have to take it as a valuable experience. I need to use that experience from the SEA Games in the remaining domestic matches.<br /><br />Nothing is impossible in football as long as we work hard to reach the next stage. This Saturday’s match is very important, as it will determine the group winner</p>
