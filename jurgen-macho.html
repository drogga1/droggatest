  <p><b>[Abramovich’s first signing Austrian goalkeeper Jurgen Macho on the early days of the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> revolution]</b> Sunderland let me go and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> came in and it was an honour that such a big club came in to sign me. Everything went so fast because I knew I had to try to take this big opportunity. I knew I had to do something big to make it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I had a pre-season before the actual pre-season which started in my holidays. I thought I have to work hard to be 100 per cent right to get a shot to play. I knew the fight for places against <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a> was big. At the start, I was really happy there. I had so much power and energy. After a week, I tore my anterior cruciate ligament and it was heartbreaking. It was an awful feeling. I had invested so much and I couldn’t show what I could do. I knew after that it would be very tough to get back in.<br /><br /><b>[It was a sign of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s new ambitions]</b> They kept signing unbelievable players at that time and you would feel each one changing the dressing room. You would see Roman Abramovich around at all the games and he gave a lot to the club. I was trying to get back after such a long period out. It was a hard time for me. It was a great disappointment but that’s part of football. I never would complain about this because injuries are part of the game. You can be lucky to avoid them but it happens. Everyone at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> treated me with so much respect even if they were ready to let me go. That includes all the players, coaches and medical staff. I felt like part of the club even if I never played there. I feel like I earned to be signed by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I was proud to be part of it. I was also honest that there were superstars. <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> signed in pre-season when <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> came in. We worked a few times together and he was a fantastic sportsman, helpful and a good guy. He became an incredible goalkeeper and proved it in his career; even then, you could see how much he had to offer. I was unlucky; it made it difficult for me and another reason that I had to move on<br /><br /><b>[He watches <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> from afar and he can see a bit of himself in <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> amid a troubling season for the £71 million (€80m/$87m) signing from Athletic Club]</b> It is not right to speak about why Kepa made his mistakes. The thing is that he cost a lot of money so some people think he must save everything and be at the top. Every goalkeeper has bad spells.<br /><br />When you have a bad spell, it is about how you pick yourself up. After that you have to work hard again and maybe start again to put yourself back to the level that you think you can give to your club. It is unfair to pick out individual mistakes. As a goalkeeper, I know that you can have spells where you try everything and it doesn’t work out. You need to keep up that fight; then you get that chance again. He did that and took his chance and it gives you a good feeling. I think the competition being high with <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Willy Caballero</a> is good and it can make you better. I am sure he will aim to keep fighting. There’s only one spot for a goalkeeper and you fight for that.<br /><br /><b>[Having missed out on his dream to make it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, Macho would be open to the idea of returning to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in the future as a coach]</b> I am the similarly ambitious as a coach as I was a player. Maybe one day I would like to work in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to work at the highest level of football but at the moment I am very happy at Rapid</p>

  <p><b>[The end of tiki-taka and gegenpressing? Football’s next tactical revolution]</b> Modern goalkeepers are more integrated in the game now. They play a big role football-wise during the game. They are now integrated in the tactics. Technically, you need to be able to play and this is the direction of travel in football. You also need to be even fitter. For me, it is important that a goalkeeper needs to still be good at making saves. That’s the core job to save balls first. That part will never change. But you have to now have both.<br /><br />In my way of playing the goalkeeper is very important. Years ago they were only really used for defending and kicking the ball forward, but now they need to build-up play and the make the right choices with the ball at their feet. There is a lot of attention on them now and it is nice if the ball goes to the keeper the he can play it out and make the right choice to one of his team-mates, rather than just launching it forward from deep and making them try and win it. That’s when you end up chasing the ball a lot, which is why a lot of coaches are now using the keepers and playing for possession.</p>
