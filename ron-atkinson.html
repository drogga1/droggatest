He’s not going to stay at Celtic for the rest of his management career and he is too young too pack up football because he is a football nut<br /><br /><b>[Big Ron summed up the Glasgow side’s colossal task against Man Utds]</b> It’s a bigger ask coming here now than it was in 2006.

  <p><b>[The former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager has been dogged by comments he made regarding <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Desailly</a> more than a decade ago and is tired of saying sorry]</b> He’s what is known in some schools as a f<strong>**</strong> lazy, thick n*****. <b>[…]</b> I am fed up of apologising - <b>[former England manager]</b> <a href="terry-venables.html">Terry Venables</a> rang me up once and he said: ‘When are you going to stop apologising?’ And I thought: ‘Ah, you’re right.’<br /><br />When other clubs wouldn’t use black players, I used plenty of them. Not because they were black but because they were good lads who could play<br /><br /><b>[In the modern era, with the lack of black managers viewed as a pressing issue in the fight for equality in British football, Atkinson believes the game is a meritocracy and opportunities are out there]</b> I’ve always thought it’s ability that gets you anywhere. Those black lads <b>[at West Brom]</b> didn’t get in because they were black. They got in because they were good enough. There’s a lot of talk about managers, there’s not enough English managers, let alone black managers.<br /><br />You know, there’s been any number of black managers, people forget. <b>[Brighton manager]</b> <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a> keeps getting jobs. He does a good job wherever he goes. Funnily enough, I mentioned <b>[former Fulham boss Jean]</b> Tigana earlier, he was a good manager. It’s just dawned on me that Tigana was black.

You realise that can happen to anyone. He was a defender that liked defending, he loved a full-blooded challenge. He didn’t have the best of starts for Villa and made a couple of blunders against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> that cost us the result, and it took him a long time to live that down.

  <p><b>[Ron Atkinson pays tribute to Cyrille Regis]</b> He got five international caps but today he would get 60 or 70 at least. I think he was the best centre-forward I’ve ever had and I’ve had some top players. But I also think he was a better bloke than a player. In full flow there wasn’t a better sight in football. Visiting fans took to him. I can remember us playing at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and we were all getting abuse, but he scored two wonder goals and afterwards he got a standing ovation from the <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> crowd</p>

  <p><b>[A man who once called the shots at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> believes patience is required on and off the field, with <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> needing time and trust]</b> <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> was on a six-year contract and thought he was on a rebuild from start to finish. At the time, they were talking about transition. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> don’t have a transitional period. Now I think United are in one - I don’t think for a minute they will make the top four.<br /><br /><a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> was certainly different. At times I thought he made <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> look like a shrinking violet. I was manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and also played against them. If you were the opposing manager at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, I would say, ‘As soon as you go out that door, be on your toes because they will come for you hell for leather in the first 20 minutes’.<br /><br />When I was in the other dugout I would say, ‘They’re expecting it, don’t disappoint them’. I don’t think Van Gaal bought into that. I was a big <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> fan but for some reason he didn’t lighten up enough for me. Instead of saying after a game, ‘We got away with that today’, he’d start putting fingers up saying, ‘I’ve won five’. Don’t do it.<br /><br />When he first came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> he was abrasive but funny abrasive. Maybe he can rediscover that at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I hope he does<br /><br /><b>[…patience has to be shown with somebody if the kind of consistency that United are crying out for is to be returned to their ranks]</b> Unless it’s an absolute disaster they should stick with what they’ve got until the end of the season at least. I think he should be given the January window. I know it’s not that easy to deal in it but his first three signings <b>[Harry <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>, <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> and Dan James]</b> are decent. If <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> had gone to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> they would win the league. The <b>[Mauricio]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> thing complicates it a bit. It was mentioned even when he was in a job at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Now he’s out of a job it will be talked about even more</p>
