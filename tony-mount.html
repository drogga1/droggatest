  <p><b>[What are Chelsea’s plans for on-loan Derby wonderkid Mason Mount?]</b> Mason is a sponge, he takes it all in. Even now, I was talking to Frank Lampard and he said to me, ‘Everything I say to him, he listens and takes on board.’ Lots of coaches have said that<br /><br />Mason met another kid who told him that they had a Soccer School there. We were like, ‘Relax son, why not swim?’ We are on holiday in Egypt. It was before he was signed at Chelsea. We eventually went over there to an indoor pitch and these coaches were wearing all black. It was two hours of football. I watched him and the kids were from all over, he loved it and played for a good few days. The coaches were from Manchester, they said they liked Mason Mount and they said they work for Manchester United and wanted to sign him and keep in touch<br /><br /><b>[following his call-up against Croatia and Spain]</b> I was in Australia with my daughter and wife. My wife and daughter burst into tears and I was bursting with pride. I just thought of the journey and what an honour it was. He trained with them ahead of Russia. Amazing experience for him too. He didn’t play but to be on the bench for Croatia and Spain was just elation, travelling all over Europe and going to London and back. It was a lot of work and commitment for Mason, he didn’t go to parties, social gatherings and we helped him as a family. He missed his sister’s wedding. Football has always come first for Mason. I can’t remember him missing a training session in the academy at Chelsea. He did his homework on the way to training and slept on the way back. Playing for England is a massive honour. We got back to England and flew straight to Seville. I saw him training with the squad, he didn’t get on but it was just amazing. An amazing match and experience for us all</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount: How midfielder ended <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s long wait for homegrown star]</b> No-one at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s academy has got into the first team since John Terry<br /><br /><b>[…]</b>If he hadn’t learned to kick a ball. I think he might have wanted to box, although I’m glad he never did<br /><br />We used to watch Pompey, but we’d also go and watch non-league games. When he was about 10 or 11, he turned to me and said: ‘Why doesn’t anyone pass the ball?’ I laughed and said: ‘Welcome to real football. Look at the tackling - tremendous<br /><br /><b>[Those who know him best insist the 21-year-old does not consider his journey complete]</b> What does Mason want to achieve next? He wants to win silverware, with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and England</p>
