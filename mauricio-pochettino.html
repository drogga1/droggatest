  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino believes Tottenham must add more quality to their squad if they are to challenge in both the Champions League and Premier League]</b> Maybe after five games we don’t show quality enough to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League. t was tough and that is good for us to learn and try for the future if next season we’re in the Champions League to make some changes. It was a good challenge for us to compete in the Champions League and to show our real level, that is always important.<br /><br />We reduced the gap at the top of the Premier League and that was our objective but to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League we need to show more and maybe add more quality to our squad. We have quality yes, to compete in the Premier League yes, but to share <b>[compete on multiple fronts]</b>? Maybe I can say we struggle a little bit.<br /><br />I am disappointed and upset with that game but in the same way I am quiet and calm because our project is not finished today, it’s only just started. It’s the first steps, the objective is to be in the Champions League regularly for when we get the new stadium<br /><br />It’s good for the club to be in the Europa League and to go further in the competition.

It was a little bit unlucky that we conceded the goal, because we deserved to go in at half-time <b>[winning]</b> 2-0 or 3-0 - never 1-1. I think we deserved more.<br /><br />In the second half, we conceded a goal very quickly, but we fought and competed. Then they had the chance and scored the second goal, and it was impossible. I’m disappointed for the dressing room, but we should be pleased with the way we competed. I think today we competed with a very good team. I have nothing to say about that to my players. If you put aside the result at the end, we had the possession, we created more than Chelsea and all the statistics are for us - but football is not about just statistics. We have to be clinical, and the chances that they created, they scored</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed his disappointment at club-record signing Moussa Sissoko, who he has suggested cares more about money than performances]</b> Football is not about money. It is about players being better and that they show on the training ground that they are better than another team-mate and that they deserve to be involved or not. In my opinion, I need to take the decisions and I believe that the players that started in the game and the players on the bench deserved to be involved in the game. There’s nothing else to it.<br /><br />It’s not frustrating for me. It’s about football. We can see in football different things that happen. You sign a player and then you expect something, and you don’t find what you expected. If another deserved to be involved, like maybe Josh Onomah or maybe <b>[Vincent]</b> Janssen then why <b>[Sissoko]</b>? Because we pay money, do they deserve to play?

That is his ambition.<br /><br />It is important for the club and for everyone - great news. We feel very happy because once more Harry is showing his commitment to the club and the project. That is great for us. It is fantastic for the player. It is important for him to be calm in his mind, focused on playing and improving. When players are involved in talks like these it can always affect them.<br /><br />Now the deal is done it is important to focus on the future, to train and improve and try to score the goals he needs to score. In two and a half years here I have always shown that Harry is involved in my plans. It is very important for the future of the club, not only for my plans but also for Tottenham’s in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has backed Dele Alli after the midfielder allegedly dived in the 5-0 win over Swansea City]</b> It’s too difficult to advise because you cannot recreate in the future the same situation and you cannot advise, ‘Don’t fall down or…’ - it’s too difficult. It’s too difficult to work like that. Dele is how he is. I didn’t talk with him and I need to speak with him to know what happened in that situation. Maybe he will say, ‘OK I fell down but I didn’t mean to dive but the referee believed it was a penalty’, or it wasn’t his intention, but it’s difficult now.<br /><br />It was 15 years ago when Owen dived. Don’t believe that English football is fair play always because Owen jumped like he was in a swimming pool. Come on. I didn’t touch him. I promise you. It’s true. I think today football is more global. England is more like European football. Now we have the influence of the Latin people that try to cheat always. Maybe you were more pure 20, 25, 30 years ago. Now you are like us<br /><br />In Argentina, yes the people sometimes practise that. It’s true, but many years ago. Now, I don’t know. But when I was a player, it was part of training to try to cheat. Yes, <b>[it was]</b> at Newell’s, Estudiantes, it was part of practice. No <b>[I don’t practise with my teams]</b>, of course not.

It’s a great opportunity to make Wembley our home. For the squad it’s important to be involved in different competitions. We have a lot of young players who need the experience of playing in Europe.<br /><br />Now it’s a good opportunity to show that we learn from our experience in the Champions League. I believe that it’s important for the club to be involved in the Europa League. We didn’t play well in the Champions League at Wembley, but it’s important for us to be involved in the Europa League. Why not try to go further in that competition?<br /><br /><b>[On Toby Alderweireld]</b> Toby will be involved in the squad. It’s important for him to be involved.

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino believes Tottenham are starting to show their real quality after they followed up Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Swansea City]</b> To win here, that was important for us, to change the bad feeling that was there after <b>[home Champions League defeats to]</b> Monaco and <b>[Bayer]</b> Leverkusen. It was very important that we recover. I think the performance was good. I think we are much better after Monaco - our performances against Chelsea <b>[in a 2-1 defeat]</b> and Swansea and today, we are playing better and starting to show our real quality. We struggled in the last month and a half because we had some problems, but now we have all the squad nearly fully fit. We are stronger and I think we have recovered that feeling that maybe we lost.<br /><br />In the last few years, Tottenham was always playing in the Europa League and that competition was really important for us. After fighting a lot last season to play Champions League, we can feel now a little disappointed about that, but the Europa League is an important competition. It’s a competition that can provide you the possibility to play again in the Champions League, and to win a trophy that is very important in Europe. It’s true that our challenge is always to be in the Champions League, but we know we are fighting with big sides and maybe we need to learn and improve in the next few seasons to try to play regularly in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says Jose Mourinho is still the Special One]</b> I like Mourinho and I have a good relationship with him. Many managers’ behaviour is worse than his but because he is the ‘Special One’, there is more of a focus on him. The refs focus on him, the media focus on him. Other managers are worse than him but they do not get the attention because they are not the ‘Special One’ like him. He’s the ‘Special One’ and always will be the ‘Special One’.<br /><br />He’s one of the best. In some periods in football, you struggle a little bit. It’s not easy to arrive at a new club and settle your ideas, your philosophy. For me he was and is one of the best managers in football history. nited’s Europa League excursions give Spurs more time to prepare for the match, having played in the Champions League on Wednesday.<br /><br />It’s true that we have one day more to prepare than them. It’s true that for us last season and the season before, it was tough to play Thursday and Sunday. I don’t remember in my two and a half years here that we have had the advantage of one day. But, when you play against a team like Manchester United they have the strong squad, always they can rotate players. That is their decision and we know that it will be a very tough game for us and Manchester United are a great team. I am sure that it will be a very competitive game</p>

I’m not disappointed with our performance. We competed in a difficult game. The chances we create were similar to what Manchester United created but they were clinical. We had a lack of reaction when we lost the ball and that was how we allowed them to score. We need to understand that our offensive players need to take a risk. We tried to play with our philosophy and we tried to create chances.<br /><br />We are in a good position and it is a long way to the end of the season. We’re not too concerned. The Premier League is tough. Chelsea started the season very badly and then they changed their system and look now how they are. We need to believe.

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has put his faith in striker Vincent Janssen and insists the Dutchman’s poor form is not an issue]</b> For me, it is not an issue. Janssen is not in his best moment but he is young, it is his first season and we have had a lot of chats with him. It’s normal. It’s all new for him and he needs to be relaxed, train hard, try to improve and when he has the opportunity to play show his quality. But it is not a major issue. We will see what happens on Saturday. The most important thing is we believe in him and trust in him. But it is not because in the last few months he has struggled a little bit in his performances that created doubts in us. I think if he has the possibility to play he is ready to give his best. If not he must wait on the bench for another opportunity but I have no doubt about him.<br /><br />I think the three can be available for Tuesday but for Saturday it is a big risk to try to play with them. It is a good opportunity for those players who don’t play regularly to show their qualities. It needs to be a priority. We are in the FA cup, Premier league and Europa League. Three big challenges. Why not? But sometimes you get minor problems, like Harry, Toby or Danny Rose too, as he has a knock on his knee and we need to do a scan. When you are involved in three competitions and you have 25 players, it is important in this type of game to give some responsibility to the players who are not too much involved in the Premier League or Europa League. But that does not mean the FA Cup is not an objective. For me, the FA Cup must be an objective - to try to <b>[get]</b> as far as possible. It’s not an excuse. Every time that we play, Tottenham plays. If you are involved you need to give your best and show your quality. If you want to be long term in Tottenham, and deserve to wear the shirt, it’s a great opportunity to show it on Saturday</p>

They are so strong there, we suffered a bit, it is true. But I think overall, we played much better. The good thing I’ve seen is that the team competed. The team fought, played well, and created chances. The three points are very important for us</p>

During different games, a lot of situations like this happen. The problem now is that we are so sensitive about the situation, and then we are so focused on Dele Alli. It’s too much sometimes. There is such a focus on this type of situation. I think it’s a minimal issue. Look, there are a lot of positives from Dele. Of course, he’s not perfect. Nobody is perfect. Of course, he is a clever boy. He is a little bit nasty. The problem is that, more than this type of situation, I am worried we are going to change the game that we know.<br /><br />Football is a creative sport in which you need the talent that grows in a very intelligent person, a very smart brain. And now we are so focused on minimal details. I am worried that in a few years, we are pushing the sport we love now - a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world - into a very rigid structure. With VAR, with focusing too much on small actions like this. Football is about trying to trick your opponent - yes or no? Tactics - what does ‘tactic’ mean? When you do tactics, it is to try to trick the opponent. You play on the right, but you finish on the left. Twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we all congratulated a player when he tricks the referee like this. That is the football that I was in love with when I was a child. Yes, in Argentina, but in England too. You believe that in England you were honest and always perfect?<br /><br /> am worried that maybe we are going to kill the game. We love this game. Referees are humans too, and sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not right. In 10 months, over the whole season, sometimes it is against you, sometimes it is for you.

If we cannot do that, we need to try to be creative and, of course, the help of younger players will be amazing and they showed they can help us if, in the end, we cannot sign players</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham may be forced to play their Premier League game against Manchester City on a damaged Wembley pitch]</b> At the moment, I cannot say we are not going to play this game at our new stadium. If you ask me if we can’t play in the new stadium, we need to find a way to play at Wembley. To play in another place, three stadiums in one season, would be too much. Maybe we need to adapt, the day after the NFL game, maybe the pitch is not in the best condition, but we need to make the effort and to play because to find another date would be difficult. I am a person who is always positive. Rather than complain about a thing you cannot change, I try to find a solution to help the performance in the best way.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the fans. I want to say thank you and apologise and try to reward them by winning games. That’s the only way we can pay back all the work they have been doing for club. I think we all feel disappointed of course with the announcement from club this week. I feel so sorry for myself, for the players, the fans, everyone. I feel sorry for chairman, he tried with everyone to arrive on time, he made a massive effort</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that several of Tottenham’s players could be on the move before the close of the European transfer window]</b> Maybe, yes, we are going to see if some players believe that they can achieve their goals in another club. Maybe they are going to move. Different individual things can happen in the next few weeks. If some player is not happy because he needs to play or believes he can play more at another team, or needs to change the environment, or needs a new challenge or motivation, I told them that I am open to find the solution. I want people who feel happy to be involved here every day, happy to be in the place that the manager, who is the boss, puts you, and I think that is the only way to success. If we are 25 players, 40 or 50 staff, fans, board altogether, working for the same objective, which is to win games. That is why I am so open to fix problems. I don’t want anyone upset or unhappy, or with negative feelings here. It is so clear the rules. It is so clear my message. I promise I am going to fix it if someone is not happy to be here for the next five months until the transfer window opens again. All people here need to feel they can be part of the team, and help the team any time the manager commands.<br /><br /><b>[On Luke Amos]</b> I’m so happy with our young players who won the ICC tournament. Of course, I laugh a little bit but we played with 17 or 18-year-old midfielders. Why not show them trust and that there’s a possibility of getting to the first team, maybe not for now, but in a few months or to prepare them for next season?</p>

Maybe <b>[if he learns this]</b> he will play at a very good level and be one of the best midfielders in England. If he wants to take my advice, take it.

If I am responsible for picking a starting XI, I need to take the responsibility, I cannot ask the fans who should play. And I know the consequences if I don’t pick right and get a good result.

We’ll see, we need to assess him and we’ll see what happens, what’s going on after, to be training and resting with a plan to improve his problem. He cannot cope with 90 minutes and that’s why we cannot make another mistake because after, in this busy fixture <b>[period]</b>. It’s difficult to play with some players thinking that you need to manage the bench because maybe he won’t arrive to complete the 90 minutes. That’s why we need to be sure next time we think about putting him in to play that we’re right and that he’s going to cope with the 90 minutes. After, something can happen in football and you cannot avoid 100 per cent the risk, but it’s so important to be right and of course thinking about trying to help him always, like we’re thinking for all the players</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has declared himself happy with his situation at the club]</b> Tottenham has given me value. I feel happy here in Tottenham because I feel the recognition for our job. We feel that. When (club chairman) Daniel Levy extended my contract for five years, it is because he believed in that moment and period, we are the best people to manage this boat and this club. It is recognition for us. I don’t need to listen about what goes around. The most important thing is how you are made to feel in your home.<br /><br />We try to improve but the way that we improve is not in the way of maybe another team. That is why our project is to be consistent in many years and try to improve every season, and we will see whether it is enough or not. At the moment it is clear that Manchester City is above everyone. It is City again and Liverpool. I think the most important thing is to keep going and fighting to be in a good position. Like many clubs say, to be in the top four is a massive success. And for us to be in the top four is more than success. I think the first step is to try and be consistently in the top four</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino believes the Premier League should delay the introduction of VAR despite Tottenham benefiting from technology in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg]</b> is a good idea to delay <b>[VAR’s introduction to the Premier League]</b> because if we don’t have all the information or don’t know how it will work or how we can better develop the system, it is better to stop for one year or more.<br /><br />Nobody in Europe is happy with VAR and what worries me is that there is going to be a situation where football starts to annoy the fans. If you stop for five minutes for a decision, I don’t know how they are going to behave.<br /><br />Goal-line technology is the best but, after that, it is about how the referee perceives things. The emotion is not going to be there, the feelings and the tension. Maybe technically it is a handball but we know very well when it is intentional and only the referee and the players around can decide that. On the video, you cannot perceive that.<br /><br />That’s because the game in England is more dynamic. If you compare to Spain or Italy, the ball is in play more in England. Fans in this country are used to play, transition, corner, goal, boom. It is more instant. In the Rochdale replay there was an incident in the first half that took forever to decide. There were 10,000 less fans after half-time. That situation was difficult to accept and I’m not sure if you get a benefit. Those who are pro‑VAR say the technology will help but football is also about mistakes - players, managers and referees. I am telling the people responsible that we need information <b>[on why and when VAR should be used]</b> because if we don’t know, it is going to be a big problem</p>

He’s like this in his effort with and without the ball, he’s very regular and consistent and that is most important. Sonny is like when you have a battery, you work, work, work and then the battery is gone. He is like this, he gives you everything and when he’s exhausted he says: ‘I need to change’ or <b>[that he]</b> needs to rest. He’s like this. Always on the pitch he’s 100 percent in every action without or without the ball. That is the most important thing, it’s a very good example for everyone, watching him play. Of course after the first season, he understood what we expected of him. Now if you see him, he’s one of the players who is always moving on the pitch, trying to get the best position in defensive and offensive situations. Always giving options to team-mates, running forward, dropping and then arriving from the second line. He is a very complete player today and we are so happy with his performance<br /><br />It’s not about the distance, it’s about the quality of the run. You can run 12km but if you don’t have sprints or beat your opponent, and depends how you run it’s not going to affect the game. The most important thing is how you run and how you affect the game and the capacity and quality. It’s not about distance. It’s like if you say Messi ran a lot of distance. No, but in the distance he applied the pace, or how powerful he is in the moment which made the difference. Sonny is similar, the quality is top because he has a lot of quality in his movement</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says Virgil van Dijk has proved to be worth more than the £75 million Liverpool spent to sign him]</b> When a team like Liverpool need to improve their team in a certain area, people said it was crazy to pay £70m for a centre-back. But Liverpool were right. They picked Van Dijk, because at that moment they believed he was the best centre-back in England who could make them better, and they were right. Some people said, ‘Why would you pay £70m for a centre-back?’ But the people who believed other things have now been shown that Liverpool were right. If you are going to sign the player who is going to improve your team, then it is not a lot of money. Because when you consider what it means to win a Champions League or a Premier League, it is cheaper to spend this type of money.<br /><br />We have good players. We are good enough, but the problem is that if we are not playing like a team. The first half against Southampton (2-1 defeat) was the perfect example. The first half the performance was good but in the second half we played 11 different games and what happened, happened. That’s what worried me a little bit and we need to recover our memories and our feeling that we need to fight altogether and we need to show the real quality altogether like a team. That is more important than the individual</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino will not be taking the reins at Manchester United or Real Madrid any time soon]</b> It does not depend only on me, it’s about Daniel <b>[Levy]</b>. Of course I know he is happy with me and that is what he is telling me. But I understand Tottenham is bigger than one person. Tottenham is bigger than one player, Tottenham is bigger than everything. Always, you need to feel my position here is I need to fight every day to keep my position. That doesn’t mean I am not comfortable. Always I tell Jesus (Perez, assistant manager), we need to think that maybe tomorrow if we don’t care about our position maybe we can go away quick. Football changes the same very quickly. It’s difficult to say I am now happy and sure I will be here next season. If, I said that and something wrong happened and I’m not here then you say: ‘Oh Pochettino said he will be here and now he’s not here’. I don’t say because maybe the rumour can be true or Daniel can say: ‘It’s enough, I need another manager’. In my mind, always I am living today can be the last day, tomorrow can be the last day. That is my philosophy. Look at what happened at Real Madrid. Zidane said, ‘I go’, then two managers and not even the end of the season and he’s back. Who believed that? That is why in football, you must respect football because everything that today is white, tomorrow is black and then white again. I try to live with this respect and knowing things can turn so quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Pochettino hails Tottenham ‘heroes’ after Champions League semi-final comeback]</b> It is still difficult to call. It’s emotional. It’s amazing. Thank you football. Thank you these guys, my players are heroes. In the last year I have been telling everyone that I have a group of players who are heroes. The second half was amazing. This type of emotion, without football, it’s impossible to live. I am so emotional now. Thank you to our fans and the people who believed in us from the beginning of the season. I think it’s fantastic. It’s difficult to describe. We were talking before the game that when you work and when you feel the love, it’s not stress, it’s a passion. I think the emotion we showed today was passion. We love this sport that is football. I think the game against Man City <b>[in the quarter-finals]</b> and today, it’s amazing. For us it was so tough, it was difficult to compete at this level. It’s a massive competition. I am so grateful to be a coach, to be in football, and to be leading this type of team.<br /><br />All heroes, but <b>[Moura]</b> is a superhero. Unbelievable hat-trick. He deserved it. He’s a good guy. I think everyone deserved it from the first one to the last one in this club. To be in this moment right here, to have the chance to play in the final is amazing. I want to remember my family, it’s for them too. It’s for the people who passed, in that moment, it’s amazing to reward them. We need to be ready for the next game on Sunday <b>[against Everton]</b> and be ready then for the final in Madrid</p>

The way they have behaved so professionally and what they have achieved is unbelievable. Four top-four finishes, four Champions League qualifications and the cherry on the cake will be the Champions League final. This group of players deserve so much credit. They have put so much unbelievable effort in. There have been many positives this season. The players and staff have shown so much character. We broke down all the doors when the circumstances were against us with the new stadium stuff. So, to see their capacity to fight again makes me so proud.

  <p><b>[Proud Mauricio Pochettino targets another Champions League final after <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defeat]</b> I feel very proud about their effort, how we fight. We were unlucky, we conceded a goal on a penalty. We were fighting, and we played so well in the second half. I feel so proud, a little bit unlucky. To start 1-0 down from the start was tough, we changed our plans but we are very proud of these players and these fans. We can be optimistic. That <b>[penalty]</b> was the circumstance we cannot manage or prepare for. You can never believe you will be 1-0 down after a minute.<br /><br />Mentally it was very tough, it’s about learning and experience, like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were in this position last year. I am so pleased to manage this group of players, but congratulations to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The standards are so high, it wasn’t enough today. It’s a shame. You want to experience this again and repeat it. It is the best game in the world after the World Cup.

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino is hoping to finally add some silverware to his trophy cabinet with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> this season]</b> A good season for us? My personal feeling is that starting my sixth season I need to lift a trophy - Carabao Cup, FA Cup, <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> or Champions League. It’s like my dog - he’s growing up, he’s just not quite mature enough. I don’t want to put pressure on the team or the club. But if you ask me personally, this season is not about finishing in the top four to be successful - although of course maybe that matters for the club. But for me, it is about winning some title<br /><br />After last season’s final, to be again in the top four and reach the semi-final of the Carabao Cup, it is like, ‘Come on!’. You are always there but you cannot touch the glory. That is personally - me. My personal target, objective, aim to be successful this season, is to lift a trophy</p>

If you compare with us, we have eight or nine still in the starting XI. Look at the difference. You know very well that the debt of our club is £600m with the banks and, for sure, when you are delivering a project that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been delivering in the last five years, you cannot compare with another club.

He was fantastic, and of course he dropped a little bit in his performance, but we need to help and to back him, not to pay attention too much and try to improve and be strong again<br /><br /><b>[Pochettino is calling for his players to be positive as they look to get their season back on track]</b> It was an important week to recover feelings after a tough game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was important again to create that atmosphere that you want. It’s a situation that only we can fix, winning games. We need to be positive - that positivity makes us believe we can beat any team. At the moment, we struggle a little bit, we drop a lot in our confidence. The most important thing is how we’re going to finish. It’s not nice to see yourself in the middle of the table, but that is our reality and we need to accept it. If you do not accept reality, you’re going to struggle. In our minds, we know very well we need time, to be strong, be solid, and start winning because that’s going to be the best thing for us<br /><br />In general, always managers want players at home. For <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Giovani Lo Celso</a>, it’s going to be tough because, again, when he’s nearly fit to start again, he needs to go away and changing the dynamic of the training session, something can happen. Being honest, I am not happy, but I accept <b>[it]</b> because I always defend the national team and I always back the decision of the national team. I was a player - I know how it feels to play for your flag. What can I do? Nothing, only to show or describe my feelings</p>

  <p><b>[Pochettino encourages <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> to rediscover the devil within]</b> We know very well that Dele is going to be back. His mentality is good. After a tough period, always you need time to recover the feelings and performance. As long as you are consistent and working hard, you are going to arrive again because the quality is there. It’s still there inside of him. We spoke with him about improving different areas. But for sure the devil is going to appear again. I don’t know when. But for sure it will. If you go back, we all criticised him. But remember I said I said I liked this <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>. Because sometimes players being a bit naughty makes that difference<br /><br />Dele is capable again of performing in the way the he expects and his family expects, us, the club. When you show the qualities he showed when he was a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old, when you drop it is normal that people are going to criticise because they find it difficult to understand why you drop in terms of assists or goals in your game. But in every single talented young player, at some point the level drops. Some players need more or less time again to be in the best form. I think every coach must support, back your player and help your player because when Dele was scoring goals it was easy to embrace him but now when he is maybe not at his best, it is the most difficult to embrace him and say I trust in you and you are going to have time to be again the best. It is easy now to criticise him</p>

We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over. To take the decision it has, the board must have a clear plan for what and who comes next. It needs to tell this club’s supporters what that plan is. And the board also needs to consider its own role in this.<br /><br />Is the manager solely accountable? How much has the board’s line on wages and transfers contributed to player unrest and disaffection? How much did it contribute to the situation we now find ourselves in?

To destroy <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> and to build a new stadium, to play at Wembley and Milton Keynes, only football people know how difficult it was to deal with these situations. To apply a new philosophy and new ideas was very tough but I feel very proud with the success that we had and to take <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to a different level. To play in the Champions League for three or four years and finish above <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> many times was a great legacy for us. To win a title would be a great reward but for us that is the legacy, to have the club and the stadium at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. That is more than winning titles<br /><br />The young English managers today have the influence of the European people. Before, English football was closed. It was difficult to share and mix here but the European coaches have been influential. People have been more open to discover a different type of football. When I first arrived at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> the players would say you have to play long balls in behind the full-backs and press, the approach was always like this. To change this mentality was tough but you can see a different style in football now and that makes <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the best league in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino claims Heung-min Son would no longer be at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> had he not pushed for the South Korean to be cleared for Asian Games duty in 2018]</b> With <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> injured, Son not playing the first few months because of the Asian Games, no one talks about that. Today, Sonny is at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> because we allowed him to go and play two competitions that weren’t compulsory, not being selfish and saying, ‘No, Sonny needs to stay here’. If not, two years and you need to stop the contract with Son. No one says anything about that. It was our decision to provide him the time to go<br /><br /><b>[On how things started to unravel for him]</b> Monday <b>[after the final]</b>, I was thinking to build again, because when you are so competitive and you are a winner, you are not stuck in the past. You lose, but you want to win again tomorrow. I wasn’t knocked because we didn’t win the final, we wanted to take a massive experience for us, learn and be ready again for the next season. We were fighting for the top four at the same time we were fighting to be in the Champions League final. If you lift the trophy, you are very successful. But second is a failure, no? We are not thinking like this but, of course, that makes you sad. Of course people recognise the job was fantastic, but to finish winning the Champions League would have been amazing</p>

I am so motivated for the next project. But, deep inside, I would like to be back one day because the club is special.

  <p><b>[Pochettino: I couldn’t stop crying after Champions League final loss]</b> I think it was very difficult to accept the way the game went. I was so disappointed afterwards. It was difficult to stop crying, to stop feeling bad. When you prepare for three weeks with the responsibility and in the way we did, and worked, with all the staff and players. We were very focused. I think we were convinced and I was convinced that the final was going to go our way. That was completely in our minds. But no one is prepared after 30 seconds of the Champions League final to concede like that<br /><br />The goal changed the whole game, all the emotions. It is difficult to prepare a team for that happening<br /><br />It was a massive achievement. And you can use the example of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after they lost to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> the season before, that was a massive motivation and inspiration to be back in the future. But I knew after five years and with the way we were working, all the things that happened, it was going to be difficult to change a little bit in our minds and to stay open to design another plan, or a strategy to build again, a different chapter. A different project was going to be difficult to maintain - to keep improving<br /><br />I said to Daniel that we finished in the way that no one wanted but the end, because of our commitment, our emotion and our feeling - in football - it needed to happe. If not, our relationship would have continued forever! And maybe that’s no good for the club or for us. When the decision came it was right and we needed to move on</p>

Jose says: ‘OK, these are for your kids to wear from now on’. We have kept a good relationship since then and I am so happy he is at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, replacing me. I am happy as well to have left the club in the condition that we left it and for sure he is very grateful for the way that we helped to build the club, which is now his club<br /><br />I always think I’d replace him. He was at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I say: ‘Oh, maybe one day I can take your place at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>,’ but look at how life works out.

Unbelievable, eh?<br /><br />Before the pandemic, me and Jesus <b>[Perez, his former assistant as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> met with Unai for a coffee, to talk and share our experiences. We were working in different clubs, we were at the enemy, and people were walking past and saying: ‘Unai and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and Jesus are now sharing a coffee!’ It was in Cockfosters <b>[in north London]</b>. It was very funny. It has been an amazing time to review and analyse everything: training sessions, games, our methodology, our models of training … to design specific and collective works. And, of course, to try to adapt for the new normality, to be ready for any eventuality, because the demands are going to be completely different. We are looking forward for the next job. Football is very dynamic and you need to be ready for the moment when the offer appears. We are ready. After six months, our tanks are completely full</p>

  <p><b>[Pochettino open to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return amid <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> links]</b> I love England. My idea is to keep living in London but at the same time, I am open to different countries, to listen and see what happens. I am ready and we are a much better coaching staff now. We have learnt a lot from our experiences at Espanyol, <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. We have a lot to provide to the people that will trust in us in the future<br /><br />I need to behave in the way that I did on my first day as a coach. There are two things that are most important - one is the people, the fans that are behind every club. That is the structure that keeps alive all the companies that provide the entertainment that is football. The other is the ideas of the clubs. Every single club and company have different cultures, different philosophies, different ways of working. They all have different plans for success. To be successful at one club you need to win the Champions League or <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, but for others it is to finish in the top four or six. For <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it was to build a new stadium and at the same time create a team to compete and cut the gap to the top four. Every single club has different aims and you as a coaching staff need to stick to these ideas. In the end, when we are waiting for a new offer, and we are capable of providing what a club expects from us, we are going to be very happy.<br /><br />The problem is which clubs are top six?. The top six always changes. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is not in the top six, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is not in the top six. You need to respect all the clubs. All the clubs are working so hard and investing money. Every season clubs have ambition to be top six or top four. I don’t think you can underestimate any club<br /><br />We are going to live a completely different era in football that we need to discover. How are these clubs or companies, because that’s what they are, going to be after this virus hopefully disappears? It’s a big question mark. That’s why it’s so difficult to know what project is going to be the right project. We are a coaching staff that are very receptive to listen to all the projects, all the people. We can learn from every single conversation and maybe we can see a motivation to go with them.</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino believes no team has had a bigger impact upon English football than the <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> side he coached for a season and a half from January 2013]</b> Football in England changed with that <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> team of 2013-14, there is no other team that had as big an impact in changing the mindset. We arrived at a club with a president like Nicola Cortese who gave us what we needed to create something unique in English football. Our ability to adapt to a completely different environment was incredible. We found a group of players who wanted to learn from the experiences we brought from Spanish football, and with the quality to play a different style of football to that which everyone in English football was used to. Young players started to appear, and people started to trust in young players, also in the English national team.<br /><br />At Espanyol, we were the first coaching staff who started to teach exercises to bring the ball out from the back. The facts are there. Just watch any game from around 2010 and 2011, the ball is played out from the goal. When previously it was always hit long. We started with that, and many people are a bit surprised. Everyone talks of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Madrid, Milan. No, no, it was Espanyol, with Ernesto Galan, Jordi Amat, Raul Rodriguez, David Lopez, Didac Vila, Victor Ruiz, Raul Baena, Juan Forlin, <a href="javi-marquez.html">Javi Marquez</a>. Many of those players grew up with a style of play and philosophy different from modern football played today.</p>

He only communicated whether the club were going to accept the offer. Nothing more. It wasn’t a conversation - Do you want me? Or don’t you want me?</p>
