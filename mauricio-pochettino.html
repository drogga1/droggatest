We didn’t play well. Very disappointed with our performance and the result in the end. Again we conceded a very cheap goal in the first half and then it was difficult. They showed that they were very well organised with their defensive line and they were very compact. For us we weren’t capable of breaking down their organisation<br /><br /><b>[Pochettino put the sterility of Spurs’ dominance down to a lack of desire]</b> We created some chances. Not too many, not enough to be honest. That is why we’re very disappointed with the performance and the result but we cannot justify our performance. We should be playing better, more desire, more capacity to be more aggressive in this type of game, because 80 per cent of possession is too much for only a few shots on target<br /><br /><b>[VAR reviewed the incident and upheld the referee’s decision]</b> Look, I am going to have the chance now to see it, but I trust and am fully committed to the VAR. Of course before starting working with the VAR I was critical because I didn’t like it before but in the moment that we all accept the VAR and rules we have to accept the element that is going to help the referee to make better decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Pochettino backs <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> to overcome ‘massive pressure’ and rediscover <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> form]</b> We need to remember that Dele is so young and the demand, the pressure on him is massive. Everyone expects big things: he’s English, he’s an international, but he’s still 23 years old. He was fantastic, and of course he dropped a little bit in his performance, but we need to help and to back him, not to pay attention too much and try to improve and be strong again<br /><br /><b>[Pochettino is calling for his players to be positive as they look to get their season back on track]</b> It was an important week to recover feelings after a tough game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was important again to create that atmosphere that you want. It’s a situation that only we can fix, winning games. We need to be positive - that positivity makes us believe we can beat any team. At the moment, we struggle a little bit, we drop a lot in our confidence. The most important thing is how we’re going to finish. It’s not nice to see yourself in the middle of the table, but that is our reality and we need to accept it. If you do not accept reality, you’re going to struggle. In our minds, we know very well we need time, to be strong, be solid, and start winning because that’s going to be the best thing for us<br /><br />In general, always managers want players at home. For <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Giovani Lo Celso</a>, it’s going to be tough because, again, when he’s nearly fit to start again, he needs to go away and changing the dynamic of the training session, something can happen. Being honest, I am not happy, but I accept <b>[it]</b> because I always defend the national team and I always back the decision of the national team. I was a player - I know how it feels to play for your flag. What can I do? Nothing, only to show or describe my feelings</p>

  <p><b>[Pochettino encourages <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> to rediscover the devil within]</b> We know very well that Dele is going to be back. His mentality is good. After a tough period, always you need time to recover the feelings and performance. As long as you are consistent and working hard, you are going to arrive again because the quality is there. It’s still there inside of him. We spoke with him about improving different areas. But for sure the devil is going to appear again. I don’t know when. But for sure it will. If you go back, we all criticised him. But remember I said I said I liked this <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>. Because sometimes players being a bit naughty makes that difference<br /><br />Dele is capable again of performing in the way the he expects and his family expects, us, the club. When you show the qualities he showed when he was a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old, when you drop it is normal that people are going to criticise because they find it difficult to understand why you drop in terms of assists or goals in your game. But in every single talented young player, at some point the level drops. Some players need more or less time again to be in the best form. I think every coach must support, back your player and help your player because when Dele was scoring goals it was easy to embrace him but now when he is maybe not at his best, it is the most difficult to embrace him and say I trust in you and you are going to have time to be again the best. It is easy now to criticise him</p>

Maybe that showed a little bit our frustration in the game because up until 83 minutes the team were alive, we were fighting, trying to create chances to score a third goal and we were still in the game. But they were very clinical. Of course we are so disappointed. I cannot say another thing other than I feel very very disappointed. I feel so bad because when you concede seven goals it is tough, but you need to face up to this type of situation. When you play the final of the Champions League, it was nice to put your face up after the wins we had at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. Now I have to put my same face up and accept we were not as good as we expected<br /><br /><b>[Having reached impressive heights last season, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> believes this campaign will be a difficult one for the club as it looks to refocus]</b> This is going to be a tough ­season. After the final of the Champions League, it was a chapter closed and now the club is in a period when they need to open another chapter and decide a ­project, medium, long-term. You need to show your quality like a man first, to face the situation like a man. You need to use your quality, how you are strong, to face this type of situation. What comes after is the professional side. Now we need to be a man and be strong all together to try to bounce back and change that feeling. I think it’s more psychological now. To try to move on and make sure there is no damage between us and talking in different ways to each other. The most important thing now is to have one idea, one analysis, one assessment. We need to stick with this assessment and, from there, start to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino has admitted to being worried about the extra workload a new documentary centred on <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will create for his staff]</b> When the club agreed the deal with Amazon, of course we were worried about it. Because it is not easy, not easy. It is tough to have the camera in your office, and then how you handle the situation to have the capacity to say, ‘Okay, I am not in a good mood, but sometimes the camera is going to be there’. It is so complicated, it is another thing to worry about and of course that adds a lot. If we were busy, now we are super busy. To plan every day, everything, is not an easy job. That is why, when I told you I feel that I am not any more a manager, I am a coach, now I am like a producer. Being coach, manager and producer!<br /><br /><b>[While concerned about the internal effects of the documentary, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has fewer fears about the depiction of his team in desperate times, such as the humiliating 7-2 loss to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> It’s going to be the reality. It is like when we started to do the book <b>[Brave New World: Inside <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>’s <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> one season. It was the same risk. It is most important to live the reality, not to try to generate something that is fake or not real, and then what you are going to love, what the people are going to love to see, is that we are normal people working. We can win, we can lose. Like the book, I hope there is a happy ending. But if not, you are going to see another point of view, from a different vision</p>

The penalty was given and we need to accept it’s the decision of the referee or the VAR<br /><br />This season, we have deserved to get more points in the table. These things happen and that is the moment to stay stronger. Maybe in different seasons this type of situation results in 2-0 or 3-0 for us in the second half but today it was a different way</p>

I never complain about the VAR, but please let us use it in the best way. It changes the spirit of football. It is creating a big, big mess.</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> Supporters’ Trust (THST) has thanked Mauricio Pochettino following his sacking]</b> We’re shocked and saddened to hear our club has sacked Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff. During his time at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, Poch gave us many of our best moments as supporters, made <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> a force to be reckoned with again, and forged a strong link with the fans. We will never forget the joy he brought us. Of course, results in the league have been disappointing for some time. But many fans thought Poch had earned the right to turn it around in the first sustained period of poor form we’ve had during his time at the club. We now have to look forward and take stock. But there are questions that must be asked of the board<br /><br />The club’s statement makes it clear the board has decided to sack the manager and coaching staff. It is their decision. We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over. To take the decision it has, the board must have a clear plan for what and who comes next. It needs to tell this club’s supporters what that plan is. And the board also needs to consider its own role in this.<br /><br />Is the manager solely accountable? How much has the board’s line on wages and transfers contributed to player unrest and disaffection? How much did it contribute to the situation we now find ourselves in? And will it change to help support a new manager? We’d like to put on record our thanks to <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, Jesus Perez, Toni Jiminez and Miguel D’Agostino for the fantastic football and magical moments they have brought us over the last five years</p>

I think we were convinced and I was convinced that the final was going to go our way. That was completely in our minds. But no one is prepared after 30 seconds of the Champions League final to concede like that<br /><br />The goal changed the whole game, all the emotions.

A different project was going to be difficult to maintain - to keep improving<br /><br />I said to Daniel that we finished in the way that no one wanted but the end, because of our commitment, our emotion and our feeling - in football - it needed to happe.

That is the structure that keeps alive all the companies that provide the entertainment that is football. The other is the ideas of the clubs. Every single club and company have different cultures, different philosophies, different ways of working. They all have different plans for success. To be successful at one club you need to win the Champions League or <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, but for others it is to finish in the top four or six. For <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it was to build a new stadium and at the same time create a team to compete and cut the gap to the top four. Every single club has different aims and you as a coaching staff need to stick to these ideas. In the end, when we are waiting for a new offer, and we are capable of providing what a club expects from us, we are going to be very happy.<br /><br />The problem is which clubs are top six?. The top six always changes. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is not in the top six, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is not in the top six. You need to respect all the clubs. All the clubs are working so hard and investing money. Every season clubs have ambition to be top six or top four. I don’t think you can underestimate any club<br /><br />We are going to live a completely different era in football that we need to discover. How are these clubs or companies, because that’s what they are, going to be after this virus hopefully disappears? It’s a big question mark. That’s why it’s so difficult to know what project is going to be the right project. We are a coaching staff that are very receptive to listen to all the projects, all the people. We can learn from every single conversation and maybe we can see a motivation to go with them.</p>

We arrived at a club with a president like Nicola Cortese who gave us what we needed to create something unique in English football. Our ability to adapt to a completely different environment was incredible. We found a group of players who wanted to learn from the experiences we brought from Spanish football, and with the quality to play a different style of football to that which everyone in English football was used to. Young players started to appear, and people started to trust in young players, also in the English national team.<br /><br />At Espanyol, we were the first coaching staff who started to teach exercises to bring the ball out from the back. The facts are there. Just watch any game from around 2010 and 2011, the ball is played out from the goal. When previously it was always hit long. We started with that, and many people are a bit surprised. Everyone talks of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Madrid, Milan.
