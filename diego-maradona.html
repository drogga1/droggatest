In 1982 they came to Madrid to negotiate the signing of El Pelusa for Barca and they stayed in a house I had in Sor Angela de la Cruz, very close to the Santiago Bernabeu. But there were moments of doubt because Real Madrid got in the middle of it and the matter was about which club offered more money. The first option was to sign for Barca, but Czysterpiller was negotiating with both clubs. With Real Madrid, in secret, because I think nobody knew that. What’s more, the stadium was 500 metres from my house!<br /><br />Czysterpiller ended up buying my flat.

However, the Italian club were only offering one more year at that point and the player was furious]</b> As the World Cup finals will be held in Italy <b>[in 1990]</b> and Argentina will play in the Neapolitan city, I have the impression that the president of my club, Corrado Ferlaino, wants to put me to the test. If my performance were to be good, I would continue in his team. On the contrary, he would hand me my notice. But, as is logical, I do not accept that, at this stage of my career, I am questioned in terms of one specific result.
