The playmaker has made 21 appearances this term, scoring four goals and recording six assists, and his new deal commits him to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> club until he is 32.<br /><br />It comes on the day <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> broke their transfer record to sign striker <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and follows the departure of forward <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a>, who joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after lengthy contract negotiations with the Gunners<br /><br /><a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> has won three FA Cups in his three-and-a-half-year spell at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> - and no other player has recorded more assists or created more chances in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> since his debut in September 2013<br /><br /><a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> set a new <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> record in November 2015 by becoming the first player to create a goal in six consecutive matches.<br /><br />He scored nine goals and made 20 assists in the 2015-16 season and was named <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s player of the season<br /><br />However, some of his Gunners performances have been criticised and in February 2017 his agent said he was being made a ‘scapegoat’ for the north London club’s problems<br /><br />In 2017, <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup for the third time as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> beat <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at Wembley</p>
