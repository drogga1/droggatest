  <p><b>[Paul and Florentin Pogba’s mother, Yeo Moriba, speaks after her her sons’ teams, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and Saint-Etienne, drew each other in the last 32 of the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Europa League]</b> Me, I want two draws between my children. I do not want either to lose. But I know that unfortunately one of them will be eliminated. I will see both matches on 16 February in Manchester and 22 February in Saint-Etienne. My sons are very happy to meet on the field, they promised to exchange their jerseys</p>

  <p>I was born in Guinea and grew up there. I played a lot of different sports. But eventually, I chose football. We created a football team. And I was the captain of our women’s team. Maybe this was genetically passed to my children, I don’t know. But my three children have the same passion for football</p>

  <p><b>[Yeo Moriba, mother of the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> brothers, features in the latest episode of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Digital’s Sheroes series]</b> The three of them were always together, until they got separated. Paul went to Le Havre and the twins went to Spain. One weekend I would go and visit Paul, and the next weekend I’d visit the twins. Every time I left them I would give them this advice: ‘You left your country to reach a goal, so do your best to reach this goal’</p>
