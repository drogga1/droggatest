  <p><b>[Jan Molby confident Reds can finish the job against Man City]</b> They’re bound to be. That’s the way of football fans, you have optimism and pessimism - usually both at the same time! From the first whistle, City will have to take risks. And what we’ve seen this season is that Liverpool are very good at taking advantage of those kind of situations. If I’m a Liverpool player, I’m thinking we will have opportunities on Tuesday night. City will at times have to play with three or even two at the back, they just have to go for it. And that should play into Liverpool’s hands<br /><br />What happened to City at Anfield is that they were put under pressure, first by the way Liverpool played and then by the scoreline. That made them nervous, no doubt, and they were unable to play like themselves. Liverpool haven’t had that feeling in the tie, and they won’t get it until City score. Until City score, Liverpool will be absolutely fine. But if and when City do score, that is when you need to remain calm and remain in control. That’s what City failed to do at Anfield, and again on Saturday against Manchester United too. Against United they were in control, in control, in control and then boom, Pogba scores and everything changes<br /><br />It would be too dangerous to sit back. There are certain teams you can do that against, but certain teams you can’t. I know that Liverpool did it for 45 minutes in the first leg, but another 90 away from home? I don’t think Liverpool could handle that<br /><br />You still have respected pundits who tell me Liverpool can’t defend. Compared to who? City? Can they defend? If Liverpool concede that goal Chris Smalling scored on Saturday, you’d know about it, believe me! Since Van Dijk has come in, there has been a change in Liverpool’s defending. It’s not all down to him, but his influence is clear. He has made them more comfortable, more proactive and solid. They don’t look vulnerable at set-pieces any more, they don’t look susceptible to pace. They look comfortable, organised. I hope I’m still saying that at 10 o’clock on Tuesday, mind!<br /><br />Guardiola got it wrong at Anfield. He changed the way they’ve played all season. Their strength is the width, where they stretch you so you can’t cope. He took part of that away by not playing Sterling. It made <b>[Leroy]</b> Sane very predictable, and City didn’t have that same variation. I think he will go back to what he knows for this one. You need Sane, Sterling, <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne and <b>[David]</b> Silva in the team, for sure. So then it comes down to who plays up front? I’d be surprised if he went with two strikers. From a Liverpool perspective, if they see <b>[Gabriel]</b> Jesus on the teamsheet it gives them a boost. They coped with him at Anfield quite well. But if they see Aguero, one of the greatest strikers in the world, it’s a different feeling. Teamsheets are important. The first thing you do when you get the opposition team is you look for standout players, are they playing? If they saw Aguero on the bench, or Sterling, it’d give Liverpool a lift for sure<br /><br />Salah is crucial. With him, you almost feel he’s guaranteed one goal a game and he’s become an out-ball as well, he keeps defences honest. We saw that for the first goal in the first leg. His form is so good that you can’t stop him. You look at City, and where is their big weak link? It’s at left-back, yeah? So if Salah is there, you’re already in business. And if Salah isn’t there, then the left-back, whether it’s Danilo or <b>[Fabian]</b> Delph or <b>[Aymeric]</b> Laporte gets a lift. They’d love to see him off that teamsheet<br /><br />How good does that sound? Look, you can’t keep telling people how great you used to be. At some stage you have to join the party again. If you talk about the likes of Real, Barca and Bayern, then you’re very much dining at the top table. It doesn’t get any better than that in European football<br /><br />Of course I do. They’re winning 3-0! I tell you what, ask City if they want to swap places eh? I know what Pep would say to that one!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool look set to land Nabil Fekir before the World Cup starts]</b> There’ll be more business to come, and Nabil Fekir is clearly a player they want and will hope to tie up a deal before the World Cup. Fekir is very much in line with the attacking players we have at the club, at being able to handle the ball at a high tempo and play at a high tempo, being cute and with a sharp mind. We do need an option for the front three, and he would be an interesting purchase. I would be amazed if there are not other big clubs interested, but Liverpool are slowly making their way back not only to the top of the English game, but the top of the European game. There will be more and more of those top players keen on joining them.<br /><br />Liverpool’s signing of Fabinho was proper old school. Nobody saw it coming. And he will be a really good addition to the Reds squad. Fabinho has nearly everything you need in a modern midfield player, being mobile, young and a good reader of the game. I was really impressed with him when whenever I watched Monaco during their season when they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2016-17. I thought he was a million miles ahead of his midfield partner Tiemoue Bakayoko, who is at Chelsea now. Fabinho is a typical Jurgen Klopp player. He is always where you want your midfield player to be, and is never out of position. He doesn’t do things for the sake of doing them, he keeps it simple, he is mobile, he doesn’t commit an awful lot of fouls</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is getting back to his best]</b> Just as some people have seemingly decreed that the team is not as dynamic as last season, similar remarks have been said about Mohamed Salah although his goal in the 2-0 win over Fulham suggested he’s getting back to his best. A lot of observations on Salah are based on his stats and it is very difficult for him to match his numbers from last season. But I think if you look at the highlights from Liverpool’s games so far this season he will feature in most of them and they’ll be him creating chancing or scoring goals. In that respect he’s almost as effective as he was last season but the problem is that he obviously finished the campaign with such a flourish, scoring some very magnificent goals, so that’s maybe why some people are saying he’s not quite at the same levels. I still think that he’s involved in an awful lot of things that matter so I believe he’s actually very close to being where he wants to be.<br /><br />Xherdan Shaqiri of course was the other goalscorer <b>[against Fulham]</b> and the Liverpool fans have now got a pretty good feel as to what he is about. That involves an awful lot of quality. That was demonstrated with his goal which wasn’t an easy volley but he controlled it very well. There were doubts about Shaqiri when he came in and some asked the question as to whether he’d get the team ethic for working hard but he’s fitted in perfectly and I think he realises this is his last chance at a big club</p>

  <p><b>[How Liverpool’s £75m man Van Dijk silenced the doubters]</b> He’s similar. In that you always feel that whatever happens he will help you out. He looks after people. There’s nothing better as a footballer than knowing someone has your back.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourninho has been warned that Manchester United are not capable of doing the defensive jobs they have done on Liverpool in the past]</b> I don’t know if Manchester United are capable of doing the defensive jobs they have done on Liverpool in the past. The longer it goes without them producing those heroic performances, the more I doubt they are capable. I know they got a couple of draws with Arsenal and Chelsea, but Liverpool are another level. I’m not convinced that Mourinho can produce a tactical masterclass to get himself a result. I think Liverpool will have too much for them. They are too inconsistent. The defeat in Valencia, I know it was a fringe team, won’t do them any good. I’d be amazed if we didn’t have too much quality for them. The level of quality you expect from Manchester United is not there. They have some average players and some good players who aren’t performing at the level expected of them. I think what Mourinho wants to do is go with a defensive tactic and hope that the bit of pace he has causes problems. But you need good enough defenders to invite Liverpool onto you, and I’m not convinced. But you are playing Manchester United. That’s why you can never be sure, because we know ourselves that big clubs can find results that nobody else can.</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Molby says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> will be remembered as a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> great]</b> It’s often overlooked how important these people are. But at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club we’re very proud of our history and if you go through all of the great teams, we can all name the great players - but <b>[also]</b> the ones who were there every week, produced every week that, through history, become great players. Once Jordan is gone, people will look at the void that he leaves and think, ‘Oh wow’.<br /><br /><b>[Molby added on <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>’s character]</b> It’s much more important now than it ever was. We never thought about the importance of characters in the dressing room because we felt we had nothing but characters. He’s never been scared of sort of confronting the criticism he’s had - by that I mean, you go out and play your game. Some people try and change their play, other people buckle under that constant, ‘Can we get somebody better?’. That’s why when I didn’t play, I never knocked on the manager’s door. Because when you’re playing, you know why you’re playing. And when you’re not playing, you know why you’re not playing. The biggest compliment you can have as a player is if the manager keeps on picking you</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Molby says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s class of 2019-20 one of the best teams ever]</b> This team will go down in history not just as a great <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team, but in the big scheme of things as one of the best football teams we have ever seen. I have no doubt that. This is a side with no weaknesses. You get nothing cheap against this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. There are no defensive errors. There are no cheap goals conceded from set-pieces. Everything you get you have to earn. So, it does now seem like a case of you’re beaten before the first whistle blows<br /><br />You know that to get a result against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> you have to be at your absolute best mentally and physically. You have to produce at a level you very rarely can reach. I wouldn’t call it mission impossible, but if someone had said two years ago this is where we are heading you’d have thought ‘Wow’. And we are there now<br /><br />At the start of a season, rightly or wrongly, we were always favourites. But then trying to guess who would finish second, that could be very difficult. But for the past couple of years, and probably for another two or three to come, it will be between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City are at their best they are both very effective in the way they play — and they are equally brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Molby says Thirty years without a title? We didn’t see what was coming]</b> I thought <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were an absolute certainty this season. But then, I thought they’d win it last season too! It’s been coming, hasn’t it?. It hasn’t happened overnight; this has been four years in the making. Ever since Jurgen came to the club, it’s been building towards this<br /><br />As a club, we didn’t see what was coming. Yes, you could look at the squad which won the league in 1990 and say it needed a couple of additions, but 30 years with no title?! Nobody thought that<br /><br />Each year, layers were being taken off. We were losing games we had to win, and that hadn’t happened for a long time<br /><br /><b>[Off the pitch, of course, the club was coming to terms with the enormity of the Hillsborough disaster]</b> It did, but as players we honestly never discussed it. Even when we lost to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in ‘89 <b>[just six weeks later]</b>, it was never talked about as a reason. It’s only later when people started to wonder what kind of impact it had<br /><br />History told us that if we didn’t win the league, we’d win it the next year. We didn’t think it was over for us when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won the league <b>[in ‘91]</b>. But when recruitment isn’t quite what it used to be, it goes on a bit longer and you start thinking ‘Hang on, we need a rebuild here.’ And when was the last time <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the great <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, had needed a rebuild?<br /><br />It had been an incredible strength of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, getting big decisions right. They would move players on five minutes before their time was up. I don’t think there was anything wrong with Souness’ thinking. To keep the fire burning, he felt he needed to do something. But he ended up doing it in a manner which he looks back on now and knows was wrong. The biggest thing wasn’t the players he let go, it was the players he bought. It was the players we got that killed us in the end.<br /><br />From one day to the next almost, you could see the decline. At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> we had a very simple way of training, but it was always done to a level. All of a sudden, you look around and think ‘How can we play the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> want to play on a Saturday, if this is the level we are producing in training?’ Everything changed. We bought a left-back called Julian Dicks. A left-back who served balls into the front man. We never played like that. We played through the middle and we created overloads. We never played with two strikers, we played with one up front and one off the front - Kenny or <a href="peter-beardsley.html">Beardsley</a> - but all those things changed overnight<br /><br />Football was changing, and as a football club we were probably always a little slow to follow suit. We were still holding onto what had been successful in the 70s and 80s, while football around us was accelerating into a new era. Once that train left, we weren’t on it. And it took forever for us to catch up<br /><br />Sometimes, the first step a club takes when they start to think things are going awry is to spend money. We just didn’t spend it very well<br /><br />The quicker you realise you have problems, the more chance you have of putting them right. To start off with, though, I don’t think we realised we had a problem. We thought it was a blip, that we’d spend, and things would click into place. Roy Evans was a good appointment at the time, but I never thought that team in the mid-90s would win the title. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> realised they had to do something different, they realised where they were at, and that was when <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Houllier</a> came in<br /><br />It’s amazing to think back to that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> game in 2017, when we lost 4-1. And what happens? We build a team and they build a stadium. And that’s kind of modern football. It’s about the decisions you make as a club. We can’t get NFL games at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, but we have a team that’s winning trophies<br /><br />Five years ago, there was a list of great players who you’d say would never, ever come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. That was a given. Now? Who is off limits, really? Not many. And compare us to somebody like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - we don’t have to pay a premium for our players anymore, whereas they do. They can’t offer what we do. They have to pay 20 per cent on top, like we did in the 1990s and 2000s</p>
