  <p><b>[Oliver Dowden states British sporting events are to continue as normal]</b> At this stage, we’re not in the territory of cancelling or postponing events. I was at Twickenham <b>[for England vs Wales]</b> with the Prime Minister <b>[on Saturday]</b>. There was a huge crowd of people there. There is no reason why people should not be going to those events. It is very premature to be talking about things like that</p>

  <p><b>[Can footballers be furloughed and are they still getting paid?]</b> This scheme is designed for struggling businesses to make sure, if they are faced with the position where they have to make staff redundant, rather than making them redundant they furlough them on 80% of their wages so they can bring them back when business picks up. So football clubs should only be using it as a last resort, I think the fans and the public at large are going to take a pretty dim view if they’re not using it except in the last resort</p>

  <p><b>[Dowden believes that there is scope for competitive action to being around the middle of June]</b> I had some constructive discussions on Thursday with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>, the EFL and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We’re working hard with them to try to get it back. I am aiming for mid-June but the number one test is public safety. If we can do this in a safe way. They like other sports are looking at returning behind closed doors. We’ve met several times with Public Health England to look at the safety of that. If we can sort that out, we’ll look to resume by mid-June. We’re making good progress. I’m hoping we can have something a bit more ambitious, with free-to-air matches so people can watch from home. That would be helpful, in terms discouraging people from leaving their homes in order to watch it, which clearly we don’t want to happen, and also about how about how we support the wider support of football. What we’re aiming for - but we’re not quite there in terms of all the arrangements - is to finish the season behind closed doors from about mid-June onwards</p>

  <p><b>[UK sports minister welcomes planned return of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> after coronavirus hiatus]</b> Positive to see further steps on the return of football today. I’ve been pushing for as many games as possible to be free to view &amp; for the return of the top league to support the whole football family. We are still working on govt guidance before we green light sports’ return.</p>
