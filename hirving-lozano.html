  <p><b>[Mexico hero Lozano revels in ‘best goal of my life’ after Germany giant-killing]</b> We are very happy. My teammates and I did some great work, we all ran our hearts out and this is the result of all this hard work. I don’t know if it is the biggest victory in <b>[Mexican]</b> history but one of the biggest for sure. It is great to start on the right foot when you are playing against the world champions. I would have to agree it is the best goal I have scored in my life. We all dream of playing in the World Cup.<br /><br />We had drawn up a plan six months back but due to injuries we had to change some of our players. But we always thought of having two quick players on the wings and an offensive midfielder in Miguel Layun. In the first half we played with intelligence defensively and caught them on the counter. We could have scored earlier. In the first half we were the better side, in the second we knew that Germany have an outstanding team and they tried to attack more. We prepared for their use of Mario Gomez. Yesterday we practiced defending with four midfielders and three players up front and that’s how we almost got the second goal today. Mexico has a bright future, with Jesus Gallardo who is 23 and Hirving Lozano even younger. We will celebrate responsibility. I’d like to dedicate this win to all the Mexican fans that made the journey out here and to everyone that supports us</p>

I think that’s why he came here. I think he’s had some minutes, but little by little he’ll have more.

Naples is not only an intermediate step for him, it’s also a big milestone and I am convinced that it will be a fundamental step for his career. It was a very long operation that started four months ago. It took four months to close it but I can say that in recent months playing in Naples has always been his goal. There has been interest from other clubs, but none of them ever actually progressed <b>[past initital talks]</b>. Only Naples did. I know that Naples is very similar to Latin America, with a much more intense passion than in Holland. I saw the images of his arrival and I really liked the welcome he received, the pressures do not scare him</p>

They’ve always been with me and it’s wonderful that I can share this experience with them here<br /><br /><b>[Lozano wore the No.11 shirt during his time with <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>]</b> I’ve chosen the No.11 shirt because I like the number and it’s always brought me good luck. I think I can add something to the team. I’ll work hard so that I can be useful in any position. I spoke to president <b>[Aurelio]</b> <a href="aurelio-de-laurentiis.html">De Laurentiis</a> several times and he was always really positive about the team. It was a pleasure to speak with him. I promise the fans that I’ll give 100% in every game. I hope that’s enough for us to achieve our goals. I learned a lot in Holland. I’ll try and use the experience I have to help the team</p>

He welcomed me to Italy. It was something very nice, he is a spectacular player, out of this world. It was something very nice. I really enjoyed the game because the team played very well and also for playing against great players, not only Cristiano<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he has any special rituals on debut day]</b> I didn’t do anything in particular. I always have the desire to play. I hadn’t talked to the coach but it was very nice that he made me enter the second half in a spectacular stadium. I know I have little time <b>[to adjust]</b>, but I hope to succeed thanks to God and the confidence of the coach. My goal is to work and learn both from my team-mates and from the coach</p>

After that, in the tactical chat, he told me I was going to start, which was a great thing. I was a bit tired from the trip, but I felt really good. The only thing he asked me is to play, to do what he asks and above all do what I know how to do</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a> benches Hirving Lozano is probably toughest challenge yet for him]</b> Doing what you love sometimes implies putting forth an effort that few know, that those who enjoy a game couldn’t even imagine. Today I found in your words almost the exact reflection of the cost of following my dream. They surprised me. In them I found the answer to a lot of questions that have been turning over in my head. Your words put me over the top. They gave me strength. I’ll have them with me whenever they might be needed<br /><br />You don’t know how much I wish for your predictions to become reality. I’ll keep working with the desire to achieve them. I thank you for having dedicated your video to me. Today has been a good day after having read them, a calmer day and one with the joy of knowing that someone might understand my current situation. From the heart, thank you very much</p>
