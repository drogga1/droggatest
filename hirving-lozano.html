  <p><b>[The father of Hirving Lozano says his son is thrilled to follow in the footsteps of Diego Maradona by lining up for Napoli]</b> Yes, I heard it yesterday and obviously I am very happy. Imagine, my son will play in the team that Maradona played for. He told me that this is particularly exciting for him. I am here in Mexico with his brother Bryan, who is also a professional footballer in the Mexican Serie A, but as soon as possible we will come to Naples to visit him<br /><br /><b>[Maradona was in the last Napoli side to win the Serie A title almost 30 years ago]</b> We know that the goal is to win <b>[Serie A]</b>. Hirving arrived well aware of the fact that this is his goal as a Napoli player. It will not be easy against Juventus, but I am sure that the arrival of my son will be a good addition towards achieving this great goal<br /><br />I am more than happy, I am in seventh heaven. It is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a father to see his son reach the top, realising his dreams step by step. Naples is not only an intermediate step for him, it’s also a big milestone and I am convinced that it will be a fundamental step for his career. It was a very long operation that started four months ago. It took four months to close it but I can say that in recent months playing in Naples has always been his goal. There has been interest from other clubs, but none of them ever actually progressed <b>[past initital talks]</b>. Only Naples did. I know that Naples is very similar to Latin America, with a much more intense passion than in Holland. I saw the images of his arrival and I really liked the welcome he received, the pressures do not scare him</p>

  <p><b>[Hirving Lozano has revealed that <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> were always his first choice after he was unveiled as the Italian club’s latest new signing on Tuesday]</b> <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> was always my first choice. I’m pleased it all worked out. I’m really happy to be part of this group. We have a great team with top players. I know the team well. I’m here to improve and perform well. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> have always competed at the top and this year we want to give everything we have to achieve our goals.<br /><br />I’m a technical player and I’m fast. The coach will decide where to play me. I’ll always give my all. I want to give my all for the team and the coach. I still have a lot to learn. I want to work hard and develop here. I know <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. The advice of <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> will be key if I’m to do well. My team-mates have been very welcoming. I just need to work hard and give my all for the team. My family is very important to me. They’ve always been with me and it’s wonderful that I can share this experience with them here<br /><br /><b>[Lozano wore the No.11 shirt during his time with PSV]</b> I’ve chosen the No.11 shirt because I like the number and it’s always brought me good luck. I think I can add something to the team. I’ll work hard so that I can be useful in any position. I spoke to president <b>[Aurelio]</b> <a href="aurelio-de-laurentiis.html">De Laurentiis</a> several times and he was always really positive about the team. It was a pleasure to speak with him. I promise the fans that I’ll give 100% in every game. I hope that’s enough for us to achieve our goals. I learned a lot in Holland. I’ll try and use the experience I have to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Hirving Lozano has revealed the on-field message he received from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> during a goalscoring debut for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> against Juventus]</b> After their last goal, he approached me and congratulated me. He welcomed me to Italy. It was something very nice, he is a spectacular player, out of this world. It was something very nice. I really enjoyed the game because the team played very well and also for playing against great players, not only Cristiano<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he has any special rituals on debut day]</b> I didn’t do anything in particular. I always have the desire to play. I hadn’t talked to the coach but it was very nice that he made me enter the second half in a spectacular stadium. I know I have little time <b>[to adjust]</b>, but I hope to succeed thanks to God and the confidence of the coach. My goal is to work and learn both from my team-mates and from the coach</p>

  <p><b>[While there are a pair of marquee matchups against reigning champion <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the first of which takes place Tuesday at the Stadio San Paolo, ties against Genk and Red Bull Salzburg look like opportunities for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> to pick up points and move into the knockout stages]</b> It’s a really difficult game, it’s a great club with great players. They’re the current Champions League champion, so you have to live it to the fullest and do what the manager asks us to do in the best way possible<br /><br /><b>[Lozano is yet to get a full 90 minutes with Napoli]</b> When I got here, I arrived Thursday early in the morning and the only thing (Ancelotti) asked me is how I was feeling. After that, in the tactical chat, he told me I was going to start, which was a great thing. I was a bit tired from the trip, but I felt really good. The only thing he asked me is to play, to do what he asks and above all do what I know how to do</p>

  <p><b>[Gattuso benches Hirving Lozano is probably toughest challenge yet for him]</b> Doing what you love sometimes implies putting forth an effort that few know, that those who enjoy a game couldn’t even imagine. Today I found in your words almost the exact reflection of the cost of following my dream. They surprised me. In them I found the answer to a lot of questions that have been turning over in my head. Your words put me over the top. They gave me strength. I’ll have them with me whenever they might be needed<br /><br />You don’t know how much I wish for your predictions to become reality. I’ll keep working with the desire to achieve them. I thank you for having dedicated your video to me. Today has been a good day after having read them, a calmer day and one with the joy of knowing that someone might understand my current situation. From the heart, thank you very much</p>
