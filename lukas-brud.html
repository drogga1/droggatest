  <p><b>[IFAB confirms <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referees using VAR incorrectly]</b> Clear and obvious still remains - it’s an important principle. There should not be a lot of time spent to find something marginal. If something is not clear on the first sight, then it’s not obvious and it shouldn’t be considered. Looking at one camera angle is one thing but looking at 15, trying to find something that was potentially not even there, this was not the idea of the VAR principle. It should be clear and obvious</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger believes a player should be ruled onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is behind or level with the relevant defender]</b> We have a very strict procedure that we introduced a few years ago that any proposal has to be submitted usually on or before November 1 of the previous year in order for us to be able to discuss a proposal in detail with the relevant bodies, such as our advisory panels – the football and the technical. The board of directors then takes a decision on which proposals go forward to the AGM for approval<br /><br />I’m not judging the proposal, it might be a good one, but this is not up for approval or for a vote as a concrete proposal to go into the laws of the game, it’s impossible. The meeting is also to discuss football and some ideas, and the AGM could say OK, this might be something we want to discuss further, or give it to the <b>[advisory]</b> panels to get their point of view and maybe do some trialling. But it won’t be used at the Euros as reported by some media. Nothing can be used without being in the laws of the game, and it definitely will not be in the laws of the game next season. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> is a highly knowledgeable and experienced football expert, so we certainly welcome his ideas, but we haven’t discussed it yet and we simply cannot approve anything that was not discussed on any level so far<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> has reportedly asked to consider a 10cm margin of error to offside decisions, something Brud doubts is a viable solution]</b> It’s something we will be discussing, but not as a concrete proposal to go forward on the agenda. We need to find a solution for the lack of acceptance for taking decisions that are very accurate, even if they seem to be too forensic. But margin of error suggests you give a specific distance – what if it’s 11cm instead of 10cm?<br /><br />We need to go away from margin of error, we need to find an instruction or an understanding of how to apply the offside law with VAR. If the evidence is unclear, and you can usually quickly see if something is clearly offside or not, then the original decision stands.<br /><br />We generally do not see this being a global issue in other countries so it’s very difficult to constantly react on the offside issue. If the video footage clearly shows that the player was in an offside position, and the referee has not given offside, the decision should change. But you need the lines for a very simple reason. The cameras are not static, the picture that you are taking is not always in line with the angle of the offside. We know from goal-line technology that when the ball is on the line <b>[in the air]</b> it looks like the ball has crossed the line. When you look at it from above, the ball is still on the line. We have the same problem here.<br /><br />They <b>[VARs]</b> use tools to manually lay a line that is calibrated that is actually showing the truth, and not video footage alone. With video footage alone you cannot take the decision. The tool is helping the referee to make accurate decisions. This for me is the reference point, this for me is the final decision, full stop. With margin of error, where does it start and where does it end? The levels of calibration and levels of accuracy have vastly improved from where it was a few years ago. We need to look into this, and we are constantly looking into this. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like we’re ignoring what <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> is saying, but there are various things that play a role in this debate</p>
