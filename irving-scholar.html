<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sir Alex Ferguson agreed to become Tottenham manager two years before taking over at Manchester United]</b> The truth was that I had been talking to and negotiating with Alex Ferguson about a deal. He and I had had very long and detailed discussions. I told him that I was a very old-fashioned type of chap and that the most important thing was that once you agree something, once you shake someone’s hand, it’s in concrete. Once you do that, then you do not - under any circumstances whatsoever - you do not go back on it. It’s over. I told him that, when I first met him. So we had this big thing about the handshake.<br /><br />We went on and on and on, discussions, negotiations, down to the minutiae of the contract. Everything was agreed. So I said ‘Can we meet?’. He agreed and I said I’d like him to meet someone else on the board, Paul Bobroff. We arranged to meet in Paris on a Sunday morning, just by the airport. I said, ‘Are you sure you’re ready?’. He said, ‘I’m sure’. So we had this seminal moment of the handshake. As you know, unfortunately, he didn’t keep to it. He never told me why. I had my own theories but it doesn’t matter anymore. It was a disappointment. He stayed at Aberdeen for another two years</p>
