<blockquote>
  <p>[Ben Thornley says <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> is not the right fit for Ole Gunnar’s Solskjaer’s vision at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>] It may not be a <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> team that he would thrive playing in, but with that being said, he does offer something different with his presence up front, so if he stayed it still wouldn’t be an issue. I just feel that Ole Gunnar is moving to a slightly more dynamic and fast forward line<br /><br />[A man who emerged into the United first team fold alongside the likes of <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> added on <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>] I think he proved in his first season that he can score goals. I think he scored 27 goals that season. There’s no question that he’s got that ability. At Man United, when you’re challenging for honours, you need to have a striker that’s going to be scoring you 25, 27 goals a season and he was the last United player to do that. I just think that for whatever reason it didn’t happen for him last season. He just hasn’t hit the heights after that season. I’m not too sure that with the way that Ole Gunnar wants to play, and certainly the way that he’s indicated that he might play from the pre-season games so far, <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s stature probably doesn’t fit the style of play that <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> wants. I mean, he’s got nimble players up there, he’s got fast players there that are quick off the mark that look like they are going to try and win the ball back up the park if people give them an opportunity to do</p>
