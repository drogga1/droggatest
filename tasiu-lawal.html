<blockquote>
  <p>[Katsina United’s Tasiu Lawal has described their 1-2 away loss to Sunshine Stars at the Ondo State Sports Complex, Akure in a topflight tie as underwhelming] It was an unfortunate loss to be frank because we have no business losing the match at all. We played our hearts out and deserve at least a point. We came into the tie full of optimism that we can get something out of the encounter having lost two points at home against Kano Pillars.<br /><br />It is always an amazing feeling to score and scoring my first goal of the season is even more special to me. But the fact that we lost the game has taken the shine off the goal I scored. I was shattered when they got the spot kick and converted it. What we need to do now however is to concentrate on the weekend game against Enyimba. We must forget about this defeat immediately and think of what we must do to beat them</p>
