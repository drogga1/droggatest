  <dd>Ever since they became global icons, footballers have always been the target of criminals and terrorists. In 1963, one of the finest players ever to lace up his boots, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s Alfredo Di Stefano, was kidnapped in order to attract publicity for the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) campaign against government corruption in Venezuela. After 56 hours, on August 26, he was released unharmed.</dd>

  <p><b>[Alfredo Di Stefano on today’s football]</b> It has changed a bit, of course. The speed and all that. But let me tell you something: in the olden times, let’s say the year, I don’t know, in the Sixties for instance, we would eat a plate of spaghetti and run out onto the pitch. Then people started saying ‘they’re too full’, meaning you’d get bloated like a pig if you ate spaghetti. But this shows you those guys were clever because nowadays all the medical experts recommend pasta for athletes and footballers because you digest it slowly<br /><br />We must always strive to improve, little by little. The electric eye thing they want to use - it could save time. The other day I saw this goal and the keeper was complaining. I thought it had gone in but the linesman waved <b>[to indicate it had stayed]</b> out. So there’s a big fuss to consult the rule book<br /><br />Do you know how many rules there are in football? He knows because I told him. But nobody knows. There are 17 rules. That’s it. Everyone talks about football and nobody remembers this simple fact<br /><br /><b>[He knows because I told him. But nobody knows. There are 17 rules. That’s it. Everyone talks about football and nobody remembers this simple fact]</b> I always enjoyed training, sweating and learning. I still don’t know. I’ve always been a team player, that’s all. One for all and all for one<br /><br /><b>[When asked him to pick modern players he rates and he shrugs his shoulders in exasperation]</b> I have many friends! Maybe I forget one name and then they see this list and think: ‘This Di Stefano, the whore that gave birth to him … ‘. <b>[Then he grins]</b> You know, they’re always busting my balls with this - ‘pick a favourite, pick the best’ - that once I said ‘OK, here’s five names and then I’m saying no more: Muñoz, Moreno, Pedernera, Labruna and Lousta’<br /><br /><b>[He claims he learnt to play by simply watching the likes of Francisco Varallo, the legendary Boca striker]</b> There was no TV back then so living near the ground and watching them was the only way<br /><br /><b>[Even with regard to positions or styles of play, Di Stefano shuns labels, stating categorically that he has]</b> played everywhere, even in goal once. <b>[Amadeo]</b> Carrizo got injured and there were no changes so I had to get in there. It was against Boca, but I didn’t have to save because they never even got near our goal. We won 1-0<br /><br /><b>[He laughs, and carries on laughing when he observes]</b> He laughs, and carries on laughing when he observes<br /><br /><b>[But the quote he truly values, he says, is in a friend’s office]</b> He has a beautiful ball, with the inscription ‘So many intruders make their living out of you’<br /><br /><b>[Echoing his one time team-mate from River Plate, Jose Manuel Moreno, who once defined his playing motto as]</b> I always wanted to have the ball for myself; she was my girlfriend. Thanks, Old Girl</p>

  <p><b>[The kidnap of Di Stefano]</b> I was blindfolded when the gang took me from the hotel on Saturday and kept locked in a bedroom. <b>[…]</b> I thought they were going to kill me <b>[…]</b> My position was uncomfortable. I am not a politician so I’d prefer not to try to explain why they kidnapped me. All I know is that they never mistreated me. The commander of the rebel group, Maximo Canales, directed the kidnapping and was with me all the time. He apologised a thousand times for the inconvenience. I was worried because of the anguish it was causing my wife and my eight-year-old son. The day after the kidnapping they let me listen on the radio when my team beat Oporto of Portugal. They let me out of a car <b>[with sticking plasters over his eyes]</b> on the Avenida Libertador this afternoon. I took a cab to the Spanish Embassy</p>

  <p><b>[Football legend Alfredo Di Stefano says he may have played against <a href="pope-francis.html">Pope Francis</a> as children]</b> <a href="pope-francis.html">Pope Francis</a> and I went to the same school in Buenos Aires. He lived in a church two blocks from my family’s house, where my sister Norma still resides. In our neighbourhood we used to hold major football sessions that went on until it got dark, with everyone playing against each other. Maybe the pope was one of the guys I played football with in the street<br /><br />At that time I was the famous one because from a very young age I belonged to River Plate’s youth team, everybody knew me<br /><br /><b>[Di Stefano is an honorary president of Madrid, and his interest in football meant he missed the moment when his compatriot emerged as the new pope]</b> I must confess that while everyone else watched the white smoke live, I saw it later. I was, as always, watching a football game</p>

  <p><b>[Antiquated Mourinho finished at the highest level]</b> Barcelona play football and dance, while Madrid just run back and forth constantly, tiring themselves out. Barcelona were a lion, Madrid a mouse. Barca treat the ball with adoration and respect, almost nurturing it. To see this team in action is a delight. You don’t just watch their football with your eyes but you feel it inside.</p>
