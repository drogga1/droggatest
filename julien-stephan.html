  <p><b>[Club president Olivier Letang said it was ‘a very great pleasure’ to confirm the coach would be staying on]</b> It’s a great point of pride to pursue my mission with the first team. This season has been historic and rich in emotions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Julien Stephan says Camavinga can play for Real Madrid]</b> Yes, he does. In the medium term, I see him in a structure of the highest level with demands of the highest level. Following his progression, he has the potential and all the qualities required to settle in a top club one day<br /><br />I always give him the advice to stay one more season at Rennes because it is his training club. After a good season, that quality leap must always be confirmed and it would be easier for him to do it here. I think he has one or two stages left before making the jump for a big one. There is a difference between being able to play a high-level season at your training club and being able to play about 60 games per campaign at a giant club every three days. It already makes a big difference, but he has a couple of steps to take to establish himself in a top club</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rennes manager Julien Stephan remains hopeful they can keep Camavinga for at least another season]</b> It would be beneficial for him to stay at least one more year in Rennes, because he is in a place he knows him well, he is at a club which trusts him enormously and because he is also supervised by people who know him perfectly</p>
