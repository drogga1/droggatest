  <p><b>[Rennes coach Julien Stephan and Emery were questioned on Ben Arfa earlier this week]</b> Hatem has a lot of experience, he’ll be able to handle it in a very smart way. We did not need to talk about it together and there are plenty of other topics to talk about before talking about that. It is Rennes against Arsenal in the Europa League, it is not Hatem against Emery. Champions are always present in this type of match and I’m sure Hatem will have a big game</p>

  <p><b>[Club president Olivier Letang said it was ‘a very great pleasure’ to confirm the coach would be staying on]</b> It’s a great point of pride to pursue my mission with the first team. This season has been historic and rich in emotions</p>

  <p><b>[Julien Stephan says Camavinga can play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> Yes, he does. In the medium term, I see him in a structure of the highest level with demands of the highest level. Following his progression, he has the potential and all the qualities required to settle in a top club one day<br /><br />I always give him the advice to stay one more season at Rennes because it is his training club. After a good season, that quality leap must always be confirmed and it would be easier for him to do it here. I think he has one or two stages left before making the jump for a big one. There is a difference between being able to play a high-level season at your training club and being able to play about 60 games per campaign at a giant club every three days. It already makes a big difference, but he has a couple of steps to take to establish himself in a top club</p>

  <p><b>[Rennes manager Julien Stephan remains hopeful they can keep Camavinga for at least another season]</b> It would be beneficial for him to stay at least one more year in Rennes, because he is in a place he knows him well, he is at a club which trusts him enormously and because he is also supervised by people who know him perfectly</p>
