  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s title-winning side ‘one of best in their history’]</b> One of the big things <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> did was after the European Cup win after the end of last season, he didn’t make too much of it. There wasn’t a huge focus on it. He didn’t plaster <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> in European Cup paraphernalia, it was just another trophy, and it sent a message to his players that that’s down, now the focus is on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Not wanting to look back, there’s been too much of that in the past, they’ve got to look forward<br /><br />Every single person, players most obviously but all the staff up to the owners have bought into that mindset and really moved forward. During the lockdown there was an interesting quote from <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a>, trying to explore what makes a serial winner, and he said <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> told me that winning was important, but <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> told me that winning is normal. I think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is doing that at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> too<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> on their tails next season]</b> I think it will be very difficult for a team to go and win multiple title. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s were the first to win back-to-back titles for a decade, and you only have to look at the history of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to see how things can change. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> finished 25 points behind <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> two seasons ago, who everyone thought no one would catch. City are now 23 behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I’m certain that’s a message <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will be projecting to his players, that we’re just scratching the surface here, if you want to achieve more you’re going to have to go again, rise to the challenge and accept there’ll be teams like City, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and United who have been hurt and want to put that right</p>
