<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Hoever signs new long-term <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deal]</b> I’m really happy to have signed here. I need to be realistic. I hope to make some minutes in the first team this year, of course, but I know that I will probably play more games for the U23s. I will just train hard with the first team, show them what I can do and if there is a chance, I will be ready. That’s what I am hoping for. I still need to learn a lot of things. I am still 17, so I just need to keep doing what I am doing to get better at the things that can be better. It’s a lot of trust from the club to let me sign this new contract. I will try to do them proud and show what I can do for this club - and I hope these are not the last few years I play here.</p>
