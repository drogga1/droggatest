  <p><b>[Liverpool youngster Ki-Jana Hoever has claimed his team-mate Virgil van Dijk is best defender in world football]</b> Virgil is the best defender in the world - and I can say that with 100 percent certainty. He is so good that the great thing about Liverpool now is that it is not just the strikers and attackers in our team who get all the praise. They used to always get the credit, but something has changed. People now understand and see the importance of great defending<br /><br />It isn’t just watching him play against the best forwards in the world that makes me admire him. When I play alongside him in training I see all the details, his hunger for perfection, the way he coaches me, his positioning and his little comments towards me. He seems to be right all the time. I wonder, at those moments, why I did not see that or why I was not in that position before. That, for me, is pure class<br /><br />I hope that in a couple of years I can play next to van Dijk in defence. You can’t wish for a better mentor and tutor as a professional player. There is a little detail in Virgil’s game - that I call the shoulder. He is always looking over his shoulder. He is always aware what is going on around him. He has his own game to concentrate on, but he is paying attention to everyone else too</p>

  <p><b>[Hoever signs new long-term <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deal]</b> I’m really happy to have signed here. I need to be realistic. I hope to make some minutes in the first team this year, of course, but I know that I will probably play more games for the U23s. I will just train hard with the first team, show them what I can do and if there is a chance, I will be ready. That’s what I am hoping for. I still need to learn a lot of things. I am still 17, so I just need to keep doing what I am doing to get better at the things that can be better. It’s a lot of trust from the club to let me sign this new contract. I will try to do them proud and show what I can do for this club - and I hope these are not the last few years I play here.</p>
