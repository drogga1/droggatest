  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> to lead Du Football Champions Clinic in Dubai]</b> We have seen some first class youth footballers in Dubai who we can see are hungry for the opportunity to play professionally. Our final 60 from across the UAE have great potential and I look forward to working more closely with them together with Roberto next weekend before the final selection. Bringing <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, who is working with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> Youth Academy, to oversee the duFC Clinic training programme together with Michel Salgado, reflects our commitment to developing the future of sports in the UAE. We are utilising these stars’ technical expertise and skills in the field, and bringing their passion for youth development onto the UAE sports scene. du Football Championship represents a first-of-its-kind initiative for youth in the country, as it provides the opportunity for them to start a professional football career. We trust that our finalists will reap many benefits from the experience of playing with internationally renowned players on both a personal, as well as a professional level</p>

  <p><b>[Michel Salgado speaks about his former team-mate and current <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> head coach <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> ahead of this weekend’s El Clásico]</b> He’s got character on and off the pitch. He can seem kind of shy but when it comes to normal relationships with people, he’s got a special character. He’s got Algerian blood in there! He’s got that mentality, that hot blood. When people say he won’t have the character to deal with players and to be a winner, they are totally wrong. He’s got a lot of character. He’s a winner as well. He suffers when he doesn’t win. He’s a perfectionist as well</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid legend Michel Salgado was in Dubai this week for the third leg of the duFC Football Champions group stages]</b> Year on year we see kids from all walks of life coming out to duFC for the chance of being discovered and there are indeed great hidden talents across the UAE. In Dubai, after witnessing fantastic talent in the Northern Emirates and Abu Dhabi, my team and I have spotted players with great potential to play internationally, with the right training and commitment. The uniqueness of this platform is that the opportunity it presents to the youth is limitless, anyone can participate and everyone has an equal opportunity to be discovered.</p>

  <p><b>[Michel Salgado says Real Madrid would be ‘crazy’ to spend the same money on Dele Alli as they previously paid Tottenham for Gareth Bale]</b> Obviously they can pursue him because he’s a great player, he’s young, he’s got the ability and he’s got pace, too. But the price is too high, Real Madrid paid big money to Tottenham for Gareth Bale and now if they paid that money for Dele Alli it would be crazy.<br /><br />My question is can he cope with the pressure of playing for Madrid, which is going to be so many times more than at Tottenham. Quality on the pitch he’s got it, but at the moment I don’t know what’s going to happen and hopefully if they do sign him the price will be a little bit cheaper</p>

  <p><b>[Celta Vigo beat Real Madrid to win U13 Dubai Intercontinental Football Cup]</b> It has been a fantastic weekend of football here at Dubai Sports City, you can see all the teams have really enjoyed themselves and learnt a lot along the way. Over the past two days everyone has played really well and I was delighted to see Spanish Soccer Schools win 2-1 against Dubai Club and take home the Plate Cup!</p>

  <p><b>[Time Real Madrid end their embarrassing Liga record by taking Barcelona’s title]</b> We’ve won just one in the last nine years and I think it would be important for the club to win it again. One thing is to be successful at Europe, something which delights us, but we should try to dominate in Spain too because the fans deserve it.</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Ramos will not be affected by continued criticism over his challenge on Mohamed Salah during the Champions League final]</b> No way <b>[it won’t affect him]</b>. He is strong enough to cope with any situation at all. He knows it is part of football. It is a stupid thing, a stupid reflection, if people say he is something to do with Salah’s injury. Of course he had something to do with it but he had no intention <b>[of hurting him]</b>. It was a challenge that was strong into the ball, like we are talking about with any other defender. We are talking about a Champions League final. Any 50/50, you have to go for everything. He dived into him to try and reach the ball, he was unlucky to go over on his shoulder but I know him. There’s no intention to injure Salah, it was an unfortunate situation. To be honest, I was, and even him, we were all really sad for Salah.<br /><br />Hopefully he will be back to his best at the World Cup because the kid has had an unbelievable season and, to be in the mix to win the Golden Ball with two monsters like <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi and <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, you have to do really well. That’s what Salah did and, as I said, Sergio Ramos because of his personality and character, I have no doubt that he won’t be affected by anything off the pitch. He has got his experience, he has got his clear mind and when he is in there performing and ready for the game, he is like a warrior<br /><br />I say that in the final it will be between Messi and Cristiano and another guy which I am happy with. That is Salah, you know it has been 10 years with the same pictures and the same guys dominating football. For football, it has been amazing as well to see two guys dominating. I think it is going to be difficult to see another generation with two players like this one. Although I have to say, in these 10 years with the golden ball, I think it would be fair for a Spanish player <b>[to win]</b>. Anyway, that is something for the French guys <b>[France Football, who run the Ballon d’Or]</b>. Right now, Salah is the only one who can end up or finish this reign of these two guys. How? He needs a good World Cup. Although it is not the same when playing with Egypt, with all due respect of course, than playing with Portugal or Argentina, for your chances to win the World Cup. I have to say that Salah is really in there<br /><br />I remember when he arrived with a white suit from Sevilla. So many things. Even now, I shared with him at his first World Cup in 2006 when I was with him. I was one of the captains in there. So many memories. I think I helped him a lot when he arrived at Madrid. He was playing as a right back, after his first year he was a centre back and then he moved back to right back when I picked up some injuries. Then I couldn’t come back so he did really well as a right back as well. I knew he was going to do really well as a real centre back because he has got the character to do it. That’s why he is the skipper. He is an unbelievable player. The most shocking thing you could see about him was his personality. He was so young but he would step into the dressing room with that personality and with that character which is not easy. We are talking about having in there captains like me, Raul, so many players were still there. So, so many big players, then this kid comes in there and he is being really cocky. That is why he is who he is right now and what he represents for Spain and Real Madrid. It is because of his character.<br /><br />He is the skipper. He came to Real Madrid when he was really, really young, but he is a winner. We could feel that he has a special character, a character that makes you able to be a big player at Real Madrid and the national team. From the first moment we felt it. We could see so many players coming to Real Madrid and not being able to perform. Not because of their quality but because of their mentality, their brain. Ramos was the one who was able to do it since he was very young. He had a special personality. Right now, it is a different situation. He is an experienced guy, he is the skipper of the team. He feels that every time he steps out onto the pitch.<br /><br />As a Real Madrid player and as a national team, obviously, we need him so much. We could see that when he didn’t play at Juventus at home, we lost 3-0. It was 3-1 but it was last minute. You could see that we were missing something on the pitch. It was this. He was the heart of the team. He is very important for us in Spain. He is the one who right now is the leader when we are talking about the dressing room and that’s very important</p>

  <p><b>[Michel Salgado says Cristiano Ronaldo is unsellable for Real Madrid]</b> After what I have seen in the last season, why would they move Ronaldo out of Real Madrid? He is still there in the key moments. We are talking about scoring always in quarter-finals, semi-finals, and knockout stages. When you need him he is there. To be honest, he is performing fantastically, he knows to save his energy for the big moments. He knows his body, he knows his head. He is a real professional guy. He is working hard to be the best. Cristiano is a guy who has to work hard every day to be in there and he is doing it. He is an example in terms of professionalism and, for me, obviously he has to stay in Real Madrid for as long as he wants. He is so much for us. I wanted to see Real Madrid without him for one big game in the Champions League because we never miss him. Obviously it would be really, really different. When he is in there, the opposition defenders are shaking, they know he is in there. It is stupid to say he is too old or whatever. Obviously he is getting mature, he is 33 years old. The physicality is dropping of course. The speed, the pace but he has got something that I don’t think right now that any other player has got. This is the smell to score goals. He has got something special when it comes to the goal. He always puts the ball, at the right time, at the right moment into the goal. That’s something that is priceless right now in football.<br /><br />It is going to be difficult for Cristiano Ronaldo to get there in the next World Cup. Maybe <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi has one more, probably yes. It is one of the last chances they have got to win the World Cup. That’s what the World Cup is all about. Messi and Ronaldo, they know it. They know they have got their last chance to try to win it and that’s why it is going to be an amazing World Cup.<br /><br />To be honest <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is unlucky that we have got our first game against Portugal. There is a rivalry because we are neighbours. There has always been a big rivalry in there and Cristiano Ronaldo is in there. He is our main player in Real Madrid. He is our soul so, for us, it is difficult to see us playing against Cristiano Ronaldo. At the same time because it is a tricky group, whoever loses this game will have a lot of pressure for the second and third game. I see this game with more fear to lose it than action and belief and passion to win it. It is the first game, we know it is difficult and the first game is always important in the World Cup for the way you are going to progress. Let’s see what happens but I am going to tell you, if you lose the first game in this group, it is not going to be easy because you have got Iran and Morocco in the second and third games. I know both teams and to be honest, they are going to make our lives complicated</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal boss Unai Emery is special but can’t handle big names like Ozil]</b> He’s a special manager like <b>[Rafa]</b> Benitez. He needs a squad with no big names, with no big egos. He cannot handle big egos. He needs a squad with team-work players, players that he can shape, that he can develop, that he can get into his system. Then if he’s got depth in his squad and the right players to work for him during the season and they follow him and are ready for it, then he can get results like he did in Sevilla, winning three Europa Leagues back-to-back because the players were ready for him.<br /><br />They were great players, but no big egos, no big names. I think he needs to learn how to deal with egos. He’s still learning. I know in PSG it was difficult for him because those were really big egos. I think, here, the squad is quite big for him. Ozil can be the only one who is a special player because he’s a talented player. It’s the job to try to get him into the system because he will need him. A team like Arsenal needs sometimes a different player, a talented player, that’s Ozil for sure</p>
