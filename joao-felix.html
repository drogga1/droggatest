He would have to work hard.<br /><br /><b>[q: You were at the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> academy with <a href="sergi-roberto.html">Sergi Roberto</a>, <a href="rafinha.html">Rafinha</a> <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Alcantara</a>, Marc Bartra… Was it hard to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?]</b> Yes. I spent many years at the club and I was comfortable in one of the biggest academies in the world, but I had to take the next step in my career. <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> gambled on me and it was the best decision I’ve made<br /><br /><b>[q: You’ve broken through in Lisbon. You’ve won eight trophies and have renewed your contract until 2023]</b> <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> wanted me to renew and I’m very happy. I don’t know what can happen, but I’m just fine <b>[here]</b>. It’s my fourth season, I’ve won lots of trophies and I’m part of a club whose demand is the highest<br /><br /><b>[q: Have you had options to return to Spain?]</b> Things have always been spoken about. I had a very high release clause and <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> didn’t want me to leave. I was happy<br /><br /><b>[q: Last season, you scored seven goals and made 13 assists. Was it your best season?]</b> In terms of numbers, yes; it was very complete, but I feel better every year. I’d spent time with Rui Vitoria and he knew me well, but the arrival of Bruno Lage meant the team changed and we exploited certain attacking qualities.<br /><br /><b>[q: You’re also a specialist in assists. Only <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has more than you this season]</b> Full-backs are almost like the first attackers. We get to the byline a lot and cross it. I’ve worked a lot on my final product and it’s brought results.<br /><br /><b>[q: Freekicks are also one of your strong points. Did you learn from <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?]</b> Everyone takes notice of Leo. When someone scores one freekick in five, you have to learn from him, see how he does it and try to hit the target<br /><br /><b>[q: After various years performing at the highest level, do you think you should have been called up by Spain by now?]</b> I’ve always said it’s one of my objectives. I want to get a call-up; I work for it and there’s still time before the Euros.<br /><br /><b>[q: In your position there is <a href="jordi-alba.html">Jordi Alba</a>, Jose Gaya, Juan Bernat, Sergio Reguilon, yourself… there’s a lot of competition]</b> It’s the Spanish national team and there are great players in every position! We all want to go and we work hard for it. It’s tough, there’s competition, but it’s one of my goals. I’m going to work my best to have the opportunity and, if not, I’ll work even more.<br /><br /><b>[q: You won the Under-19 Euros in 2012 with <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a>, <a href="gerard-deulofeu.html">Gerard Deulofeu</a>, Jese Rodriguez, Suso… under <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a>. Did you think he would’ve helped you get a senior call-up?]</b> He could’ve given me a call-up, <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> <b>[could’ve done]</b>… I have to give my best so that they notice me and call me up. It’s something that I’ll always remember. I was very young, I had the chance to go with <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> and we won. It was very important and now the majority of us are at great clubs<br /><br /><b>[q: Who is the most difficult player you’ve played against?]</b> I’ve played against some very good players but, when I was at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I went up to train with the first team - <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> was incredible when he fronted you up. And <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> always leaves his mark</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Felix admits that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the most difficult team to face in the Champions League]</b> It will be a very difficult tie. Perhaps of all the teams, they are the most difficult team. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are in good shape, in excellent form, they are the defending champions and it will be very difficult, as with any match in the Champions League. But against this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> who are doing very well, it will be even more difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Felix: I had a lot of offers but Atletico were the best fit for me]</b> It is a dream for any player to be able to play in one of the best teams in the world. Atlético is one of them. I had several clubs chasing me but I ended up choosing Atletico because it was the one I liked the most and I think it will give me the best conditions to progress in my career. We work very well together and that is positive<br /><br />I just play to have fun. You don’t have to think you’re going to be the next <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or that you’re going to win this or that. You just have to have fun and enjoy the moment to the fullest</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Felix says Atletico ready for <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> to return]</b> We’re feeling very good and are very excited about playing again. If it were up to us, we would return this weekend but we’ll have to wait and work hard so we can get off to a good start. We worked hard at home to make sure we didn’t lose our fitness and it’s been easy to get back to doing cardio work. Now we’re starting to work with the ball again and will do that every day so we can return to normality. It’s the first day we have been able to come together and we have been playing lots of small-sided games which is what we love doing and what we were missing the most. I missed playing against my team-mates and scoring goals</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> star Joao Felix: My 16-year-old brother Hugo does things I couldn’t at his age]</b> If he listens to those who want to help him, he is going to be successful. He does things I couldn’t do at his age. He has everything to do well and reach the first team. For his age he works a lot. We both like to score. He takes better free-kicks than me, I am better at penalties, but we both play more or less in the same positions. In football you have to play simple, but we like to do something different, something that excites the crowd, and we have some similarities. Since we were little we saw each other playing and tried to do the same things<br /><br />You need a bit of luck to win the Champions League. But we hope to <b>[win]</b> it and if I won the Champions League, it would be something very good in my life and my career. <b>[It would be]</b> one of the happiest days <b>[of my life]</b> - the dream I’ve always had since I’ve been playing football</p>
