Marc is one of the best in the world and without doubt he is the perfect keeper … for Barcelona. The best thing about Ter Stegen is that he makes very few mistakes. He’s perfect for Barca because he starts moves from the back and there aren’t many keepers who can do that.<br /><br /><b>[on Casemiro and Marcelo]</b> They are two of the best in the world in their respective positions. At Madrid it has been evident how important Casemiro is in maintaining the balance of the side, and what can I say about Marcelo? He is the best left back on the planet. Brazil are definitely among the favourites to win the World Cup</p>

After some days when we were bashed a lot we managed to get up again and to show the performance we had hoped for. Of course, I am disappointed.

We started well into the season and had games where we scored three or four goals and nobody was missing him (Ronaldo). It makes no sense to speak about players that aren’t here. He’s an unbelievable player, maybe one of the most important in history. That’s nothing that helps us now. We have to do this without him, that’s the only way, and we’ve showed we can do it. Of course we missed some goals in the last games and today we could have easily won 4-1, 5-1 or 5-2. At the moment it’s a little bit difficult for us to score, but the only way to improve is to continue working and the ball will go in.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos is again confident of Champions League success]</b> It’s normal that Ajax will meet us with maximum motivation and we expect it. It will be two tricky games. They have shown against top teams like Bayern how strong and talented they are. Luckily, in the last few years we were always fully occupied when it came down to it in the Champions League, regardless of the opponent. Otherwise, we would not have won the title three times in a row. And that’s why I’m assuming that, once again, we’ll be able to be there. Firstly, we are in a good mood after the positive results and secondly there is no reason to underestimate Ajax.<br /><br />First of all, every single person has come into shape step by step. But you also see that we act more as a team again, work much more closely toegther than in the first half of the season. This starts with attacking the opponent. We press much earlier and more aggressively. If you do it defensively as a team, you win many balls. The fact that we still have the calmness and the quality in the game with the ball, is currently showing. This is good for everyone. Over such success experiences you win gradually also at mental strength</p>

  <p><b>[Toni Kroos is looking for Germany to show signs of progress against the Netherlands on Friday night]</b> We know each other very well now. Neither team has any secrets from the other. We had chances in all of our games against the Netherlands, and last time we played them we managed to take them and win the game. We have lots of new players, new tactics, a new system. Given there have been so many changes, the last few games have been pretty good. We are well on the way and have made progress already<br /><br /><b>[Kroos will be hoping the new man fits in well in an increasingly youthful-looking German side]</b> There was a big outcry when the coach <b>[cut senior players]</b> earlier this year, but we have improved since then. It wasn’t as difficult as the World Cup. We are not yet at the end of our development. We didn’t play our best game over 90 minutes even when we won in March. I see myself playing at the European Championships, and I want to be consistent</p>

He was about to leave in the summer. After something like that, it is not so easy to get back to normal, but I get the impression that he is very motivated.

If we play well, we win most of the games well. We have to be able to win difficult games. We have left points there.
