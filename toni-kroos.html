This has nothing to do with hitting back against Bayern. Of course, a documentary also includes a review of good and bad things. Everyone generally knows that I had a good time in Munich, otherwise I wouldn’t have been there for seven years. I won the German championship three times and the cup three times. And for the most part I was as a regular player as well.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the documentary]</b> It includes a review of how I felt at that time as an 18, 19-year-old. And there were also things that didn’t satisfy me. But that has nothing to do with hitting back. I’m just reflecting how I felt back then. I am not saying that I was always right in the past, but it was simply how I felt. If you want to call that hitting back then you can, if you only read the headlines but not the text</p>

I will not kill myself if I end my career without having won a European Championship<br /><br />In my opinion I want and need to be here now constantly with the important matches that come along. At the end of the last season I was a little more tired than usually, because it cost much energy to get out of those more negative phases. Also I had some physical problems<br /><br />We have more players now who can hurt the opponent in one-on-ones. But of course we need to get these players into those situations. Maybe we will need a little less passes to get in front of the goal. Still you create goals only in possession. I am ready to adapt, because my main goal is to play successfully</p>

We had chances in all of our games against the Netherlands, and last time we played them we managed to take them and win the game. We have lots of new players, new tactics, a new system. Given there have been so many changes, the last few games have been pretty good. We are well on the way and have made progress already<br /><br /><b>[Kroos will be hoping the new man fits in well in an increasingly youthful-looking German side]</b> There was a big outcry when the coach <b>[cut senior players]</b> earlier this year, but we have improved since then. It wasn’t as difficult as the World Cup. We are not yet at the end of our development. We didn’t play our best game over 90 minutes even when we won in March.

  <p><b>[Toni Kroos admits <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> found it difficult to adjust when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> departed for Juventus]</b> A lot of us didn’t play our best football last season. After three Champions League wins in a row, you could perhaps expect to lose a bit of sharpness and it took us time to adjust to the loss of the 40 or 50 goals <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> guaranteed each year<br /><br />But at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, that’s unacceptable. When we were knocked out by <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> <b>[in the last 16]</b>, many suggested that was the end of this team. We were written off as over the hill but that only provided extra motivation for us to prove them all wrong<br /><br />It reminds me of the way people look at <b>[Roger]</b> Federer.

That’s not easy because some will play more than others but he does it extremely well<br /><br /><b>[Kroos went on to say of the philosophy now being adopted by the Blancos]</b> When I arrived in 2014, we were essentially a counter-attacking side, dropping deep to create space for Gareth <b>[Bale]</b>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> and Karim <b>[Benzema]</b> to make deep runs. But under <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, our philosophy has changed. He wants us to have the ball, and he wants us to win it back quickly. We attack the opposition high up and there is more structure to our game. I prefer it that way. I’d like to have the ball and make opponents run for it rather than run after the ball for 80 per cent of the game and playing two or three decisive passes. That wouldn’t satisfy me. I’ve really benefited <b>[from <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s tactics]</b>. We all have.

  <p><b>[Real Madrid star Toni Kroos has admitted that his side’s chances of winning the Primera Division hinge on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> slipping up in the closing sprint to the finishing line]</b> We can only hope that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> leave something behind. We still lack a little bit of consistency, otherwise we would have gone into the coronavirus break as the league leaders. But that’s now happened. It will depend on who has fewer injuries. You’ll need every player. The deal that deals best with this unfamiliar situation will ultimately also become the champions. The games will show the physical condition of the teams because you can’t simulate that in training, you can only prepare yourself as best you can. In the first game, we’ll see where we are<br /><br /><b>[Madrid will play their home matches, which in common with all the fixtures in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> at present, will be behind closed doors]</b> In my opinion it’s a smart decision. Our second team plays there and the stadium is on our training ground. The dimensions of the field are roughly the same as those at the Santiago Bernabeu. If fans can’t come, you don’t have to play in a stadium for 80,000 spectators, especially since you can continue to work there undisturbed</p>

It was not a good thing but at least there was a reason for it. I remember that Jessi (Kroos’s wife Jessica) then said: ‘We can’t do that (call a doctor) now. Imagine if it came out that I called an emergency doctor for having too much to drink!’. There was no other way <b>[to ease the pain of defeat]</b>. In the end I had to call the emergency doctor myself because I thought: ‘It can’t be allowed to get worse than this.’<br /><br /><b>[Toni Kroos also referred to another night of boozing with his brother, and former Bayer Leverkusen defender Stefan Reinartz, where he ended up drinking tequila shots]</b> because that was the only thing that went down pretty well<br /><br /><b>[It would appear that was the night that put the now 30-year-old off drinking alcohol for good, with Toni Kroos revealing]</b> It was my fault that I wasn’t feeling well the next day.

It didn’t hurt <b>[giving it up]</b> and I don’t miss it</p>
