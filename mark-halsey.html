<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Premier League referee Mark Halsey confused as to why such a directive was not part of the protocol from the start of the campaign]</b> I’m a great believer in the system and I think eventually it will work. I know we’re in its early stages and there are going to be teething problems, but if we, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, follow <a href="ifab.html">the IFAB</a> protocol in the way it’s been written and in the way other leagues around the world are following it, then I don’t think we would have seen as many problems as we’re seeing at the moment. When it’s a subjective call, it’s got to be the on-field referee that views the monitor and makes that final decision. If he sticks to his original decision, everybody would accept that and respect it. But at the moment, we’ve effectively got two referees - one in Stockley Park and one on the field of play<br /><br />If it’s taking six or seven looks and two minutes, then it’s not offside. When we’re looking at a heel or toenail or an armpit, for me, you’ve got to use the naked eye. If you can tell in the first replay that someone’s offside, okay. Let’s go back to what we used to do and give the benefit of the doubt to the attacker. At the moment it’s all in favour of the defenders, not the attacker. The technology is not 100 per cent <b>[accurate]</b>. We can’t be 100% sure in those very tight situations when the ball is kicked</p>
