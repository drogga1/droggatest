  <p><b>[Mexican federation set for CAS hearing regarding controversial chant]</b> I don’t think the fans mean it to be offensive, but it stops being funny when there are sanctions that might affect us or have us sent away from our stadium. The fans themselves wouldn’t like it if they weren’t able to go to the stadium to see their national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico players appeal for respect after qualifying for World Cup]</b> There will always be things to analyze. We understand that you in the press don’t love Osorio’s style. But ultimately, we’ve been effective, we’ve been solid playing in this World Cup qualification cycle. Sometimes we haven’t played well because we’ve played against tough opponents. We’d like to blow everyone out, but our goal was to qualify for the World Cup, and now we’ve done that.</p>

  <p><b>[Russia 2018 likely will mark Andres Guardado’s fourth World Cup for Mexico]</b> still feels like my first time and it could well be my last. Most importantly, it’s my last chance to be part of a team that goes down in Mexican football history. That’s my biggest motivation.<br /><br />I’ve changed quite a lot compared to that long-haired youngster, who started out on the left flank. I used to be more of a box-to-box player, who took people on and got on the end of moves. Now, I’m a central midfielder and hold my position more; I bring balance to the team. What’s still the same, though, is my hunger, my drive to win both individually and as a team. That’s what’s kept me at the highest level<br /><br />Truth be told, I’ve got really bad memories of that World Cup. It was a very strange tournament for me. The coach didn’t fully trust me and I didn’t feel quite right when I played. My most vivid memory is of that game against Uruguay, when we were battling to top the group. He started me, but then pulled me off at halftime, with no explanation whatsoever, and we ended up losing the match. We still went through, but that World Cup left a very sour taste in my mouth. I didn’t enjoy it very much<br /><br />I’ve got lots of great memories of that World Cup, but if I had to single out one, it’d obviously be my goal against Croatia. Scoring at a World Cup is special and it’ll stay with me for the rest of my life</p>

  <p><b>[Andres Guardado is the leader Mexico needs at the World Cup]</b> I’ve changed quite a lot compared to that long-haired youngster, who started out on the left flank.

What’s still the same, though, is my hunger, my drive to win both individually and as a team. That’s what’s kept me at the highest level.<br /><br />Everything starts with believing and dreaming and this doesn’t cost anything. The change of mentality and the titles for Spain came on the back of a lot of failures. In Mexico we have to say it without fear: ‘We can be champions of the world.’ From there, if we we compete at the same level with everyone, the best will come. Greece was the champion of a Euro. If we believe it, we’re closer to getting there than if we don’t believe it</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico seeking balance of belief without overconfidence against Korea]</b> Right now I can proudly tell you that with this group we don’t have to do anything. We’re all so aware of how we’ve been playing, we’re so aware of what we’ve come to do that the win over Germany has made us stronger. The mentally we’ve had coming here and what we’ve said almost every time we’ve been here is that we came to do something different. Tomorrow, I’m confident that myself along with my teammates, we’re going to keep showing it like we showed it in the other game. We know that praise can be dangerous, that it can betray you, but we’ve come here after getting so much criticism that we didn’t believe it. We know soccer is like that, it’s like that in the whole world, but it all changes overnight. Our goal wasn’t to come here and just beat Germany. It goes beyond that, and we’re going to keep working.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico has experienced a dream start to the World Cup]</b> Again, it’s not going to be worth anything if we end up staying in the round of 16. We have to go step by step and we really do want to have a historic World Cup for us. This that just happened isn’t what we came here to do. We see ourselves as being capable of achieving a lot more, and we know what we have in terms of pressure - that we have this infamous fifth game on our back and we’re trying to get not only to the fifth game but rather much farther. But, we’re going game by game.<br /><br />We’ve got to be aware that this game against Sweden is going to be really important for us to look for qualification in the round of 16. We have to keep the team focused on what we want to achieve</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico captain Andres Guardado says the team has been handed the perfect scenario in the face of a difficult World Cup round of 16 match against Brazil]</b> What better motivation can there be other than the fact that we’re facing the game of our lives, against a five-time champion, what more can I say? Obviously, internally we’ve said amongst ourselves that this is the perfect scenario. We’re not going to have any excuse like this. If we get it, it’s because we did things really well. If we’d finished first in the group and with all respect to Switzerland, if we’d beaten Switzerland people would’ve said, ‘Oh it’s because it’s Switzerland.’ That’s how we are <b>[in Mexico]</b>. So we’re up against the perfect scenario against Brazil, the five-time champion and it’s a great scenario. We’re all really excited about this opportunity football has given us, a situation that can’t get any better, and hopefully we’re able to finally take this step.<br /><br /><b>[Guardado said El Tri has the depth to replace Hector Moreno]</b> What makes me calm is that I think we’re all ready to play. We’re a team made up of 23 players who all have the ability to be starters. Ultimately, it’s about what the manager decides and if we feel better about one thing or another, well we came here with a united group and what the manager says is going to be the best for the team. That’s how we’re going to take it.<br /><br />You learn more from the defeats than the victories because you want to reduce all the bad things from that game. I think the game against Sweden taught us a lot of lessons, above all about playing against this style of play, not just Sweden but this style overall, Europeans, direct play, aerial game, we’ve really struggled against these types of opponents</p>

  <p><b>[On Neymar]</b> We all know Neymar, so it’s not on me or on us to judge him, but rather the referees, and FIFA. Now, with VAR, they have to see his style of play and know how to manage the game because we know he likes to exaggerate fouls, to throw himself around. That’s his style of play and the one who has to judge that and put a stop to it is the referee, not us.</p>

  <p><b>[El Tri would have been down had it not been for a save off the line from midfielder Andres Guardado]</b> Some guys didn’t come for injuries and such, but that opened the door for other talents, for the future of this national team, which showed in this tournament that they’re on a really good path. As a Mexican and a veteran player, it makes you calm because you know you’re leaving the team in good hands and they definitely can achieve what maybe you couldn’t in so many years</p>
