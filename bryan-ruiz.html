  <p><b>[Costa Rica expects tough Mexico despite injuries]</b> I think the game is going to be really complicated. Of course Andres Guardado is a very important player for Mexico, but they have players who are definitely good enough to replace him. I don’t think it changes anything for us. Oscar already has gone over what potential replacements there could be for Guardado.</p>

  <p><b>[Bryan Ruiz says he is blocking out the chaos at Sporting CP]</b> The Sporting situation isn’t in my mind. I am out of contract so I have no problems with any of that. I will take my decision on the next club after this World Cup and that’s the only thing. I feel good, I prepared myself as best as I could. We were hoping to get a better result. We were hoping to, at least, not lose. It is a pity that we had a couple of openings before they scored to make it 1-0. We didn’t take them and after they scored a great goal. We tried to go forward together to get it to 1-1 but we couldn’t do it.<br /><br />I felt good going into this tournament. We play as a team and we don’t play as individuals. I think that’s our strength and has been for a while and we will keep doing that. Myself, I just try to do my best and I think in the next few games I will feel even better</p>
