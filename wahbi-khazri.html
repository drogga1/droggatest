  <p>[Tunisia go into the game in Volgograd boasting the return of Wahbi Khazri and Ali Maaloul who have both recovered from injuries] I am 100 percent ready to face England, I have no more pain. It is going to be a tough game against a big team. I hope we are in good shape that day and our aim is to win.</p>

  <p>[Wahbi Khazri, reborn in Ligue 1] I knew that I had qualities and I knew what I was capable of doing here. Yann wanted me to come at all costs. He told me great things about the club, the squad and the staff. He told me that if I signed, I wouldn’t regret it. It’s nice to be wanted, especially when the coach likes you. I had great feedback about him and my move has confirmed it. He’s done great work everywhere he’s been and really knows the game. As they say, he stinks of football!.<br /><br />[Sabri Lamouchi at Rennes who first deployed him as a striker] That repositioning as a striker made me aware that he was doing me a lot of good. I’ve become mature. I’m more effective in my play and I drift less</p>

  <p>[Kylian Mbappe has seen his qualities hailed as exceptional] In terms of talent, Mbappe is out of the norm, and what he does is exceptional. But, when playing against PSG, I find Neymar more impressive. I think Neymar, what he does, he has this ability to decide any game. It’s true that Mbappe, with his speed, he explodes past everyone, but Neymar has such talent with the ball. Those who do not enjoy watching Neymar play do not like football, it’s that simple!</p>
