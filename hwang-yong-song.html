  <p>[Hwang Yong Song was delighted that his team would face last year’s runners-up Bengaluru FC in the tie] Our football team is one of the strongest in DPR Korea and we are happy to enjoy the tournament. We think Bengaluru FC is a very strong team and have good players in defense and midfield. We are happy to have a match with them<br /><br />We have seen their [Bengaluru FC] videos. There are four Indian national team players and some foreign players. We think their players are good<br /><br />Our team has many young players. They have been training together for a long time. Kim Yu Song [Nine goals already in the tournament] is one of the youngest players in our team. He is good in attack. In the Olympics Games, Under-23, he scored many goals. He is an important player for our team. Our team has no foreign players. I think our players are good enough<br /><br />This is the first time we are participating in the AFC Cup. We are facing Bengaluru FC tomorrow and if we win this game we proceed to the next stage. We would like to participate more often in the AFC Cup</p>

  <p>[April 25 SC coach rues unideal weather conditions] We came to Bangalore for the game. The idea was to keep the score to a minimum. The draw would have been good. The condition was not good for the defenders. I think BFC players’ physical condition is good.<br /><br />While our attackers struggled in attack, the Bengaluru strikers were very fast and hence, our defenders couldn’t defend. Today, it was very bad. We didn’t expect it to rain so much<br /><br />[He benched his main striker Kim Yu Song] He had hurt his back. His physical condition wasn’t good</p>
