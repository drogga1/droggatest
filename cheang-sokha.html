<blockquote>
  <p>Thai activist and former yellow-shirt leader Veera Somkwamkid, imprisoned since 2010 on spying charges, has been granted a royal pardon, the prime minister’s spokesman announced today at a late-afternoon press conference. Acting Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow requested the pardon during a two-day visit to the capital to discuss migrant worker regulations<br /><br />Veera and his secretary, Ratree Pipattanapaiboon, were arrested in December 2010 with five other Thai nationals in a disputed border area in Banteay Meanchey province. Veera and Ratree were convicted the following February on charges of illegal entry and espionage and given prison sentences of eight and six years, respectively. Ratree was granted a royal pardon last February along with another 400 prisoners released on the sidelines of the funeral for King Father Norodom Sihanouk.<br /><br />Today’s pardon was accompanied by a reiterated request from Hun Sen that the Thai junta release 14 Cambodian migrant workers jailed earlier this month after they were caught with fake visas</p>
