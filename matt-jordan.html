  <p><b>[AJ Delagarza delivering experience and stability in Dynamo resurgence]</b> Discussions were going on for quite some time. It kind of stalled for a bit and then it really heated up again around the draft. But when the opportunity came to add A.J. DeLaGarza to our roster, we felt it was an important addition and we wanted to move quickly.<br /><br />What stands out about A.J. is he fits the mold of what we outlined as our offseason targets, which was to add more leadership, more of a winning mentality to the locker room and to the field, and also a top professional and a top person<br /><br /><b>[Jordan spoke of how DeLaGarza’s contributions]</b> What we really like about A.J. is he takes a lot of pride in defending. He’s been a very steady presence. There’s been a lot of talk about our offseason acquisitions on the attacking end but for us as a club, we feel that A.J.’s been one of the most important additions to our team this season</p>
