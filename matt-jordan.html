  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera sacked as Houston Dynamo coach amid poor patch in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> play]</b> We’d like to thank Wilmer for all of his hard work and dedication over the course of the last two and a half seasons with the Houston Dynamo, including last year’s U.S. Open Cup title. We wish him all the best moving forward. At this time, we as a club believe the team will benefit from a fresh perspective as we enter the final third of our season and make a push to qualify for the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tab-ramos.html">Tab Ramos</a> has left his role with the U.S. U-20 men’s national team to take over as head coach of the Houston Dynamo]</b> We are very pleased to welcome Tab to the Houston Dynamo. He brings a wealth of coaching experience to our club, having led the U.S. U-20 National Team program to unprecedented success over the last eight years. As we went through the search process, we were impressed with how his approach to the game aligned with our club’s goals and objectives. We are confident that his experience, coaching philosophy, and ability to teach and relate to players make him the right coach to lead our team moving forward</p>
