  <p><b>[Barcelona vs <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>. <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> boss Javi Calleja was at pains to point out that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s problems have very much been a case of travel sickness]</b> It’s true they would have wanted a better start to the season, but it’s been away from home that they have been touched. At home, they’ve shown their potential and their quality. They’re one of the best teams in the world. We’ve started well but we know what <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are<br /><br /><b>[While the <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Yellow Submarine</a> may have picked up a head of steam thanks to a draw against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> followed by wins over Leganes and Valladolid, Calleja predicts a very different type of match in store for his side]</b> They base their game on possession, with great individuals, and that demands that we’re perfect to get a positive result</p>

  <p><b>[Javi Calleja says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were not as ‘superior’ to <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> after <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> went off]</b> <b>[Messi]</b> played the first half. The team worked to ensure he was not decisive. When he’s on the pitch he makes a difference, although it’s true he had some discomfort. Without <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> they are not as superior, that is evident, but we know how to stop them. We were unable to do more damage or defend better at the beginning. We are hurt by the defeat, but happy with our job<br /><br /><b>[Ansu Fati replaced <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> with 12 minutes remaining and went close to sealing the three points before seeing an appeal for a penalty turned down following a VAR review]</b> I was amazed. He did everything right. He has huge quality and he is not weighed down by the responsibility. For a football lover he is a joy to watch</p>
