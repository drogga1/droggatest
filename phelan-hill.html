  <p><b>[Hill believes that both football and motor racing have shown the huge reach of esports during the coronavirus pandemic]</b> At the moment, you’ve got this gap in live sport and all sport at the moment is thinking ‘how can we stay engaged with our fan base?’. So various sports are looking at it. The best two sports at it currently are Formula One and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. Formula One really tried to develop their esports competition over time, while football clubs benefit from having the best sports simulation game on the market. It’s realistic, you’ve got all the teams in the game, people are playing it across the world and you have 35 million users. There’s a ready-made platform and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, the federation, have made a lot of investment in it. So Formula One and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> have had very strong platforms to build off and now you’re seeing individual clubs benefit off the back of it<br /><br />It has really helped with the acceptance of esports and you’ve seen some traditional sports who have been bold enough to push it forwards and they’ve had really positive results. <br /><br />Other, more conservative sports will have taken notice. It’s not just people in their rooms playing games. It’s opened up people’s eyes. What’s been the biggest game changer is that live sport has been stopped and now the real-life sports stars are able to engage in the games and has driven audience numbers. Formula 1 have magnificently benefitted from having <b>[real-life drivers]</b> Charles Leclerc, Lando Norris, Max Verstappen all get involved. It’s a great thing for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when you have the likes of <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="moussa-sissoko.html">Moussa Sissoko</a>, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> getting involved. That’s been a huge positive shift. At the end of the day, you know these guys play it at home but they wouldn’t have had time before to play in the tournaments because they have training to do and are on a schedule. I think it’s been a two-way relationship. Esports has massively benefited from having sports stars behind it and help to drive their audience, but at the same time, the sports stars are seeing the benefit as well. Lando Norris, the McClaren driver, was one of the first people to get involved with Formula 1 Esports. Since he’s got involved with live streaming himself racing, he added 300,000 new followers on social media in a week or so and has seen a 14% increase in the level of engagement on his accounts as well as 6.5 million total views on his Twitch streams. The mutual benefit can only be a good thing.</p>
