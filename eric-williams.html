  <p>[Melaka United FC head coach Eric Williams is determined to build and improve his squad] I think we surprised Selangor today and I think they will be dissapointed. Our attacking lines combined well today. In fact the goalscorer was one of our midfielders. We are still a work in progress and we can build on from what we did today. I know they can do better. We are hoping to improve that through the week. Our next game will be another away game. It will be very difficult so we need everyone to recover first.</p>

  <p>[Melaka United head coach, Eric Williams is hoping that Melaka United’s win over PKNS FC will boost the team’s confidence] I think it is great [first win of the season]. The players wanted to prove to the supporters that they have the ability and the desire to take us to the next round. [The win] also can build the confidence within the team. It is a very positive sign for our upcoming games.<br /><br />A few of our players played really well. I think PKNS FC scored eight goals before they came here so they have a good firepower. We based our formation obviously trying not to concede. It was 0-0 at halftime and we were doing quite well. Second half really tested our characters so I am very proud and happy for the players/ The main focus today is to defend and to avoid from conceding early goal. Once we did that, we can be stronger as a team, and we started to create chances</p>

  <p>[Eric Williams is fully aware of the threat that Sarawak can pose this Saturday] Sarawak’s six goals against MISC-MIFA in the FA Cup have proven what they can do.</p>

  <p>[Melaka will be playing their rescheduled away league match against Kelantan on Tuesday, just three days after recording a 1-0 away win over Sarawak] On Tuesday in Kelantan, [we have] a rescheduled match, I have to say I’m not happy with this. We should not have to play now. We should play [it] later in March like another team [JDT] that had a delayed match against Kelantan. They’re playing it in April. It’s not fair. Our players are now going to play two games away from home, and then go back and it’ll be three games in eleven days. It’s not healthy, I don’t think it’s actually fair, to be quite frank.<br /><br />I hope in the match against Kelantan we won’t be too overawed by them. We must play with team spirit and winning mentality</p>

  <p>[Melaka United FC head coach Eric Williams has downplayed his decision not to field skipper and forward Ilija Spasojevic in the match] …it’s not one individual who makes the team, we have to work as a team, as a group. Basically we had to change our formation a little bit to make up for Spaso’s absence. Possibly he may or may not have made the difference but at the moment he doesn’t really care, because now we have to go to Pulau Pinang on Wednesday.<br /><br />[He however blamed on the scheduled fixtures] I’d like to say that our team were very tired. It was a very unfair practice for us to play on Tuesday in Kota Bharu [against Kelantan], flew all the way back on Wednesday, only a session on Thursday. And yesterday [Friday] in our light session our players were just too tired. You could see it in their performance.<br /><br />[He also expressed his frustration at Pahang’s time-wasting tactics] Well it’s frustrating when you can see the players were putting the pressure on the opponents, and the opponents were obviously wasting time, because it killed our momentum. I was very disappointed that the referee only gave five minutes [of injury time]. I thought it was more about seven, possibly eight<br /><br />I am very proud of the players, we had a bad start, they scored two very good goals, our defence was a bit undermanned. We just left it too late in the second half, we should have played with a little bit more determination earlier, and a little bit more belief. I think we gave Pahang a bit too much respect. But they’re a very good team with a lot of history, whereas it’s our first year [back] in the league</p>

  <p>[Eric Williams praised their opponents for nicking a point against his men] I thought we played much better in the first half, in the second half we knew what Pulau Pinang were going to do. They have to attack us so we were going to get one or two opportunities to counter attack. But the quality of our passes in the counter attacks was poor… They [Pulau Pinang] made it very difficult for us, because the ball kept coming back. …Credit to Pulau Pinang, they fought very hard, [and] we couldn’t maintain our defensive quality, and eventually they scored.<br /><br />I knew it was going to be difficult. Every game Pulau Pinang keep playing, obviously they are going to get stronger. …To be honest, they should’ve won the game. They had chances to finish us [off], because we did not put our second goal in and they just kept pushing.<br /><br />He suffered the same injury which forced him to sit out against Pahang. I had said to him; ‘have a rest for this match’ and we have another important match coming up. But he wanted to play and now he’s down again. So I would say he won’t be ready for a few weeks. It’s very disappointing when you lose your main striker in the first 10 minutes<br /><br />Fauzi Roslan did okay, we still have Aguero [forward Sergio Aguero], he was obviously tired because he had not played for many weeks so hopefully he can recover. Jeon Woo [midfielder Jeon Woo Young] will come back in. I rested him tonight [although] he could have played. I decided to leave him out because I did not want to do any more damage to his injury. So we just have to make sure that we can recover quickly, and obviously face a strong team at Kedah’s home ground</p>
