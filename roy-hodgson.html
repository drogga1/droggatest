There will be no one making their debut from the start but there will be one or two players who won’t have had many starts.<br /><br />I’ve been lucky that we’ve played in front of full houses and it will be a new experience tomorrow but, as Gary Neville has pointed out, there were times when he was playing where they got 25,000, so let’s keep things in perspective<br /><br />Obviously it <b>[crowd]</b> is a bit lower than normal but we expected that, the World Cup was disappointing and it’s a backlash from that.

If every time we play a game I’ve got to praise a player to the skies or criticise him and say it’s not going to work, I think that’s a little bit harsh.

People swear - and I swear.<br /><br />What sort of world are we living in? You are scraping the bottom of a barrel to say something negative from me swearing. I’m a football coach. I played in the non-League with dockers whose every other word was a swear word. They didn’t even know they were swearing because they didn’t know any other words. If you asked me why, I couldn’t tell you. I think my vocabulary is good enough to allow me not to do it.<br /><br />If you get it written down, ‘We are very annoyed and morally offended by Hodgson, the England manager, using a swear word. And we insist that in the future he never swears … ‘ then, okay, I will never swear in your company again. I just thought I was with mature enough people to understand that a swear word, which I thought was probably used at the right time, should not provoke a fit of moral indignation. I will put the message forward quite strongly, even a little bit aggressively sometimes. But there was no need for me to be upset and there was no ill feeling. The pressure is the pressure in this job. I don’t know I can feel more pressure than I put myself under. The pressure sometimes unfortunately will come from outside and there is not so much you can do about it</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson has dismissed any notion that sweeping changes will be made to the England team after their disastrous World Cup campaign]</b> Unfortunately not, and we’ve been racking our brains. It’d be nice to say there’s been lots of lessons but there are more minor ones. We’ve got to be aware when people talk about being more streetwise, I’ve never quite understood what street wisdom really is. Those types of minor criticisms or suggestions, they’ve all got some sort of relevance I guess. You’ve got people suggesting we’ve got to commit more fouls and stop people in their tracks - I’m not even 100 per cent certain that’s something you coach, it’s never featured in my coaching sessions. But I think as players mature and play Champions League football and play in the Premier League every week and play international football these sort of lessons come automatically. They come as you get older and more experienced and as you harden up as a footballer. It would be nice <b>[to say]</b> from the World Cup we’ve learned this major lesson but our world Cup really was the one game against Uruguay, we’ve got to be careful that we don’t consider throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<br /><br />Someone of David’s stature, with his qualities and personality, I’m 100 per cent certain if he can find the time to lend his presence to the FA they would be happy to find a role for him. If he could make himself available for England in some way or another I have no doubt in my mind that <b>[FA chairman]</b> Greg Dyke and <b>[FA general secretary]</b> Alex Horne would welcome his presence within an England capacity</p>

It is a big test.<br /><br />I want to see how the players perform. This will be a big test for them, it is. I want to see how they come up to speed on that test. I want the result and if you ask me what would you prefer - to play badly and win or to play well and lose, I’d play badly and win. I’m not different to anyone else in that respect. We do have to lift our heads up a little bit and performances and how we play and what happens is of vital importance to us</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson believes the first goal was crucial in England’s hard-fought 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Switzerland]</b> I’m just pleased to see the boys play well the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted. We got our reward for once, we made hard work of it, there were plenty of chances before Danny’s goal but it was a good performance against one of the best teams in the group. In the first half they were a bit content to let us dominate and we pressurised the ball well. You need that first goal to open people out, then they started to come at us. From then I thought we looked dangerous and we had several chances to aggravate the scoreline before Danny Welbeck’s second.<br /><br />I still think there are areas we have to improve, you can’t expect players playing in their early games or even their debut not to make mistakes. There are areas we can work on and we have two years to do that</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Roy Hodgson insists he was pleased with the way his midfield diamond functioned in his side’s 2-0 win over Switzerland]</b> We thought this could be a good system for our players. I have said many times recently that the six players I have got in front of the back four, there is enormous potential in them. They have got youth, energy, talent and they can play in different positions so Sterling can play wide and central.<br /><br />Wayne learnt it long ago and if you are going to have a big career as an England player you have to take the responsibility and it comes with criticism and enormous scrutiny. I am just pleased that some of the criticism of Wayne of late, at a time when he has been anxious to show how good he is and how much he wants to do this job, I was delighted tonight he could marry the two things together. There has never been any doubt for me in the games where he has been criticised that he has not been doing the absolute maximum. <b>[It was the]</b> best he can do but forwards play small margins and if a few passes go astray or a few goals chances get missed that is when the criticism lands on you and it was nice tonight to see him do that</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson plays down Daniel Sturridge rift with Brendan Rodgers]</b> No, there’s been no question of manoeuvring on our part or Liverpool’s part. It’s just simply a fact, an unfortunate fact, that he’s not recovered. It’s a great blow to us, Liverpool and the player, because he was anxious to be a part of these two games. There’s no problems or conflict there at all. He’s not played for Liverpool at all since picking up the injury with us. As I understand it he’s still got some work to do before he’s fully fit. There was no question of him being selected.<br /><br />We always try to do that. The last thing you want is to get injuries in training, even more so as an international manager because you feel a responsibility to the clubs. People need to consider that we have such a shortage of time. On this particular occasion we had two days and two training sessions to try and hone a very different way of playing. If I’m going to be put under pressure as the England manager in future to give every player two days off every time they play, then we won’t train at all quite frankly</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Roy Hodgson insists Daniel Sturridge wanted to train when he was injured on international duty in September]</b> I don’t remember that. That’s dangerous, that one. I don’t remember that at all. That’s interesting. We will check that up with other members of staff. I don’t have any memory of Daniel telling me that he didn’t want to train. He never asked <b>[to be given 48 hours]</b>. I’ve never been asked to give 48 hours to any player. If I am under pressure to give each player two days off between games we won’t train at all. If every time we give two days off, we will be down to 20 days’ training in the course of the next year and a half. For me that is unacceptable. We need to work with the players. The interesting thing for the session where Daniel got injured is that he was quite keen to take part because he was such an important part of it, and we were trying to develop a new system of play. He was the forward who understood it best. He was more than happy to come in and help us to get our points over. I understand Brendan being unhappy. We are never happy when we send a player back injured, but we do our best.</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Roy Hodgson does not believe captain Wayne Rooney has a temperament issue in the wake of his three-game Premier League ban]</b> People suggested there was a lack of discipline and so on but, in my dealings with him, nothing could be further from the truth. If someone wants to write that Rooney hasn’t got the temperament I can’t stop them doing it. But they are wrong.<br /><br />Everyone knows Wayne is not the sort of person with his Liverpool accent who is going to be able to stand up in front of a lecture room of people. But he doesn’t need to. All he has to do is make certain the players he is talking to understand where he is coming from. The great thing with Wayne, as it was with <b>[his predecessor]</b> Steven <b>[Gerrard]</b>, is the passion that they have for football, for their country, and for their clubs - both were basically one-club men if you take Rooney leaving Everton at a young age. They can transmit that passion to a lot of those younger players. They can get their points across. They won’t do it maybe quite as eloquently as someone like myself could, but that doesn’t matter. He will get the message across and the message will be more powerful coming from him. We want to tap into that</p>

The players who played did a good job and they deserve a further confidence. Other players are knocking on the door and I’ve got to weigh the two things very carefully … keeping the team together but maybe also using at least one of these two games as a chance to see someone else playing. The players look very sharp, very focused. We haven’t trained for long periods of time but what we’ve done has been really good. When I do announce the team <b>[on Thursday]</b> there will be a lot of disappointed faces because everyone has been working hard.<br /><br />I’m pleased for <b>[Welbeck]</b>, of course. He’s been in my plans throughout the two years <b>[that I’ve been in charge]</b>. He’s always someone that I follow very closely.

That type of desire in a game where you’ve wrapped up the game is very commendable. It was a job well done. The crowd <b>[55,990]</b> were fantastic, they’ve had an enjoyable night and saw a lot of attacking football. It could have been more but I can’t fault the players. I’m pleased we’ve got this game behind us, we won it comfortably and added five goals to our tally. In the first half of these games when they’re getting 10 men behind the ball, that’s the time you’ve got to wear them down and keep plugging away and doing the right things. If you do that, it’ll open up in the second half and there’ll be chances. The way the players approached it was very good. What we learnt was the players have got the ability against teams doing this to do the right thing for 90 minutes.</p>

When he shows signs of not being quite as sharp, not doing as well, trying too hard, that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break. I don’t think the situation will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it. But that is not the case at the moment and I don’t think Liverpool need to worry. In the first half against San Marino he was a lively as he could have been. At half-time I said ‘I am taking you two off’ <b>[Sterling and Jordan Henderson]</b> and they looked at me like ‘don’t do that - we want to stay on’ and that is quite nice.</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Roy Hodgson insists he has no problem with facing smaller nations]</b> It’s a subject for people at Uefa to ponder over. I’ve been asked the question before and also answered that it isn’t my business. It would create a lot of logistical and calendar problems and also there is the moral issue. Why should some countries be less worthy than others? But that’s something that really doesn’t bother me at the moment. When Uefa make a decision - if they make one - then we’ll be happy to abide by it, but in the meantime we’re perfectly happy to meet teams like San Marino and play against them.<br /><br /><b>[Hodgson shrugged off suggestions his side could win all 10 of their pre-Euro 2016 matches]</b> It’s hard to say if winning all 10 games is realistic.

But he scored the winner and we go away with three more points.<br /><br />We played well in the first half, we played some excellent football without taking our chances and that meant that there was an air of frustration setting in and an air of pressure going out in the second half.

So I said, ‘Best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I bring you on from the bench,’ simple as that. When he came on there was nothing wrong with him. Perhaps it’s quite simply the season hasn’t started quite as well for Liverpool as they wanted.

But we have never had any problems with that. I don’t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two-day recovery so if you want to, you might want to research that one. Certainly, the Germans, who you admire so much, don’t do it. That is for certain. But obviously we always did and we did it from the start. We had people like John Terry, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard who I felt would be better off having an extra day or whatever. I would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two-day recoveries but on the other hand it could easily be like this <b>[international break]</b> when we did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training the day after the <b>[San Marino]</b> game.

  <p><b>[​England manager Roy Hodgson has praised the work-rate and desire of captain Wayne Rooney]</b> Since he has been made captain, I think he has taken an even further step, both at Manchester United and with us. He’s really taken on this job as captain with enormous seriousness. He’s studied and talked a lot with Steven Gerrard. He spends a lot of time with the younger players. And obviously with me he’s very good. If there’s anything he thinks I should be made aware of, he makes me aware of it. Every time he gets on the field, he really does work hard. Even when we are not playing as well as I think we can play, it’s very rare that I can look at him and think ‘you’re not working hard enough’. I would defy anyone to fault his work-rate, his desire, if they watch the game carefully and study what he does.</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Roy Hodgson praised Slovenia after his team came from behind to secure a 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win at Wembley]</b> It was not going to be an easy game ever because they were disciplined and well organised. We had a lot of possession in the first half. We were probing but we weren’t really getting beyond them and creating the number of chances. When we went a goal down it was very, very important to break straight back. We did with the penalty and after that our play was certainly better. I thought we created a lot more chances. In the end it proved to be a very good victory because we’ve seen today that Slovenia have been good value for their six points and their two victories so far. Now, in the group, we’ve beaten Switzerland away and Slovenia at home, which puts us in a good position.<br /><br />I thought we kept our shape well all the time, even when we weren’t playing our best football. We won the ball back quickly and sustained attacks, but it was really frustrating that we weren’t creating the chances that our ball possession could have given us. In the second half I thought that was better. The chances were coming one after the other and it gave us three goals, which was more than enough to win the game.</p>

If you’ve got several other goalscorers and you can afford to use one of your goalscorers a bit further back, that’s fine.

Now I hear it’s going to be another six months, so I can only hope that Danny recovers a bit quicker and hits the ground running. I’ve got to make certain there are a few Jamie Vardys and Harry Kanes and Theo Walcotts because we can’t keep going around talking about the ones who aren’t there. What we’re trying to develop is a bigger pool of players, to get that up to 30, where we can say: ‘Whatever happens, as long as we can get 23 of this 30, we’ll be OK’.

I’m more than happy to speak to the boy. I’m more than happy to speak to his manager and more than happy to speak to his parents. We’ve spoken to him and what we’ve said, quite simply, is that we think he is a very talented footballer. We think he could have a very good international career and we would be more than happy if he chose that career to be England. I’m still hoping that’s what he will do but at the same time because of his grandparents he has the opportunity to play for Ireland.<br /><br />I made it clear to him: ‘It’s got to be your decision, it’s got to be something you really want to do and that feels right because I certainly don’t want to put you under any undue pressure and I’m not going to resort to artificial means to get you with us and stop you playing elsewhere.

  <p><b>[Bournemouth vs Crystal Palace]</b> From what I understand from the Burnley game, it was one of those where they weren’t exactly outplayed and thrashed 4-0, but they conceded goals at the wrong time and the rest of the game was a pretty even affair. But they took their chances and, if you don’t, you end up looking like you have been totally and utterly outplayed. But I understand that wasn’t the case and it was a pretty even game up there and Bournemouth played well enough but were on the end of a bad result. We know how good they are and, in particular, we know how good they are at home and we are preparing for a tough test, a very tough test.</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson thinks Wayne Rooney left England too early]</b> He left England too early. He still has much to offer. There is no doubt the talent he has, showing he could still play top-level English football. But it was his decision and after Manchester United and Everton, where he had tremendous affinity, deep roots, maybe he would not have been that interested in playing for another English club outside those two. It was a conscious decision to play abroad. I have a great deal of respect for Wayne, and I think he does for me.<br /><br />I would have loved him here at Palace, but he thought long and hard about his decision, and without a shadow of doubt would have talked it over with his family. I am delighted to see what success he is having. I guess he is doing what DC United were really hoping for when they signed him. They just didn’t want a figurehead but also a player who can win them matches, and he has done that. He is doing fantastically well. At DC they were well down in the league when he got there, although they hadn’t played too many games, but since he’s arrived he has been fantastic, not just scoring goals, but decisive goals, like the one we saw in midweek</p>

  <p><b>[By Roy Hodgson’s own admission, the safety of another season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been a welcome relief for <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> in the most disjointed of seasons]</b> <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> has always been a club very dear to me and you never forget your boyhood team and the team you supported from the terraces first of all, that’s always going to stay with you. Of course, it’s a club I think has potential too. We’re finding that it’s always a battle to stay in the league, but less of a battle this year and perhaps even less of a battle last year than the one previous to that. We need to work that little bit harder to make sure our squad is strong enough to make certain that every year, there’s not going to be a question of ‘are we going to stay in the league’, it’s going to be more of a question of ‘how high can we get? Can we make certain we finish in the top half rather than the bottom?’<br /><br />That’s the next challenge for the club. That’s the next step forward that I like to think we can take and it would be nice to be a part of that just like it’s been nice to be a part of the last three seasons, albeit the first two of them were a little bit hair-raising at times because it was all about looking over your shoulders and worry that you were going to be sucked into that dreaded relegation zone.<br /><br />We had a very good spell of four straight wins, which is fantastic and took us into a really good position. That lifted us up into a very comfortable mid-table position and a top 10 position at that moment in time. We always knew there were some very tough games coming up to get through in the last eight, as it would have been then, and there was a risk that you wouldn’t necessarily keep that run of victories going<br /><br />We’ve got to keep our sense of perspective and most importantly of all, we’ve got to be more than satisfied with the season the club has had and what these players have done for the club. My previous two seasons with the club has been a fight against relegation from the first moment to the last and on this occasion, we found ourselves in the situation with nine games to play, free of relegation worries and it is testament to the excellent work the players did to get us into that position<br /><br />Are we satisfied with it? No, of course we’re not. We would like to win every game, but we also know we have our work cut out because teams like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> - who are all coming here - will have a lot to play for and have a lot of quality in their team and will be asking many questions of us<br /><br />I think we’ve found <b>[the restart]</b> very hard as we always knew we would because we have a situation where the average age of our squad is quite high - it’s the highest in the league - and we don’t have a very big squad<br /><br />We don’t have an awful lot of players, we’ve still got three senior players out injured and the size of our squad didn’t really allow for that. We really need a full week of preparation and a full week of recovery, but we always knew that wasn’t going to happen so it’s not a complaint, it’s just an explanation about why we have found it a bit harder<br /><br />We will continue to find it hard, not least of all because the remaining games were going to be very tough but fortunately, we were able to use the previous 29 to get ourselves into a good position<br /><br />The only game really we can look at and say we were disappointed that we didn’t do a lot better was the <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> game but credit to them, they came here and played well, we had our chances in the second half to equalise but we didn’t take them<br /><br />Against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, I thought the performance was more than satisfactory and the result wasn’t actually a true reflection of the game. We paid for the mistakes we made and they defended well and they won the game and deservedly so because they got the goals. But it wasn’t a question of being bitterly disappointed with the teams performance, I think you’ve always got to look at the form and the results<br /><br />Sometimes you get results that don’t necessarily reflect the way the game has gone and when they go in your favour, you tend to dismiss the good fortune or dismiss the things that weren’t that good and you got away with. Conversely, when you lose a game, you tend to dismiss a lot of the things that were quite good and concentrate on the fact that some things didn’t go so well and you lost the game<br /><br /><b>[Facing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Their intelligence, their understanding of the game, their interest tactically, they were definitely the thinking man’s player. When you get a player like that, it’s hardly surprising if he wants to <b>[become a manager]</b> because these days, there are very good players who probably do have the potential, they go down a different route in football<br /><br />With management, every week you’re being judged and criticised and it puts your reputation and body on the line every week. I’m really glad Frank chose to do it and Steven as well and I certainly didn’t have any doubts that if they chose to go down that route, they would be big successes, not only because of their knowledge, but also their personalities and their interest and depth of knowledge about the game<br /><br />They were always bound to be thinking coaches and managers too so it’s nice to see both of them getting the chance in their first jobs at a very good level. It seems to be that both clubs have got behind their choice, they believed in their choice and rightly so. As a result, they’re reaping the rewards<br /><br />I thought <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were looking good before the break and they’ve come back and continued that. They’re a very good team with many good players and irrespective of our own position at this moment in time, it would have been a very difficult game to play in<br /><br />All we can do is prepare for it and look forward to it, I know we will do our best and work very hard to try and make life as difficult for them as possible but we are 100 per cent aware of the challenges which are going to be presented to us with the quality they have<br /><br />It’s a bit dangerous giving advice but you’ve got to really want to do it. I don’t think you should go into coaching on management unless you really believe this is something you want to do. You’ve got to be prepared that it won’t be all sunshine and roses, there’s going to be plenty of difficult moments. The really good moments you find sometimes get cancelled out by the doom and gloom, that’s going to be part of your life however successful you are. You’ve got to come to terms with that so you have to have quite a strong constitution<br /><br />Then I think you’ve got to be prepared to do the relevant amount of studying. These days, it’s not just a question of hanging up your boots after being a good player and going straight into the manager’s office the next day and dictating what training is going to be like, you’ve got to go through all the preparations with your coaching badges and you even need to do management diplomas. You need to get yourself onto those courses and there are a lot of leadership seminars et cetera that is all out there for you<br /><br />Then after that, it’s making certain you get a strong body of people around you that are going to support you through the difficult times. Most people will have a family and then when you’re in the football club itself, you want people around you who are really prepared to help you, not necessarily always telling you the things you want to hear, but helping you in the sense that they see the pitfalls and where the danger is coming from and they alert you to help you head it off.<br /><br />I was fortunate that I got the opportunity to go abroad when I was quite young which I suppose to a certain extent, short circuited my career. If I had started as a youth team coach somewhere, it can take a long time for someone to gain the real opportunities to go in and take a group of senior players in a serious football league<br /><br />I was quite lucky that I short-circuited that process by going to Sweden and it’s certainly something I’ve never regretted so I would also put that point in there that as a young coach, you may have to be bold and courageous in some ways to take that opportunity to try and cut your teeth somewhere else other than England</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson ‘feared the worst’ after <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> blow]</b> It was a very good performance. One feared the worst when we lost <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> but the players overcame that unbelievable piece of bad luck to play well in that half. It would’ve been asking a lot for them to stop and people react instinctively. They were behind the defence and they carried on and took it. It would’ve been unrealistic to suggest they do otherwise. In the end, it cost us a point, because they won by one goal. To come back from 2-0 was a really good effort and I can’t fault the players. On another day, we might have taken something from the game. While ultimately it’s another defeat, I hope the players will remember what a good performance they put in. The way we approached the game towards the end, hitting the inside of the post, I’m not sure the fans could’ve added anything more were they here but we gave it our all</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson rubbishes suggestion <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> are ‘on their holidays’]</b> I certainly don’t have any fears about the players to keep going and give their level best in the rest of the games. I haven’t been disappointed with the way the team has performed during these <b>[post-lockdown]</b> games. There have been moments when we’ve done well, in particular the other night when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> knew they’d been very much in a game and were quite fortunate to get away with all three points. We’ll be trying to get as many points as we possibly can in these last four games. It’s not going to be easy but it will be important to break the losing sequence<br /><br />I’m very disappointed to lose <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a>. It couldn’t have happened for us at a worse point in the game, and it couldn’t have happened to a better person in terms of what he’s done for us this season. Losing him is an enormous blow and let’s hope he recovers for the start of next season. We’ve found ourselves having to play some really difficult games. But I thought it was a really good performance from the players against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and had Gary not suffered that injury they probably would have not gone 1-0 up in the game. We would be sitting here otherwise saying we were good value for 2-2, especially as we hit the inside of the post in the last minute.<br /><br /><b>[On the test that he expects from relegation-threatened Villa opponents, who are desperate for points]</b> Most teams in their position will be looking to come out fighting. It’s not their last chance, but if they don’t win that one they will be staring down the barrel of a gun. So we do expect them to come out with all guns blazing</p>

  <p><b>[Palace manager Roy Hodgson said he supported <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>’s decision to go public about the abuse]</b> It is very saddening on the day of a game that a player wakes up to this cowardly and despicable abuse.

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha: Roy Hodgson says <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> winger has ‘character and desire’ to fight racism]</b> Has Wilf got the character and desire to step forward in the same way <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> has and shown himself to be someone prepared to stand out there and stand up for the rights that all people should have and to fight injustice? My answer would be yes. He is strong enough to do it but how he can do it and what he can do and what change he can bring about I really don’t know. The bottom line is these things are still happening and players are still being abused in this way. It affects their mental welfare. For Wilf to receive this on the day of the game and to be expected to go out and perform and to forget about it is asking something that isn’t humanly possible. The brain and the mind doesn’t function in that way<br /><br /><b>[when asked if he was considering resting <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>]</b> What a sad day that would be though. Then I am putting myself in a position to tell him what is good for him and not good for him. All I can do really is to offer him the option that if you do not feel ready to play and mentally ready because this abuse has hurt so much then I understand that and I am prepared to leave you out. It would, at the end of the day, have to be a decision he would have to make because when he tells me, ‘no I am ready to play and I want to play’ I don’t have any option but to take that at face value, knowing full well it would have been better for all concerned had the abuse had not happened. Unfortunately I can’t guarantee he can get those things out of his mind however hard he tries</p>

I find that toing and froing pretty meaningless. It wasn’t a penalty as the referee didn’t give it and the VAR didn’t overturn it. And we feel hard done by again but there are no points for feeling hard done by. We’re not fortunate at the moment. The gods of fortune aren’t smiling on us. Firstly with certain decisions, but they’re not smiling on us as we’re doing so well in so many areas and we’re not getting rewards for the efforts. My feelings go out to the players as they couldn’t have done more. We’ve won games against top teams like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> playing a lot worse than we did tonight</p>
