Let’s keep our priorities right and work hard to stay in this league. Then I’m pretty sure we would be saying to Ruben, is it worth having the conversation with Chelsea, could you consider? Then of course the conversation with Chelsea will come around and we will see from there. There’s no doubt he is going to be hot property if he has four more games like the last couple.

I suppose a lot will depend on what offers come to the club and the only thing I can say with real certainty is that nobody at the club, in particular myself and my coaching staff and the other players, want him to leave, obviously not.<br /><br />I have heard him say in interviews that he felt he was too young going to Manchester United and wasn’t ready to handle the pressures of what being at Manchester United meant. I am pretty sure he has matured and that is no longer the case that he lacks maturity, and the other thing is that if he believes in this club and the work that we are doing, you sometimes can’t do a lot better than where you are. What I do know is that someone like Wilf, if their head does ever get turned, it won’t be because there is more money involved</p>

But I understand that wasn’t the case and it was a pretty even game up there and Bournemouth played well enough but were on the end of a bad result.

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson thinks Wayne Rooney left England too early]</b> He left England too early. He still has much to offer. There is no doubt the talent he has, showing he could still play top-level English football. But it was his decision and after Manchester United and Everton, where he had tremendous affinity, deep roots, maybe he would not have been that interested in playing for another English club outside those two. It was a conscious decision to play abroad. I have a great deal of respect for Wayne, and I think he does for me.<br /><br />I would have loved him here at Palace, but he thought long and hard about his decision, and without a shadow of doubt would have talked it over with his family. I am delighted to see what success he is having. I guess he is doing what DC United were really hoping for when they signed him. They just didn’t want a figurehead but also a player who can win them matches, and he has done that. He is doing fantastically well. At DC they were well down in the league when he got there, although they hadn’t played too many games, but since he’s arrived he has been fantastic, not just scoring goals, but decisive goals, like the one we saw in midweek</p>

If Aaron gets selected for the first national team, we’ll be really pleased, of course, but I don’t intend to put any - pressure’s the wrong word - I don’t intend to make any suggestions to him in that respect. I work on the basis that he <b>[Southgate]</b> knows Aaron, he knows the other players that are competing for that place too and he’ll make the decision which suits him.<br /><br />Basically speaking he’s been a very important part of Aidy Boothroyd’s Under-21 team for at least a couple of seasons now and has been one of the cogs which has enabled that team to qualify for the World Cup and take part this summer, something which he is really looking forward to. He’s a very, very good player. He’s already played for his country, he’s already played for England. If Aaron was to be selected for the senior team we’d be delighted but we’re equally delighted that he’s doing so well for the Under-21s. Whichever way for us, it’s a win situation</p>

I can’t say that I am surprised <b>[about reported interest]</b>, I think he is playing so well and he has an incredible future in front of him.

We’re so lucky in this country to have a system like it, I’ve always felt that we do have a fantastic service and now it’s being demonstrated to everyone so clearly, that the resources we put in are well spent. I hope it might in future make us more aware that if you want this level of service, it needs a certain level of economic support - and I’m hopeful it will come from our taxes. We can’t rely on the NHS being funded by charities or people making donations - it’s nice that such individuals and organisations are doing so, and I’m full of praise for those who are doing it - but the work they’re doing is quite incredible and needs adequate resourcing. The praise they’re getting however enormous it is, will never be enough.<br /><br />Everyone is in total agreement we need an end to this season. We don’t want artificial means of deciding who wins the league, who gets into the Champions League, who gets relegated and promoted. Ideally our players would have three or four weeks’ minimum to prepare for the first match back, but I accept there may have to be a squeeze on that timeframe. It might mean extra restrictions at our place of work - the training ground - for example. It may also mean that we have to play our nine remaining matches in a shorter period of time than we normally would have done, and subsequently receive a shorter break between the seasons. But I think with all of these sacrifices - and I am uncomfortable using that word in such a context - everyone will be more than happy to go along with what it takes in order to get playing again as soon as possible in order to get the season finished</p>

  <p><b>[By Roy Hodgson’s own admission, the safety of another season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been a welcome relief for <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> in the most disjointed of seasons]</b> <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> has always been a club very dear to me and you never forget your boyhood team and the team you supported from the terraces first of all, that’s always going to stay with you. Of course, it’s a club I think has potential too. We’re finding that it’s always a battle to stay in the league, but less of a battle this year and perhaps even less of a battle last year than the one previous to that. We need to work that little bit harder to make sure our squad is strong enough to make certain that every year, there’s not going to be a question of ‘are we going to stay in the league’, it’s going to be more of a question of ‘how high can we get? Can we make certain we finish in the top half rather than the bottom?’<br /><br />That’s the next challenge for the club. That’s the next step forward that I like to think we can take and it would be nice to be a part of that just like it’s been nice to be a part of the last three seasons, albeit the first two of them were a little bit hair-raising at times because it was all about looking over your shoulders and worry that you were going to be sucked into that dreaded relegation zone.<br /><br />We had a very good spell of four straight wins, which is fantastic and took us into a really good position. That lifted us up into a very comfortable mid-table position and a top 10 position at that moment in time. We always knew there were some very tough games coming up to get through in the last eight, as it would have been then, and there was a risk that you wouldn’t necessarily keep that run of victories going<br /><br />We’ve got to keep our sense of perspective and most importantly of all, we’ve got to be more than satisfied with the season the club has had and what these players have done for the club. My previous two seasons with the club has been a fight against relegation from the first moment to the last and on this occasion, we found ourselves in the situation with nine games to play, free of relegation worries and it is testament to the excellent work the players did to get us into that position<br /><br />Are we satisfied with it? No, of course we’re not. We would like to win every game, but we also know we have our work cut out because teams like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> - who are all coming here - will have a lot to play for and have a lot of quality in their team and will be asking many questions of us<br /><br />I think we’ve found <b>[the restart]</b> very hard as we always knew we would because we have a situation where the average age of our squad is quite high - it’s the highest in the league - and we don’t have a very big squad<br /><br />We don’t have an awful lot of players, we’ve still got three senior players out injured and the size of our squad didn’t really allow for that. We really need a full week of preparation and a full week of recovery, but we always knew that wasn’t going to happen so it’s not a complaint, it’s just an explanation about why we have found it a bit harder<br /><br />We will continue to find it hard, not least of all because the remaining games were going to be very tough but fortunately, we were able to use the previous 29 to get ourselves into a good position<br /><br />The only game really we can look at and say we were disappointed that we didn’t do a lot better was the <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> game but credit to them, they came here and played well, we had our chances in the second half to equalise but we didn’t take them<br /><br />Against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, I thought the performance was more than satisfactory and the result wasn’t actually a true reflection of the game. We paid for the mistakes we made and they defended well and they won the game and deservedly so because they got the goals. But it wasn’t a question of being bitterly disappointed with the teams performance, I think you’ve always got to look at the form and the results<br /><br />Sometimes you get results that don’t necessarily reflect the way the game has gone and when they go in your favour, you tend to dismiss the good fortune or dismiss the things that weren’t that good and you got away with. Conversely, when you lose a game, you tend to dismiss a lot of the things that were quite good and concentrate on the fact that some things didn’t go so well and you lost the game<br /><br /><b>[Facing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Their intelligence, their understanding of the game, their interest tactically, they were definitely the thinking man’s player. When you get a player like that, it’s hardly surprising if he wants to <b>[become a manager]</b> because these days, there are very good players who probably do have the potential, they go down a different route in football<br /><br />With management, every week you’re being judged and criticised and it puts your reputation and body on the line every week. I’m really glad Frank chose to do it and Steven as well and I certainly didn’t have any doubts that if they chose to go down that route, they would be big successes, not only because of their knowledge, but also their personalities and their interest and depth of knowledge about the game<br /><br />They were always bound to be thinking coaches and managers too so it’s nice to see both of them getting the chance in their first jobs at a very good level. It seems to be that both clubs have got behind their choice, they believed in their choice and rightly so. As a result, they’re reaping the rewards<br /><br />I thought <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were looking good before the break and they’ve come back and continued that. They’re a very good team with many good players and irrespective of our own position at this moment in time, it would have been a very difficult game to play in<br /><br />All we can do is prepare for it and look forward to it, I know we will do our best and work very hard to try and make life as difficult for them as possible but we are 100 per cent aware of the challenges which are going to be presented to us with the quality they have<br /><br />It’s a bit dangerous giving advice but you’ve got to really want to do it. I don’t think you should go into coaching on management unless you really believe this is something you want to do. You’ve got to be prepared that it won’t be all sunshine and roses, there’s going to be plenty of difficult moments. The really good moments you find sometimes get cancelled out by the doom and gloom, that’s going to be part of your life however successful you are. You’ve got to come to terms with that so you have to have quite a strong constitution<br /><br />Then I think you’ve got to be prepared to do the relevant amount of studying. These days, it’s not just a question of hanging up your boots after being a good player and going straight into the manager’s office the next day and dictating what training is going to be like, you’ve got to go through all the preparations with your coaching badges and you even need to do management diplomas. You need to get yourself onto those courses and there are a lot of leadership seminars et cetera that is all out there for you<br /><br />Then after that, it’s making certain you get a strong body of people around you that are going to support you through the difficult times. Most people will have a family and then when you’re in the football club itself, you want people around you who are really prepared to help you, not necessarily always telling you the things you want to hear, but helping you in the sense that they see the pitfalls and where the danger is coming from and they alert you to help you head it off.<br /><br />I was fortunate that I got the opportunity to go abroad when I was quite young which I suppose to a certain extent, short circuited my career. If I had started as a youth team coach somewhere, it can take a long time for someone to gain the real opportunities to go in and take a group of senior players in a serious football league<br /><br />I was quite lucky that I short-circuited that process by going to Sweden and it’s certainly something I’ve never regretted so I would also put that point in there that as a young coach, you may have to be bold and courageous in some ways to take that opportunity to try and cut your teeth somewhere else other than England</p>

The bottom line is these things are still happening and players are still being abused in this way. It affects their mental welfare. For Wilf to receive this on the day of the game and to be expected to go out and perform and to forget about it is asking something that isn’t humanly possible. The brain and the mind doesn’t function in that way<br /><br /><b>[when asked if he was considering resting <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>]</b> What a sad day that would be though. Then I am putting myself in a position to tell him what is good for him and not good for him. All I can do really is to offer him the option that if you do not feel ready to play and mentally ready because this abuse has hurt so much then I understand that and I am prepared to leave you out. It would, at the end of the day, have to be a decision he would have to make because when he tells me, ‘no I am ready to play and I want to play’ I don’t have any option but to take that at face value, knowing full well it would have been better for all concerned had the abuse had not happened. Unfortunately I can’t guarantee he can get those things out of his mind however hard he tries</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson took a measured view regarding the <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> decision, saying everyone will have different opinions but did feel his team had been hard done by]</b> You’re always going to believe that when decisions go against you like that, they’re wrong but I’m sure Ole has said the decision is right. I find that toing and froing pretty meaningless. It wasn’t a penalty as the referee didn’t give it and the VAR didn’t overturn it. And we feel hard done by again but there are no points for feeling hard done by. We’re not fortunate at the moment. The gods of fortune aren’t smiling on us. Firstly with certain decisions, but they’re not smiling on us as we’re doing so well in so many areas and we’re not getting rewards for the efforts. My feelings go out to the players as they couldn’t have done more. We’ve won games against top teams like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> playing a lot worse than we did tonight</p>
