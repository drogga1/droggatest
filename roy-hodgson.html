He’s a little bit rusty, of course when a player comes back from three weeks away he’s going to need a bit of time to find his true form.

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has admitted the club expects more from <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a>]</b> Very few people in our teams have scored goals, we’ve only scored three so it is quite easy to remember who the goalscorers were. As for assists it is only three possible assists, so it is probably a little unkind to start saying. ‘You are not assisting enough or scoring enough’. I would say that we expect a lot more from Wilf in terms of assists and goals and I think that we are going to get it.<br /><br /><b>[Hodgson has praised the attitude of the Ivory Coast international since his failed summer transfer move but insisted the club needs him]</b> His attitude in training and the way he has approached the games, especially the last three games, he has been very good after he came over the initial disappointment that he didn’t get his way in the transfer window. Once he got over that and came to terms with the fact, now he has got to buckle down, for his club and his team-mates, manager, coaching staff and for himself, I think he has been very good. I have actually been very pleased with him in the last three games, but I can’t deny the fact he hasn’t had an assist or a goal</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson has hailed <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>’s development on and off the pitch]</b> He was always a fantastic midfielder, a very hard worker, made good runs most of the time. I remember in Switzerland, he played in behind the front players, like he was for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and he was quite outstanding. The criticism levelled at him was much to my displeasure and the attention he was getting elsewhere from social media and sometimes the media itself was draining his confidence.<br /><br />I think the big thing for Raheem is there is no drain in his confidence, there is no doubt about his ability. Of course, he is playing in a team that is creating lots of chances so when he gets in the right areas he is able to score goals. On this subject too, I must add that his maturity as a person has been really fascinating to watch. All of the responsibility he has accepted and not just as a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> player but shouldering a heavy burden with the racism and the attention that is being paid to this racism problem that we have.

We can’t rely on the NHS being funded by charities or people making donations - it’s nice that such individuals and organisations are doing so, and I’m full of praise for those who are doing it - but the work they’re doing is quite incredible and needs adequate resourcing.

  <p><b>[By Roy Hodgson’s own admission, the safety of another season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been a welcome relief for Crystal Palace in the most disjointed of seasons]</b> Crystal Palace has always been a club very dear to me and you never forget your boyhood team and the team you supported from the terraces first of all, that’s always going to stay with you. Of course, it’s a club I think has potential too. We’re finding that it’s always a battle to stay in the league, but less of a battle this year and perhaps even less of a battle last year than the one previous to that. We need to work that little bit harder to make sure our squad is strong enough to make certain that every year, there’s not going to be a question of ‘are we going to stay in the league’, it’s going to be more of a question of ‘how high can we get? Can we make certain we finish in the top half rather than the bottom?’<br /><br />That’s the next challenge for the club. That’s the next step forward that I like to think we can take and it would be nice to be a part of that just like it’s been nice to be a part of the last three seasons, albeit the first two of them were a little bit hair-raising at times because it was all about looking over your shoulders and worry that you were going to be sucked into that dreaded relegation zone.<br /><br />We had a very good spell of four straight wins, which is fantastic and took us into a really good position. That lifted us up into a very comfortable mid-table position and a top 10 position at that moment in time. We always knew there were some very tough games coming up to get through in the last eight, as it would have been then, and there was a risk that you wouldn’t necessarily keep that run of victories going<br /><br />We’ve got to keep our sense of perspective and most importantly of all, we’ve got to be more than satisfied with the season the club has had and what these players have done for the club. My previous two seasons with the club has been a fight against relegation from the first moment to the last and on this occasion, we found ourselves in the situation with nine games to play, free of relegation worries and it is testament to the excellent work the players did to get us into that position<br /><br />Are we satisfied with it? No, of course we’re not. We would like to win every game, but we also know we have our work cut out because teams like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> - who are all coming here - will have a lot to play for and have a lot of quality in their team and will be asking many questions of us<br /><br />I think we’ve found <b>[the restart]</b> very hard as we always knew we would because we have a situation where the average age of our squad is quite high - it’s the highest in the league - and we don’t have a very big squad<br /><br />We don’t have an awful lot of players, we’ve still got three senior players out injured and the size of our squad didn’t really allow for that. We really need a full week of preparation and a full week of recovery, but we always knew that wasn’t going to happen so it’s not a complaint, it’s just an explanation about why we have found it a bit harder<br /><br />We will continue to find it hard, not least of all because the remaining games were going to be very tough but fortunately, we were able to use the previous 29 to get ourselves into a good position<br /><br />The only game really we can look at and say we were disappointed that we didn’t do a lot better was the <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> game but credit to them, they came here and played well, we had our chances in the second half to equalise but we didn’t take them<br /><br />Against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, I thought the performance was more than satisfactory and the result wasn’t actually a true reflection of the game. We paid for the mistakes we made and they defended well and they won the game and deservedly so because they got the goals. But it wasn’t a question of being bitterly disappointed with the teams performance, I think you’ve always got to look at the form and the results<br /><br />Sometimes you get results that don’t necessarily reflect the way the game has gone and when they go in your favour, you tend to dismiss the good fortune or dismiss the things that weren’t that good and you got away with. Conversely, when you lose a game, you tend to dismiss a lot of the things that were quite good and concentrate on the fact that some things didn’t go so well and you lost the game<br /><br /><b>[Facing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and Chelsea]</b> Their intelligence, their understanding of the game, their interest tactically, they were definitely the thinking man’s player. When you get a player like that, it’s hardly surprising if he wants to <b>[become a manager]</b> because these days, there are very good players who probably do have the potential, they go down a different route in football<br /><br />With management, every week you’re being judged and criticised and it puts your reputation and body on the line every week. I’m really glad Frank chose to do it and Steven as well and I certainly didn’t have any doubts that if they chose to go down that route, they would be big successes, not only because of their knowledge, but also their personalities and their interest and depth of knowledge about the game<br /><br />They were always bound to be thinking coaches and managers too so it’s nice to see both of them getting the chance in their first jobs at a very good level. It seems to be that both clubs have got behind their choice, they believed in their choice and rightly so. As a result, they’re reaping the rewards<br /><br />I thought <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were looking good before the break and they’ve come back and continued that. They’re a very good team with many good players and irrespective of our own position at this moment in time, it would have been a very difficult game to play in<br /><br />All we can do is prepare for it and look forward to it, I know we will do our best and work very hard to try and make life as difficult for them as possible but we are 100 per cent aware of the challenges which are going to be presented to us with the quality they have<br /><br />It’s a bit dangerous giving advice but you’ve got to really want to do it. I don’t think you should go into coaching on management unless you really believe this is something you want to do. You’ve got to be prepared that it won’t be all sunshine and roses, there’s going to be plenty of difficult moments. The really good moments you find sometimes get cancelled out by the doom and gloom, that’s going to be part of your life however successful you are. You’ve got to come to terms with that so you have to have quite a strong constitution<br /><br />Then I think you’ve got to be prepared to do the relevant amount of studying. These days, it’s not just a question of hanging up your boots after being a good player and going straight into the manager’s office the next day and dictating what training is going to be like, you’ve got to go through all the preparations with your coaching badges and you even need to do management diplomas. You need to get yourself onto those courses and there are a lot of leadership seminars et cetera that is all out there for you<br /><br />Then after that, it’s making certain you get a strong body of people around you that are going to support you through the difficult times. Most people will have a family and then when you’re in the football club itself, you want people around you who are really prepared to help you, not necessarily always telling you the things you want to hear, but helping you in the sense that they see the pitfalls and where the danger is coming from and they alert you to help you head it off.<br /><br />I was fortunate that I got the opportunity to go abroad when I was quite young which I suppose to a certain extent, short circuited my career. If I had started as a youth team coach somewhere, it can take a long time for someone to gain the real opportunities to go in and take a group of senior players in a serious football league<br /><br />I was quite lucky that I short-circuited that process by going to Sweden and it’s certainly something I’ve never regretted so I would also put that point in there that as a young coach, you may have to be bold and courageous in some ways to take that opportunity to try and cut your teeth somewhere else other than England</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson ‘feared the worst’ after Cahill blow]</b> It was a very good performance. One feared the worst when we lost <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> but the players overcame that unbelievable piece of bad luck to play well in that half. It would’ve been asking a lot for them to stop and people react instinctively. They were behind the defence and they carried on and took it. It would’ve been unrealistic to suggest they do otherwise. In the end, it cost us a point, because they won by one goal. To come back from 2-0 was a really good effort and I can’t fault the players. On another day, we might have taken something from the game. While ultimately it’s another defeat, I hope the players will remember what a good performance they put in. The way we approached the game towards the end, hitting the inside of the post, I’m not sure the fans could’ve added anything more were they here but we gave it our all</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Hodgson rubbishes suggestion Crystal Palace are ‘on their holidays’]</b> I certainly don’t have any fears about the players to keep going and give their level best in the rest of the games. I haven’t been disappointed with the way the team has performed during these <b>[post-lockdown]</b> games. There have been moments when we’ve done well, in particular the other night when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> knew they’d been very much in a game and were quite fortunate to get away with all three points. We’ll be trying to get as many points as we possibly can in these last four games. It’s not going to be easy but it will be important to break the losing sequence<br /><br />I’m very disappointed to lose <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a>. It couldn’t have happened for us at a worse point in the game, and it couldn’t have happened to a better person in terms of what he’s done for us this season. Losing him is an enormous blow and let’s hope he recovers for the start of next season. We’ve found ourselves having to play some really difficult games. But I thought it was a really good performance from the players against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and had Gary not suffered that injury they probably would have not gone 1-0 up in the game. We would be sitting here otherwise saying we were good value for 2-2, especially as we hit the inside of the post in the last minute.<br /><br /><b>[On the test that he expects from relegation-threatened Villa opponents, who are desperate for points]</b> Most teams in their position will be looking to come out fighting. It’s not their last chance, but if they don’t win that one they will be staring down the barrel of a gun. So we do expect them to come out with all guns blazing</p>

There was a lot of niggling going on on the field, we’re close enough to be aware of that, but the thing is that is part and parcel of the game we play. It is quite often present in a lot of football matches. And you must not allow it to provoke you into doing something that is going to stop you playing for the rest of the season.

  <p><b>[Palace manager Roy Hodgson said he supported <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>’s decision to go public about the abuse]</b> It is very saddening on the day of a game that a player wakes up to this cowardly and despicable abuse.

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha: Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace winger has ‘character and desire’ to fight racism]</b> Has Wilf got the character and desire to step forward in the same way <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> has and shown himself to be someone prepared to stand out there and stand up for the rights that all people should have and to fight injustice? My answer would be yes. He is strong enough to do it but how he can do it and what he can do and what change he can bring about I really don’t know. The bottom line is these things are still happening and players are still being abused in this way. It affects their mental welfare. For Wilf to receive this on the day of the game and to be expected to go out and perform and to forget about it is asking something that isn’t humanly possible. The brain and the mind doesn’t function in that way<br /><br /><b>[when asked if he was considering resting <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>]</b> What a sad day that would be though. Then I am putting myself in a position to tell him what is good for him and not good for him. All I can do really is to offer him the option that if you do not feel ready to play and mentally ready because this abuse has hurt so much then I understand that and I am prepared to leave you out. It would, at the end of the day, have to be a decision he would have to make because when he tells me, ‘no I am ready to play and I want to play’ I don’t have any option but to take that at face value, knowing full well it would have been better for all concerned had the abuse had not happened. Unfortunately I can’t guarantee he can get those things out of his mind however hard he tries</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson took a measured view regarding the <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> decision, saying everyone will have different opinions but did feel his team had been hard done by]</b> You’re always going to believe that when decisions go against you like that, they’re wrong but I’m sure Ole has said the decision is right. I find that toing and froing pretty meaningless. It wasn’t a penalty as the referee didn’t give it and the VAR didn’t overturn it. And we feel hard done by again but there are no points for feeling hard done by. We’re not fortunate at the moment. The gods of fortune aren’t smiling on us. Firstly with certain decisions, but they’re not smiling on us as we’re doing so well in so many areas and we’re not getting rewards for the efforts. My feelings go out to the players as they couldn’t have done more. We’ve won games against top teams like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> playing a lot worse than we did tonight</p>
