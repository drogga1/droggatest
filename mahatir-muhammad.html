  <p><b>[The peace process in southern Thailand is going on well under former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Tan Sri <a href="abdul-rahim-noor.html">Abdul Rahim Noor</a>, but these issues cannot be solved overnight]</b> I am satisfied with his performance (as the facilitator for the southern Thailand peace talks). There are many factions in southern Thailand and this misunderstanding cannot be solved overnight<br /><br /><b>[On another note, Dr Mahathir lamented that people do not give due recognition to Asean though it’s the only regional organisation that has always been able to solve conflicts among its members peacefully]</b> In Asean, we are able to solve (our problems) in a peaceful manner. We don’t have problems such as those in North Africa, Europe and the Middle East</p>

  <p><b>[After the Crown Prince of Johor Tunku Idris Ibrahim was filmed saying in a video that the Prime Minister Mahatir Muhammad should be changed]</b> He thinks he is someone big, but he is just a small fry. If he thinks he’s big, go and vote and bring me down<br /><br /><b>[Separately, Dr Mahathir said he will try not to allow the country to flounder and fall, to lose dignity and sense of purpose, for as long as he lives]</b> For as long as I live, I will try not to allow this nation of ours to flounder and fall, to lose dignity and sense of purpose. We have prevailed in the past and we will hopefully prevail now and, in the future<br /><br /><b>[He also stressed the need to find common ground and purpose to unite the country]</b> Since I was the Prime Minister in the first round, I was frequently asked what were my secrets for being able to manage a nation which is so diverse that almost each segment has a different set of demands and priorities<br /><br />There are no secrets other than the most basic and logical concepts when we are dealing with a diverse group of people. Once we established the common grounds and purposes, we can build on them</p>

  <p><b>[when asked if he sought to purchase new Russian aircraft]</b> These are very expensive toys. Spending money on expensive fighter planes is not very productive for us. We’re not going to war with anyone, but of course we have to keep up the level of technology in our own defense forces<br /><br /><b>[Mahathir told he wanted the downed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 investigated by a neutral body]</b> I am not doubting <b>[Joint Investigation Team (JIT)’s]</b> truthfulness. But there are certain things that they claim <b>[that are]</b> difficult for us to accept, particularly the identification of the people who actually fired the missile. That is very difficult for anybody to determine … <b>[During his recent interview with Sputnik, Mahathir claimed that Dutch authorities]</b> were the ones who actually opened up the recordings and read the recordings. We were not together with them when they were doing this</p>
