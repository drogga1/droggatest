<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Swedish side Osters promise to stamp out cheating]</b> It’s nothing we’ve decided overnight, but it was brought up by the context of the Barcelona match. Although we live in different worlds, this is not the kind of football we stand for. We do not want to win in such a way. We believe that it is possible to make football better than it is today. We won’t sit as a court and examine every 50/50 situation, but we could at least start with the obvious cheating? If someone falls down and pretends to be injured even though the entire crowd and all cameras show there was no contact, for example.<br /><br />We want to make a difference, and we are ready to act against our players. We believe that we as a club can have an influence and that our work will also put pressure on more teams to take a position<br /><br />I’ve been thinking about this for many years. Why are there no big clubs to take action? Take Real Madrid, who can choose exactly which players they want. Pepe’s the biggest pig in the world - why is he still there? He does things that the world thinks is wrong, debases the brand, costs a lot of money. I don’t understand it. This is not a way for us to generate publicity or to look good in the eyes of the world, but actually make a difference</p>
