  <p><b>[Idrissa Gueye has not given up hope of joining Paris Saint-Germain after Everton rejected two bids for him in January]</b> It is a dream that sadly did not come true. Every player works to join the best teams, to play in such matches in the Champions League,” he told L’Equipe. “But I was honoured that PSG were interested in me. Now, I know that I am of interest to that type of club, that I am ready to go to the final level to join a top European club. I am going to work even more so that they come back for me. Maybe it is not finished with PSG. I was ready for PSG, so I am disappointed, but I also see that the work pays off. I grew up at the academy at Diambars in Senegal, I came to Lille, then I went to the Premier League with Aston Villa. Then, a notch above to Everton. All of this is linear. I built myself, PSG embodied the last great step that I’m missing.<br /><br />There was an information session with my entourage at the end of 2018. The contacts accelerated when the transfer window opened. PSG asked my agents to find out how I could get out, but Everton put the brakes on immediately, they did not want to sell me. I pushed, I met the club leaders to tell them of my desire to go to PSG. It was a golden opportunity, a huge challenge not to be missed at 29 years old. PSG came back to me and then Thomas Tuchel called me. There were two <b>[bids]</b>, the last one just at the end of the transfer window. I put the pressure back on Everton, I told them again that I wanted to go, it was also a very good offer, Everton bought me for £7m from Aston Villa in August 2016. Two and a half years later, I could get them nearly four times as much back. I could certainly come back to France, my second country after Senegal. Part of my family lives there, I have a lot of friends too</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> have completed the signing of <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye, with the fee reported to be £28 million]</b> I’m immensely proud to sign for <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. After focussing on the AFCON with Senegal, I wanted to give a new boost to my club career by joining <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in Europe. I’d like to thank the directors, the coach and his staff for the confidence they have shown in me. I will do everything to justify the faith they have shown in me and to integrate into this talented squad. And of course I can’t wait to take in the amazing atmosphere of the <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>, which impressed me during my first seasons in France!</p>

He does what he wants. He can do anything with the ball and he’s unstoppable. He’s a good person and I think when he came back from injury he spoke to make things clear. He helps us to win and despite all that was said he’s been focused. He’s had to be very strong to come through all that he lived through</p>

  <p><b>[Idrissa Gueye is giving little credence to talk of a move away from <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, where he has enjoyed a fine first season]</b> I’m used to these rumours. For each transfer window, it’s like that for me. Even in January, six months after I arrived at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I was already linked to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, so I’m used to it. Everything is going well for me at the club, and I am often in contact with the sporting director <b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>]</b> and there was never any question of a departure. He never spoke to me about transfers or letting me go. So, to me, these are just rumours in the transfer market because there isn’t much happening at the moment<br /><br />Once we have resumed training, we must be ready to resume immediately and fight to go as far as possible, even if we are a little disadvantaged by the fact that the other leagues have resumed for some time. They will have had a lot more competition than us, but if we try to turn that into our favour, that is to say not to ask questions, to say the others have started again and not us, we can turn that on our side. <b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> can]</b> tell ourselves that we will arrive much fresher than the others because they will have played a lot of games, and that we will be fresher to put them in difficulty and win as many games as possible</p>
