  <p><b>[Llorente wanted to remain at Juve]</b> I was sorry to leave Juve, in Turin I was happy. If it was up to me and I felt the trust, I would have stayed. Clubs like Juve are few in the world. I do not feel inferior to Mandzukic, although we are talking about a great centre forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham striker Fernando Llorente is preparing for a Champions League reunion with Juventus]</b> Juve is a difficult place to leave. I left the Vinovo training ground crying. It’s also true what <b>[former Juventus striker]</b> David Trezeguet said: ‘It’s only when you leave Juventus that you realise what you had’. I miss it like crazy and would love to return. It’s a special club because, despite being an enormous club, it’s like a family inside. There is a fine image of Juventus here and I raise it even more. I always speak very highly of the Bianconeri and give them a good rep.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would be an impressive signing for Barcelona]</b> Why not? He is a huge footballer and still has a lot to offer. He is one of the best in his position and would be in one of the best teams in the world. Despite the noise which surrounds him, he is a great professional. I know him well from the two years that we shared in Turin and we have a very good relationship. It would be an impressive signing for Barca.<br /><br />For a large part of my career I have had continuity and confidence <b>[thanks to playing regularly]</b>, but now I have to get used to this new reality. It is not easy. It is a daily struggle with yourself because it is hard to accept the situation you live in. When you’re left on the sidelines or you are not called upon it is frustrating. But I try to continue training every day with maximum <b>[energy]</b> for when my opportunity comes. Giving up is not an option<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on his plans for possible free agency]</b> I have not thought about anything yet. I’m focused on my work at Tottenham and I do not want to look any further. I will try to get more minutes and get better every day. Back to Athletic? It is one of the options. With family in mind I would like to continue in Europe but we will see what offers there are when the season ends. I could continue in the Premier League, return to Spain or even Italy, where I was very happy. I would happily go back there</p>

I hope I continue to have opportunities, it’s important for me because it gives me the confidence to keep working, it’s not easy when you do not play because mentally you have to be very strong to continue training hard</p>

If I have the opportunity and can talk to them, for me, yes, I would like to go back.<br /><br />Leaving in the winter market does not depend on me, Athletic would have to talk to Tottenham and Levy</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham striker Fernando Llorente has said his dramatic late winner against Watford on Wednesday could prove to be a huge goal]</b> It was difficult because I had a big chance, normally, in 10 chances <b>[like that]</b> I’d score nine but sometimes the ball doesn’t want to go in. In that moment, you have to forget that chance, keep fighting, believe, always believe in the team, believe we can win and in the last minute I had an amazing chance and this time, I scored. This goal is very important for me. It gives me confidence to keep fighting, to keep running, to be stronger every game.<br /><br /><b>[Spurs have been criticised for their supposed mental weaknesses]</b> We suffered a lot. Watford created a lot of problems for us with their goal from the corner. We were strong, strong mentally, because after the two defeats in the cups this wasn’t easy. We played well in the second half. We were 1-0 down but I think we’re a very strong team because we played really well in a difficult situation. I’m really happy to help the team<br /><br /><b>[The 2-1 win]</b> It’s a massive result, a massive win. At that moment <b>[when I scored]</b>, it was very special - and after all that running, I was really tired! We ran a lot, we were aggressive, we played well</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Llorente turned down an offer to leave Tottenham during the January transfer window]</b> I haven’t had a phone call from Bilbao, but I did get a call from another club in Spain… but not a club from the south. If I renew for one year I’ll be delighted. The project here at Tottenham is very exciting, but we are also prepared for any phone call that might come through<br /><br />I don’t know anything. The truth is I’m very satisfied here in Spurs, I haven’t thought about leaving. I’m at a great club, I still have a contract, and my intention is to win trophies here. Right now, I’m enjoying a good moment, and I hope I can keep scoring goals and everything keeps going well.<br /><br />To be honest, I was dreaming of that goal. This season and last season, I was on the bench a lot of the time, and always I tried to score. It had been a while since I’d come off the bench to score, so it was satisfying, and all the more so that it was Champions League. The important thing is to help whenever I’m called upon, and keep working hard</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Llorente believes the decision to award his decisive goal for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> was the right one]</b> I feel that, a little bit, touching the hand but the hand is near the ball, you know. I didn’t see the ball. I didn’t try to hit the ball with the hand and I think it has to be a goal, but you never know in this moment. I’m very proud because it’s not easy. Coming in the game in this unbelievable game with a lot of pressure, in a difficult moment as well but I always believe in me, in my opportunities. This is what I do</p>

  <p><b>[Llorente expects Ajax response from Tottenham after West Ham wake-up call]</b> Maybe it’s better, no? It’s right, we need everyone to wake up because if we play like this on Tuesday we will lose, easy. This kind of game <b>[the semi-final]</b> doesn’t need to be prepared for because the mentality of all the players will be different. But I don’t think I can understand why the mentality of the team wasn’t ready to play against West Ham. I don’t know <b>[why]</b> but I told you, if we play like that against Ajax then for sure we will lose<br /><br />I always think each one can be the last one. For this thing I will fight as if it is the last time. For me it’s unbelievable. It’s an amazing opportunity to give my best to help the team, to demonstrate I can help the team and I will try to do my best</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> striker Fernando Llorente has confessed that he ‘struggles’ to accept playing second fiddle to <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> in <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s squad.]</b> It’s something you have to adapt to. I am at a great club with incredible players, and in the end, the manager has to make decisions, because only 11 players can play. It’s not easy for him and, with players of that quality, it’s not easy to get into the team. Internally, it’s a struggle. Because in the end what all players want is to play every Sunday, so every time you don’t, it’s a disappointment. But that’s also where you learn to be mentally strong and say, ‘Okay, I’m not playing but I have to keep working hard every day and I have to be ready every when the opportunity comes and the mister needs me.’ That is the idea I always have in my head, but it’s also where it is most difficult because the only way to really get up to speed is to play 90 minutes regularly. That’s particularly the case for me because of my attributes as a striker. I need to feel strong and be in the best physical condition possible in order to show my best<br /><br /><b>[After revealing he would like to remain in north London for another year, Llorente praised the Argentine for his motivational skills]</b> He’s a manager who gives a lot of freedom to his players in order to get the best out of them. He’s not the kind of manager who says, ‘You have to do this, this and this.’ He shows you that he trusts you and he doesn’t kick you off the team if you mess up or you do something bad. That mentality is something he drums into us. He knows how to motivate us and get the best out of us. It’s the way he has of managing the group, planning the training sessions and making sure we are all happy.</p>

It’s sad because I believed in this team but we couldn’t give all our best to fight for the match.<br /><br />I don’t have any doubt <b>[we can reach the final again]</b>. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is a club that has grown a lot in recent years.
