  <p><b>[Pauleta on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>, after the Swede broke the former <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>’s goal-scoring record at the club]</b> Every record is made to be broken. I myself overtook <b>[Dominique]</b> Rocheteau. But I’m happy about it. We’re not talking about just anyone. We’re talking about Ibrahimovic - a great player with extraordinary ability. It had to happen one day. And Ibrahimovic deserves to dethrone me</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal legend Pauleta has heaped praise upon <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> ahead of Sunday’s Nations League final against Netherlands]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is a fantastic player. In my opinion he is from another world. He has made and continues to make footballing history. It is difficult to find another player that has performed as consistently as he has over such a lengthy period of time. I hope he achieves it <b>[the record]</b> because it would be great for Portuguese football.<br /><br /><b>[Netherlands ran out 3-0 victors the last time the two sides met in March 2018, but have lost seven of their 13 meetings with the Portuguese]</b> It will not have any bearing on it whatsoever. They are two completely different matches, this time we are playing against a different team and against different players. I am sure that we are going to be treated to an excellent spectacle, our fans will be right behind us spurring us on and hopefully we can get the result. Holland are a great side with lots of young, talented players. However, we also have a very strong team. We are all just hoping to see a great final, with lots of goals and hopefully a win for Portugal, which is obviously our main aim</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> striker Pauleta doesn’t want <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> to leave the club]</b> Edinson is a great player, who is part of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s history. Football is like that, though. I hope everything ends well and that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> mark the occasion<br /><br />The club and the player deserve for it all to finish well. I really like him, he is a great player and a great man. I hope Edinson will continue with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. However, one day, everything comes to an end – ‘football is like that’</p>
