  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho is a level above the rest of Liverpool’s squad]</b> He seems to be a level ahead of even the <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino’s and the Mane’s, he is one of those players that could easily go into a Barcelona or a Real Madrid as he is that clever and he has got such a good football brain, something that us ex-footballers dreamed of having, he is one step ahead.<br /><br />In the Newcastle game, even though we didn’t win, there were flashes in that, the great goal and some of the balls he was putting through. He is instrumental, he is that little bit of stardust that a lot of teams don’t have, he is a top draw player and hopefully he is winning the Liverpool fans back over with his goals and his performances and we can keep hold of him as he is our best player<br /><br /><b>[Matteo believes Oxlade-Chamberlain must show his experience and take some responsibility]</b> I think Oxlade-Chamberlain’s good enough, we’ve only seen bits and pieces of him so far. He needs a run of games, like certain players around the Liverpool set-up, they all need runs of games. He has got a lot of experience, he played a lot of games for Arsenal as a young player and I think he will be a good player for the squad, whether he will start for Liverpool I am not too sure. When we signed him I was thinking where was going to play?<br /><br />I think Jurgen Klopp is thinking that we have got the Champions League, which he wants to do well in. He <b>[Klopp]</b> wants to do well in the league as well and we have got the cups. He is thinking that he is going to have to utilise his squad each week and I think that’s what he’s done, maybe a little too much but we have a decent sized squad. As a player, these are the games that you want to be starting and if he does start on the weekend this is the game he needs to stand up and be counted. To show Liverpool fans that he is here and he means business</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool should be in the market for Gareth Bale]</b> We certainly wouldn’t say no! Possibly. It’s a case of whether the financials could be done. It would be a big signing. If he was coming back to England, I’m sure that everyone would take him<br /><br />With Bale, when Madrid beat Liverpool in the final, he had that bit of X factor. Liverpool could maybe do with one more X factor player to score in the finals. That’s what we’ve lacked that bit of X factor to get us over the line</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Dominic Matteo announces recovery from brain tumour]</b> Yesterday I got THE phone call, the one I’ve been praying for… my brain scan is clear. After 6 months of fear, pain, rehab surgery and treatment. I’m healthy! It feels unreal! The LGI <b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> General Infirmary]</b> and St. James hospital saved my life.

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> promoted to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> It means absolutely everything. It’s incredible. One of the best feelings I’ve ever had, even though I’m not playing or involved with the club, but it’s absolutely fantastic. It feels so good. <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> and the team have done an incredible job. Everything they’ve done from start to finish has been done the right way. They way they play, the way they tackle and get after people. They’ve done everything so well and I’m absolutely delighted for everyone associated with <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>. For all those great people around <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, this is for them. It’s absolutely brilliant</p>
