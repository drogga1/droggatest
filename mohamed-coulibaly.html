  <p><b>[AAS Sarcelles Director Mohamed Coulibaly on <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a>]</b> He was very frail. But he never gave up and that’s paying off. You can see on the pitch that he never hides. From very early on he learned to take responsibilities. He has something more than technique, he has the guts and character that make great players</p>
