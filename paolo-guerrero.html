  <p><b>[Peru striker Paolo Guerrero has played down his achievement of becoming the nation’s all-time leading goalscorer on Saturday]</b> These tournaments are tough and are really difficult to win. The team tired a bit towards the end but we withstood the pressure. My job for the team is to maximise and make sure they get the experience they need. Hopefully the Copa America helps them a lot.<br /><br /><b>[Guerrero’s goal came in the 61st minute, as he converted Edison Flores’ cross with a brilliant diving header]</b> I had to be well-positioned. I knew that in any moment <b>[the ball]</b> would come to me. The ball came to me and I was able to convert</p>

  <p><b>[Peru captain Paolo Guerrero called for the surprise Copa America finalists to be shown more respect following their commanding 3-0 semi-final triumph over defending champions Chile]</b> The team is making history. I’m proud of my team-mates. We concentrated, we worked hard and we are in the final. It’s going to be a very difficult final. I respect Brazil a lot and I am happy <b>[playing for my club]</b> here but in football there are no favourites, and we showed that again today. We won convincingly when others talked about Chile. Those people have to have more respect. If Brazil want to call themselves favourites then they can call themselves favourites, but on the field we do not think about that. We have to do our work with a lot of humility, as always.</p>

<a href="everton-soares.html">Everton Soares</a> supplied the same electric pace and dribbling ability as his more illustrious compatriot and shared the Golden Boot with Paolo Guerrero with three goals, including a fine finish to open the scoring against Peru.</p>
