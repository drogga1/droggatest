  <p><b>[Peru striker Paolo Guerrero has played down his achievement of becoming the nation’s all-time leading goalscorer on Saturday]</b> These tournaments are tough and are really difficult to win. The team tired a bit towards the end but we withstood the pressure. My job for the team is to maximise and make sure they get the experience they need. Hopefully the Copa America helps them a lot.<br /><br /><b>[Guerrero’s goal came in the 61st minute, as he converted Edison Flores’ cross with a brilliant diving header]</b> I had to be well-positioned. I knew that in any moment <b>[the ball]</b> would come to me. The ball came to me and I was able to convert</p>

  <p><b>[Paolo Guerrero will be able to feature at World Cup 2018 after the Swiss Federal Court agreed to suspend a drugs ban lingering over him]</b> The Court of Arbitration for Sport <b>[CAS]</b> has been informed of the appeal and the urgent request for the sanction presented by the Peruvian soccer player Paolo Guerrero before the Swiss Federal Court <b>[TFS]</b>. The appeal is directed against the decision of the CAS, which partially accepted the appeal filed by the World Anti-Doping Agency <b>[WADA]</b> against the decision issues by the FIFA Appeals Committee on December 20, 2017, under which the suspension of Mr Guerrero was extended from six to 14 months. Mr Guerrero submitted an urgent request for the suspension of the execution of that sanction in order to participate in the next FIFA World Cup in Russia.</p>

  <p><b>[Paolo Guerrero to take out World Cup frustration on Australia after fighting ban to feature]</b> I wanted to be on a par with my team-mates, who all have 65-70 games from the previous season under their belts. It’s tough to accept, but the most important thing is that I’m here, and can help the squad. I’m trying to enjoy it to the fullest<br /><br />Against Australia, we’re definitely going for the win. Our heads are not down, because we’ve shown that we can play a bit, but we’re still sad, because I think we deserved better luck. We know how we’ve performed, we’re pleased with the level we’ve played at, and I think this young squad will go on to compete at future World Cups - I have full confidence in them. But for now, we have to focus on the task at hand: making sure we don’t leave Russia empty-handed<br /><br />My team-mates are fully focused on the game with Australia. It would be nice to score a goal; I was on the hunt for one in the last two games. I’ll be looking for one again, but the main priority is that the team gets a win. I’ve not been putting too much pressure on myself to score. I just want to help, either by getting my name on the scoreboard or by setting up one of my team-mates for a goal<br /><br />Peru is a football nation, and the fans have given this team a lot of love, confidence and support. As a group, we are all very grateful for that. The country has united behind the national team, and that’s great to see</p>

  <p><b>[Peru captain Paolo Guerrero called for the surprise Copa America finalists to be shown more respect following their commanding 3-0 semi-final triumph over defending champions Chile]</b> The team is making history. I’m proud of my team-mates. We concentrated, we worked hard and we are in the final. It’s going to be a very difficult final. I respect Brazil a lot and I am happy <b>[playing for my club]</b> here but in football there are no favourites, and we showed that again today. We won convincingly when others talked about Chile. Those people have to have more respect. If Brazil want to call themselves favourites then they can call themselves favourites, but on the field we do not think about that. We have to do our work with a lot of humility, as always.</p>
