  <p><b>[Toronto FC’s Sebastian Giovinco has given his backing to former club Juventus]</b> I think it might be their season. Moreover, in the summer they have improved by signing important players. They’re clearly favourites to win the Scudetto as well. Juventus have gained more awareness of their own resources. The arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, who knows how to win in Europe, is undoubtedly a a major help.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he had any regrets about leaving the Italian champions]</b> No regrets. Evidently this was my path. I won a lot at Juventus and for that I’m very happy. <b>[Major League Soccer]</b> is improving, even thought it remains to be seen how much it wants to keep improving. I think about going back to Italy sometimes, that’s normal. When you’re away from Italy you miss it in a general sense. I still have a year on my contract in Toronto and I’m very happy living this experience</p>
