  <p><b>[Sebastian Giovinco is determined to earn a place in the Italy squad for Euro 2016]</b> Some believed that I wouldn’t return to the national team, but I did well here and I was called up again. The coach says that he puts no limits <b>[on who he will call up]</b>, so I know it’s only going to be down to me to earn his attention. The different calendar in MLS may represent an advantage, but honestly it’s largely an irrelevant one. Starting from today, though, I’m back in the race. The coach already has some ideas, but in three months there’s enough time to make some changes. Knowing that I’ll be called up if I do well but left at home if I don’t is helpful, regardless of what people may say about my peace of mind.<br /><br />We certainly don’t have the strikers that we used to and the numbers prove that. But now we have elements that can do really well when they’re placed in teams that are set up properly. We used to rely on the creativity of an individual, now it’s more about the game. Times have changed, and everyone has their own opinion. It’s a good thing that I can’t take my place for granted. This has always been the case for me, and it’s something that strengthened my character</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC star Sebastian Giovinco is also back in the international fold]</b> I am happy to be back wearing the Italy jersey and to have recaptured a place in the national team. Just being here is already a victory, one I really hoped for and wanted, because it was by no means to be taken for granted. In Toronto not just football, but all sports are experienced as moments of enjoyment and celebration. It’s a wonderful atmosphere. My current club never put any pressure on me. In fact, they are all happy that I’m here on international duty.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC’s Sebastian Giovinco has given his backing to former club Juventus]</b> I think it might be their season. Moreover, in the summer they have improved by signing important players. They’re clearly favourites to win the Scudetto as well. Juventus have gained more awareness of their own resources. The arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, who knows how to win in Europe, is undoubtedly a a major help.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he had any regrets about leaving the Italian champions]</b> No regrets. Evidently this was my path. I won a lot at Juventus and for that I’m very happy. <b>[Major League Soccer]</b> is improving, even thought it remains to be seen how much it wants to keep improving. I think about going back to Italy sometimes, that’s normal. When you’re away from Italy you miss it in a general sense. I still have a year on my contract in Toronto and I’m very happy living this experience</p>
