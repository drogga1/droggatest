  <p><b>[César Luis Menotti, in an interview]</b> There have been four kings of football - Di Stéfano, <a href="pele.html">Pelé</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> and <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> - and the fifth has not yet appeared. We are awaiting the fifth, and it is sure to be <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but so far he is not among the kings. You can’t give him the crown after five years</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina’s world cup-winning coach Cesar Luis Menotti on Pele]</b> The best of all was <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, who is a mixture of Di Stefano, <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> and Leo Messi.</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Luis Menotti says Not even Johan Cruyff or Pep Guardiola could turn things around with the current Argentina team]</b> Neither Cruyff nor Guardiola today could turn the history of the Argentine national team. It reflects the present great complexity that Argentina is living through. Scaloni, of course, has to be evaluated, because we are all evaluated every day. It is essential to see the complete development, the complete overview. If we do not do so and we only partially look at it, then we are wrong. This selection had almost no rehearsal, it goes out and plays, and of course it is exposed, without a broad plan of work and without a schedule that all the areas of football respect, especially the <b>[club]</b> leaders. The selection will not recover.<br /><br /><b>[Menotti elaborated on his criticism of clubs. Menotti says the leaders of Superliga Argentina clubs refused to buy into the AFA’s plans]</b> There was an intention to organise the selection, to train, to get together, to have a group of players training in Argentina. But the leaders did not allow it because of different interests, and that greatly weakens any player and any coach. Argentina has to improvise and there is a political use of criticism, criticising a selection project that will start now, because when I arrived <b>[at the AFA]</b> there was only the president of the AFA, that’s why I am surprised by the opportunist leaders who criticise when the national team loses and they’re never worried. There are leaders who expect Argentina to be eliminated. It is obvious that it’s wrong for the us to rely on them when they did nothing to defend the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Luis Menotti claims <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has ‘advantage’ over Lautaro as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> weigh up bids]</b> Rumours about <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s possible return and Lautaro’s signing are on the front pages these days and I understand fans are excited. The first thing I would like to say is that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> must continue to strengthen an idea of play that they had with <b>[Johan]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, up to <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and with the coaches who have followed their methodology. In a team that has a ‘mother’ idea and a <b>[clear]</b> functioning, it is much more likely that a great player will adapt. In that sense, we could say that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has an advantage over Lautaro. Either of the two players would strengthen <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s play, but the only player who can win games when the team doesn’t deserve it is already there and that’s Messi</p>
