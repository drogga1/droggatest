<blockquote>
  <p>[Why most Man Utd fans want Man City to win Premier League instead of Liverpool] It’s mainly historic, due to the fact that throughout many people’s lifetimes they’ve been the team that we’ve always competed against, whereas City are sort of new kids on the block in that sense. And whilst that might change in the future, at the moment the majority of United fans I’d say would consider Liverpool to be our biggest rivals. It’s drummed into you from a young age that Liverpool are United’s biggest rivals. I never saw Liverpool’s glory days but even during the 90s City were never a threat, it was only probably around 2009 or 2010 that they started becoming serious rivals. So, maybe youngsters might consider it to be City, but the majority still think of Liverpool as the major rivals.<br /><br />I was quite surprised by the extent of it when all the questions cropped up recently about ‘Would you rather beat Paris Saint-Germain or Liverpool and end up helping City win the league?’. I did a poll on it, asking which you would rather win of the FA Cup game against Chelsea, PSG at home or Liverpool at home. I said that a trophy was the important one for me so picked the FA Cup game because that was the best chance we had, but about 86 per cent said they’d rather beat Liverpool at home, which gives you a measure. Now there’s all the questions of beating City to look after your own interests or do you want to lose to them and I’ve been quite shocked by the extent to which people would want to lose a Manchester derby. The way I see it, it’s pretty inevitable that Liverpool will win one and they’d still be behind us in terms of league titles. I’m hoping they won’t win the European Cup because that puts United even further behind [a sixth title to United’s three]. But, whilst I’m a spokesperson for the whole support, personally I’d rather United look after their own interests before considering others because I’d rather United’s improvement was accelerated by getting into the European Cup and being able to buy better targets available to them rather than worrying about a few Liverpool fans bragging on social media or the media fawning over them. But a lot of United fans are sick at the thought of them winning the league</p>
