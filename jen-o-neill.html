<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Vivianne Miedema crowned FWA Women’s Footballer of the Year]</b> This was a close-run decision because of the brilliant breakout season that Beth England had with the Lionesses and WSL champions <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. However, Vivianne’s clinical efficiency in front of goal and her seemingly effortless poise, can mean her all-round ability and footballing intelligence are sometimes overlooked. She is a worthy winner and a world-class performer. With more assists than any other WSL player this season, she is also a valuable creator of openings for team-mates; dropping to collect the ball and playing in others, or making space with her movement. Although a humble and laid-back character, she is also determined that the women’s game carries on breaking barriers, and she continues to co-author a series of children’s books to entertain and inspire young players in the Netherlands</p>
