  <p><b>[Porto reveal <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a> retirement]</b> I was very happy. <a href="iker-casillas.html">Casillas</a> had an attitude that touched me a lot, because before announcing the candidacy he made a point of coming to Porto to have lunch with me to communicate that he would make that decision and end his career. He has a great career, in which he has only been in two clubs and we know he has both at heart</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd blocked <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> return to Porto after short-term deal had been agreed]</b> We were without a coach in the middle of the season. I approached <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, who had a contract with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but he was only going to start the following season, and asked if he could come until the end of the season before his move to Manchester. It seemed impossible. But not for him, he said yes. There was a cup final at the time, a league cup final and he said he was coming. And when we were thinking it was possible, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did not authorise it as they argued that we could be opponents in a European competition. But a lot of people ignore the fact that, without any conditions, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was available to spend half a season at Porto in an emergency. It is a fact that is unknown, but it shows the affection he had <b>[for the club]</b></p>
