  <p><b>[The 26-year-old has been detained in the South-East Asian nation for the past 50 days]</b> Former Bahraini national footballer, Hakeem al-Araibi, found refuge and safety in Australia after fleeing torture and persecution in his home country. Now, he is languishing in immigration detention in Thailand and could be deported back to certain danger in Bahrain. We know that Hakeem faces imprisonment and torture if he is sent back to Bahrain. Tell the Thai authorities to release Hakeem immediately, and allow him to return to his friends, colleagues and teammates in Australia.</p>

  <p><b>[Hakeem al-Araibi arrives home in Australia to a crowd of support]</b> I would like to say thanks to Australia. It’s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people and all of the media who supported me. And I just wanted to thank the Australian Government … I want to thank this man <b>[Craig Foster]</b> and his fight for my case … I would like to thank him very much. I will be more strong for my country. I will be strong here, just for Australia. And Australia, this is my country. I don’t have citizenship yet, but my country is Australia. I will die in Australia and I love Australia. Thank you very much</p>
