  <p><b>[Chelsea would be better advised spending £50 million on Marko Arnautovic than Callum Wilson]</b> I’ve played with Marko and I said then that he could definitely go into the top four in the top English tier. He’s got that arrogance about him that he knows he’s a good player and when he was at Stoke he played in the wide areas and drifted inside and scored the goals. Now he’s at West Ham he’s a focal point up top, he loves being there. I think he’ll cost a lot more than £35m.<br /><br />If it was £50m between Wilson or Arnautovic, me personally, I’d go with Marko. I’ve played with him and I know what he could do. He’d be a player that would thrive there because he’d fit in the dressing room straight away and have the ego to go and say, ‘This is a big club, I can match this.’ Especially as a striker, you need that. Look at most top goalscorers in world football, they’ve carried teams on their back at times. At Stoke, he grew up. The first season he was in and out and a little bit frustrated.<br /><br />The second season I was at Stoke he got his head down and when he did that and he was concentrated you saw his capabilities. It took him time to realise how good he was and grow up a bit as well. What a signing that would be</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have become a selling club]</b> I was at Arsenal when the club left Highbury to go the Emirates to start competing at the top of world football, but it’s not really materialised. The Aaron Ramsey situation is just frightening. They’ve backed themselves into a corner with the wages they’re paying <b>[Mesut]</b> Ozil - and even that saga was a strange one - and they’ve got to let him <b>[Ramsey]</b> go now. They’re slowly becoming a selling club where their best players are leaving, and if they don’t buck their ideas up they are really going to fall short of top-four football.<br /><br />I’ve watched Arsenal a lot this year and I think that run papered over a lot of cracks in their performances. It hasn’t been great, there were plenty of games where they could have lost. They rode their luck on a few games, they weren’t blowing things away at all. It was only going to be a matter of time before that came to a halt, and they’re on a bad run of form at the moment. It was always going to be a tough transition, but they’re doing better than I thought they would, I thought they were going to be around the mid-table mark, I really did. And then you’ve got the politics going on upstairs with transfers, the ownership, directors and sporting director and all that now - there is not an alignment from top to bottom and it really needs to be restructured or they could be in real trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Sidwell says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s shock departure from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in September 2007 left the likes of <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> crying on the floor]</b> I never felt that tension or thought he was in trouble. There were a few games before, you could see things in the press and it really bubbled up. But you didn’t feel it on the inside. The players were all united, no one was turning against him, he hadn’t lost the dressing room. The day he went, I was driving my wife to the airport and the news came on the radio. I just thought, ‘Shit, he’s gone. What’s going to happen?’ We were then all called into a meeting at Cobham. It was awkward when Jose came to say his goodbyes. You could have heard a pin drop. It felt like someone had died. When you see strong characters like <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> and <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> either crying on the floor or certainly welling up … I got upset as well. It was really weird.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was sitting there at the front and he says, ‘Steve, you’re going to wear No. 9 this year.’ Every player who joins a new club looks at the numbers available and I’d seen the numbers 9, 14 and others that went upwards from there. I just assumed I may get the No. 14 at a push. I didn’t know whether he was just testing me. If I said, ‘No thanks’ it would look like I had a weakness in my mentality. If I say ‘Yes’, it may have been that he was only joking. But I thought at least I’d then show him I had the balls to wear it. So I said ‘Yes’ and it turned out he was being serious. When I told people, my mates and family, everyone was just laughing. Obviously the number has a lot of history relating to top centre-forwards and that wasn’t me. I went on to score one goal for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Looking back on why he may have made that decision now, I think he was sending a statement upstairs, to the board. That summer he had wanted more money to spend on transfers - but he’s brought in me, Tal Ben Haim and <a href="claudio-pizarro.html">Claudio Pizarro</a> on free transfers. The only big buy was <a href="florent-malouda.html">Florent Malouda</a>. Why didn’t he give Pizarro - a striker - the No. 9? I reckon he was making a point by giving it to a free transfer from Reading</p>
