  <p><b>[David Bentley says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> needs to take an axe to his squad this summer]</b> I don’t know what the thinking is at boardroom level because <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to ship out half the team and get a good core in. That’s difficult but can be done. The major problem is that we don’t know if they’re singing from the same hymn sheet at boardroom level<br /><br /><b>[Bentley pinpointed <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> as a symbol of the club’s current struggles]</b> I don’t know if it’s because of a lack of preparation in getting players in but the recruitment with the back four is a problem. It always has been. <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is problematic. He’s a great technical player but if you want to bring the youth through and create a winning mentality is he really the type to help with that? I was surprised at the new contract. I don’t know why they didn’t look to bring in <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> or someone like that, over <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>. Maybe Luiz is more fashionable. <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> has the core ability and has been there and done it. He would have been more of a fit for Arsenal<br /><br />You look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are trying to do it - and they build a solid foundation that allows the players to express themselves. If you have solid back-four and solid spine of the team it’s easier for the young players to step into that. Instead <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> leak goals and look vulnerable</p>

  <p><b>[David Bentley claims <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is getting shafted by <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>]</b> <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>. He could do anything. We had numerous players when I was there who were talented and young footballers. We had loads. It’s only when I look back that I see we were a really great football team. We didn’t win anything but should have with <b>[Luka]</b> <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> and <b>[Rafael]</b> <a href="rafael-van-der-vaart.html">van der Vaart</a> and <b>[Jermain]</b> <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Defoe</a>, but <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> could do anything. His tackles were better. His free-kicks were better. He could throw it longer than anyone else and run faster and was stronger. He could leap and get up for a header. Literally an all-rounder.<br /><br />I just can’t believe what’s happening to him at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I think <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> isn’t happy that Gareth scored a better goal than him. It sounds like a personal thing. The thing is <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> isn’t arrogant. He’s quiet. He will eat his dinner and not say much so maybe they then think he’s arrogant and just wants to play golf and not socialise, but he just wants to get on with what he’s getting on with. It annoys me because I always looked out for him. I watch him still at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to see how he’s doing. He’s a lovely boy, well he’s a man now, and he’s done so well for himself. He is so successful yet he’s getting shafted</p>

  <p><b>[The ex-England international said of Kane:]</b> When you have <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> in charge people won’t leave unless it’s financially correct for the football club. We will have to see how badly the club miss out on gate revenue because that’s what the stadium was built for and Champions League football is where the players want to be, but nobody will leave unless there is an extraordinary offer that’s for sure</p>
