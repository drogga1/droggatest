  <p><b>[Michael Dawson says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s mooted move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will happen]</b> When they signed him for £17m, you think: ‘Wow, that’s a lot of money’. But what he’s gone on to bring for them … With big Wes <b>[Morgan]</b> and <b>[Robert]</b> Huth winning the Premier League, the different side of the game that Harry could bring was just incredible. Leicester have had him for two years and he’s had the opportunity to have the England career he’s having at the moment. He’ll be there for many years. He’s a top-class player. When the deal does happen, and you think it will happen now with the figures that are being bandied around, you’re going to wonder how Leicester do turn it down. How can you stop a player like Harry, what he’s done for them, to go and play for a team like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, a massive football club?<br /><br /><b>[Dawson, who is now on the books at <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>, believes Maguire is deserving of a step up the Premier League ladder]</b> You’ve seen him playing in all the pre-season friendlies. You see some players trying to force moves that refuse to play. That’s one thing Harry’s not done. He’s one of those characters. He’s a great lad who keeps his head down and works</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Dawson says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> will be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> captain]</b> He is one of those lads who will walk into the dressing room and settle in straight away. One day you can see him being a captain of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Give him time to settle in, and I am sure he will be a captain of that club one day<br /><br /><b>[Dawson believes the England international is well worth the investment from the <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> hierarchy]</b> What makes him an £80m player is his distribution. He can bring the ball out from the back, he is comfortable in tight areas. He gets out of trouble and that is what makes him an elite player</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Michael Dawson is another who feels that every effort should be made to bring <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> back onto Spurs’ books six-and-a-half years after he left for Spain]</b> Well, what a shrewd move <b>[re-signing Bale]</b> would be. He’s been to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and won every trophy - but what would that cost? He is a world class player. Whether he would come back, whether Daniel <b>[Levy]</b> could afford his wages; those type of questions you have to ask, because the figures Gareth is supposedly on are incredible and way out of Spurs’ wage budget and bracket. That is where <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> always seem to struggle. It looks like his term is nearly ending at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and I was thinking there is so much left for Gareth to give. I would love to see him back in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - what a player. I was lucky to share the same dressing room as him, and he could win games on his own; it was incredible to play in a team like that</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Dawson says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been warned that <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> could follow <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> out of the club]</b> The first thing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has to do now <b>[is convince the players to stay]</b>. That group of players loved <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>. What he has done for the last five years is absolutely incredible. He made <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, and all I would say is I hope that doesn’t make him go, ‘now I want to leave’. You look at <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> and <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> … do they want to stay? Those kind of players, having your contract running out can be unsettling and once one leaves, it can maybe have a knock-on effect</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Dawson was another who saw <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> go from zero to hero in a short space of time]</b> The <b>[FA Cup]</b> semi-final was on the Sunday <b>[April 11, 2010]</b>, then we had these two huge games. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, six massive points in terms of the top four. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> scored in both games. I remember him cutting in from the left and hitting it right foot against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. They scored late in that game and I had to make a challenge on <b>[Didier]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> late on. Things like that stand out. Gareth, some of the goals he scored were incredible. He’d just get you up the pitch with his speed and power, you’d be defending in your area and he’d get it and just run the length of the pitch! The next season, Champions League, talk about make a name of yourself… special times</p>
