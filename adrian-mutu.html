  <dd>Less than a year after that explosive start and a little over a month since <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> had arrived to replace <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a>, Mutu found himself subject to a doping test. Nothing unusual for a professional footballer, except this was not carried out by anti-doping authorities, but by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. The club had grown suspicious after a dip in his form on the pitch and increasingly unreliable behaviour off it. It came back negative. But another, carried out by the usual authorities two months later, showed cocaine in Mutu’s system. He was banned for seven months and summarily sacked</dd>

There were <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <b>[Roberto]</b> Baggio, <b>[Ivan]</b> <a href="ivan-zamorano.html">Zamorano</a>, <b>[Javier]</b> <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a>, <b>[Alvaro]</b> <a href="alvaro-recoba.html">Recoba</a>, <b>[Christian]</b> Panucci, <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a>, <b>[Angelo]</b> <a href="angelo-peruzzi.html">Peruzzi</a>, <b>[Laurent]</b> Blanc, <b>[Luigi]</b> Di Biagio, <b>[Clarence]</b> <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, <b>[Ivan]</b> <a href="ivan-cordoba.html">Cordoba</a>, and they were all my idols. I shared the dressing room with them. I admired and appreciated them. We were given a penalty kick during a training match once. I was in a team with Baggio and asked him if I could take it. I lobbed <a href="angelo-peruzzi.html">Peruzzi</a> and hit the bar. At that moment, the ‘bear’ <a href="angelo-peruzzi.html">Peruzzi</a> gets up and starts chasing me. I had to run all the way to the third pitch, and I didn’t come back until I knew he was gone<br /><br />Some time after my arrival at Inter, they gave me a car. I was on the highway and I heard Veiri coming from behind. He had a Ferrari. He looked at me, laughed and drove off. I arrived at Pinetina 15 minutes later. I wanted to park but he told me that you could only park your Ferrari or Lamborghini there. I had to go to the third parking lot and walked all the way. When I returned to my house, I called my agent to ask him about the first salary, because they only wanted Ferrari and Lamborghini there</p>

I have been in good condition for five days and he knew that. I don’t care about being fined. I want everyone to know that the national team is the most important thing for me.

Such a match is so important for the national team that I cannot miss it<br /><br /><b>[Mutu had a lot of questions to answer over his involvement with drugs]</b> I am not hooked on drugs. I categorically deny this. The only reason I took what I took was because I wanted to improve my sexual performance. It may be funny but it is true. I did not take cocaine. I took something to make me feel good<br /><br /><b>[He showed his compassionate side in 2013 when he revealed plans to adopt a baby rescued from a Chinese sewage pipe]</b> I couldn’t figure out how to carry on living, how to eat my breakfast, when I saw this story on TV. He’s a special child. When I saw the baby I said: ‘I must adopt him, he has been sent to me by God’. Just look at this poor little fellow. He made such a strong impression on me. I told my wife we have to help him, we have to do everything we can. I never thought I would adopt a baby, I had no plan concerning that, but I just know I have to help this one<br /><br /><b>[He attributed his calmness to his time in Florence, a tranquil setting far removed from the distractions he found unavoidable in London]</b> Florence is home for me. People here love me and I have forgotten about the cocaine and my sad time in London. Recently my agent Alessandro <a href="luciano-moggi.html">Moggi</a> presented me with some offers from Premiership clubs, but without meaning any offence, I would not go back to London if they paid me a fortune in gold<br /><br />I’ve got nothing against English people - they are very nice and they are crazy for football - and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is clearly a great competition, but nowhere is as good as Florence for me</p>
