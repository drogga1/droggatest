  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham on Thierry Henry]</b> <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> is immense, he’s got incredible pace and it just seems he has different gears and when he gets into that third gear it’s just end of story for anyone chasing him. His pace scares defenders and I just wish I’d had half of it. But it’s not just about pace; he’s got great skill</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> You need someone in a team to dictate the pace of the play and Roy does that perfectly. He defends - he’s a good tackler and a good header of the ball - and starts attacks, and passes the ball with metronomic accuracy. He works tirelessly and demands so much from his team-mates. When things are tough, like they were when United were 2-0 down in Turin in the 1999 European Cup Semi-Final, Keane gets going. But even when things are going well, he drives the team on</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> As a player, he reminds me of (Jurgen) <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a>, that enthusiasm that Jurgen had when he first came to the club, that bounding stride, I think Harry has that. He runs at defenders, can hold the ball up and the most important thing is that he scores goals. He scores all types of goals as well. He gets in the six-yard box, he’ll strike it from the edge of the box and outside the box. I like Harry. I’ve met him a couple of times and you can tell he wants to learn which is a big factor for a young footballer. He’s not big-time one bit. I just love the way he’s taken on the mantle of being the number one striker, because it’s not easy. He’s gone in there and said ‘bring it on, I’ll have some of that’ and long may it continue</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> There’re always doubts there but he’s shown he can do it. He’s a fantastic player, full of goals at the moment, full of optimism, full of confidence. That’s how you want your strikers. He’s proving that he’s in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he’s there to stay. That’s what a second season is for. He’s proven himself with flying colours. It’s very exciting</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> He’s a complete striker. He can score with his left foot, right foot and with his head, from distance and from close range. He can run long or drop into areas that ask defenders questions and he can hold up the ball. He’s only 22 and you don’t really get to know your game until you’re 26/27 and in your prime. He can score goals and he wants to show you he can score goals, long may that continue!</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham claims Leicester defender Harry Maguire could be their version of Vincent Kompany or Tony Adams]</b> Central defence is a big area where they need to find a Vincent Kompany or Tony Adams-type player. I think Harry Maguire is the one for me. He’s got great leadership qualities, and has a real calming influence. He’s very similar to Rio Ferdinand, in that he’s cool on the ball and defends very well. That would be a fine start from my point of view. Top players like Harry are going to have the choice of some big, big clubs around Europe this summer.<br /><br /><b>[Home-grown talent has played a big part in the club’s past]</b> I really believe they should go back to the British mentality. The core of any good, British team, comes from British players, as I see it. Over the last 20 or 30 years, if a British team does well in the league or in Europe, there’s always a core of British players involved</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham says Gareth Bale needs to consider a move to Manchester United]</b> Zidane has come in and has said in not so many words: ‘I want to get rid of Gareth Bale’. If the manager doesn’t bring him on as one his three substitutes when Real Madrid are losing, he’s basically saying ‘I want Gareth Bale to go’. Gareth Bale will be saying what a lot of the Manchester United players will say this season, with a cigar in his mouth sitting in the corner of the dressing room: ‘Well, give me my money and I’ll go then, otherwise I’m not going anywhere because I signed a long-term contract’. I don’t think it is a war that Gareth Bale is going to win.<br /><br />If I came in to contact with Gareth Bale and had to give him some advice, I would say: ‘Get yourself out of there. Don’t worry about the £30 million that you’re meant to be earning over the next two years. You will enjoy your life a lot more if you get out of Real Madrid and play football for a club that you want to play for and that’s going to love you’. I think he would be a good acquisition for any of the top clubs in England and I think they will all be after him because he’s a game-changer.</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham says There are big problems at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is one of them]</b> There are big problems at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and I think <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is one of them. I know he hasn’t been playing for a couple of months, and we can’t blame him for what’s happening on the pitch now, but we’re still talking about him. When you look to your leaders as players, you want someone who is going to give their all 100 per cent every game.<br /><br />He’s obviously a talented lad but his demeanour sometimes when you’re looking for people to dig deep doesn’t really go with the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fans and the way they’ve been brought up and the players they’ve seen over the years. You think about <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, with their desire to dig deep and turn things around, and you look at <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> on the pitch trotting about - is he going to turn things around when things are bad? He hasn’t really dug deep at major times for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I think people have had enough of him<br /><br /><b>[Sheringham believes <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> should be given significant funds to bolster the squad over the next two or three transfer windows]</b> There are definitely things wrong at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and they’ve got to change. I know from my time in managing that you need to change things around, but you can’t change things overnight. If they’re going to stick with <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, which I think they should do, they’ve got to back him. They have to give him two or three transfer windows and back him. You have to remember when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> came over he didn’t get <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> right straight away, it takes 12 or 18 months before your philosophies of football are ground into every player so they understand. You’ve got to give Ole a chance, give him another couple of windows and make sure he’s getting his players in before you blame him for what’s happening on the pitch. It takes time</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> gives off bad vibes, he’s no <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> The big one for me is <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. There’s been a lot of talk about him, when you mention top players, captains, when things weren’t going right in our time, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> put things right. He would drive our team on. He would dig deep, he would make sure we had a say in every game we played in, because of his desire, and I think when you look at <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, does he have the same mentality? Yes he might be a talented boy, but does he really dig deep, does he get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> out of the mire when the going gets tough? For me the answers are no, he gives off the wrong vibe as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player. Yes it’s good to be cocky and arrogant at the right times, I would say <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> had that with a big smile on his face, cocky and arrogant, but he had a desire to do things right as well at the right times, and I think you’ve got to have that. And I don’t think <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> gives you that, and I think he would be one that would need to go so that you can get someone else in with the right mentality and the right desire. The <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> way to drive your team on to make sure you get out of the position you’re in to move the club forward<br /><br />When you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, I think they’re a long way off. I like what Ole’s doing up there. I think there’s a nice feeling about the club at the moment, I think he’s had a very good starting period. He’s had an unsettling time, but I think he’s steadied the ship now, I think things are going in the right direction, but still a long, long way off challenging the top two for the championship. They need to recruit in the right manner, get the right people out as well, which isn’t easy when you’re at a football club, they need to be moving in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham has been urged <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> to weigh up his options carefully]</b> There are similarities but you have to look at where they are and where <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were when I was playing for them. I think the ambition had been sucked out of the club when I was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, we weren’t really going places. At least with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at the moment they’re getting in the top four, they’re challenging for things, they were in the Champions League final not long ago. He’s got to work out his situation, does he want to leave? Will there be top players coming to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to play with him, or does he have to leave to play with top players? At the moment, I’d say his career at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> has been steadily going forward but I think it might be at a crossroads. If not this year, if they haven’t won anything or look like they’re challenging for things and moving forwards, there could be changes. Harry only has one career and he wants to win things. We’ll see what happens but my advice would be ‘you only get one career, Harry, make sure you make the most of it’.</p>
