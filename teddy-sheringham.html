He defends - he’s a good tackler and a good header of the ball - and starts attacks, and passes the ball with metronomic accuracy. He works tirelessly and demands so much from his team-mates. When things are tough, like they were when United were 2-0 down in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> in the 1999 European Cup Semi-Final, Keane gets going. But even when things are going well, he drives the team on</p>

He runs at defenders, can hold the ball up and the most important thing is that he scores goals. He scores all types of goals as well. He gets in the six-yard box, he’ll strike it from the edge of the box and outside the box. I like Harry. I’ve met him a couple of times and you can tell he wants to learn which is a big factor for a young footballer. He’s not big-time one bit. I just love the way he’s taken on the mantle of being the number one striker, because it’s not easy. He’s gone in there and said ‘bring it on, I’ll have some of that’ and long may it continue</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has been urged to consider a move away from Manchester United]</b> I said at the start of the season about Marcus Rashford that he needs to play games. He needs to learn what he can get away with on a football pitch, what he can do, what he can’t do. You don’t learn that by watching other people play. I don’t care how good the players are, it’s all about experience, it’s about making mistakes along the way and coming up against these players week in, week out and knowing how to prepare to play next season and the season after that. But if you don’t get the experience, you don’t get the chance. All you do is sit and watch and you make mistakes later in life. He needs to learn now, he’s an unbelievable talent for me, and he needs to be playing in a first-team somewhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Teddy Sheringham is the latest former Manchester United star to have questioned Jose Mourinho’s methods]</b> Once you play for United, once you’ve been around the scene for a year or a couple of years you know what is expected of you playing for Manchester United - especially when you play for Sir Alex. He had a way of making you feel you had to perform at your top capabilities every game, because everyone expects that. And that means going forward, exciting the fans, taking the game to the opposition and that was what he just demanded. You look at the game at the moment and it’s very different for Manchester United. I can understand why the Manchester United fans, diehard ones who have been watching for 20, 30, 40 years are just looking at going, ‘This isn’t Manchester United’</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane will not be prepared to become a ‘nearly man’ at Tottenham]</b> Harry will want to win stuff. He will be wanting to play at the very top. It’s going to be a big factor with Harry that Tottenham are moving into a new stadium - but they have to win something. At the moment, they are nearly at the top. For me, that’s not good enough for Harry Kane because he is tops.<br /><br />There is going to come a time in Harry’s career when he is going to say: ‘I can’t be a nearly man any more. We have to go one step further for me to win things in my football career. You don’t get any younger in football and it’s amazing how quickly it flies by</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s luxury new stadium can become a fortress for Mauricio Pochettino’s side]</b> In the long run, when it’s our home, I think it can be a real fortress. And if the quicker we get accustomed to that, the better, for the players. That’s why I think it’s good for them to be playing at the end of this season so that you can feel like you’re going into a new season next year, really understanding what the new stadium is like and what it’s all about. So, you have to get your bearings and your surroundings on a football pitch, and the quicker you get accustomed to it, the better<br /><br />For me, why would he want to be leaving Tottenham? The club is on the up, it’s a fantastic club to be involved with, I think all the supporters love him. There’s not like a 60-40 split or anything like that other people want him to leave, everybody can see that the club is on the up, the football team is on the up. They’re just moving into a new stadium, he’s working with some of the best players, not only in the country but in the world, if I had to bet, I would say he’s gonna be staying and looking forward to next season</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino is considered to share many qualities with Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> Looking at the managers, the players are being driven on by their managers. You look at Sir Alex Ferguson, his will to win and desire to fight until the last minute, that was embedded into our football team at the time and it’s the same with Pochettino. He <b>[Pochettino]</b> put the big centre-forward on in the second half <b>[against Ajax]</b> but it wasn’t just all about lump it up to him. They still played at the right times and still got it down in the right hand and left hand corner with the full-backs and still passed their way out of it. And then when it was time to put it up to the big centre-forward, it went up there. That all comes from Pochettino, he tells them how he wants them to play, and he demands how he wants them to play and the desire that they show for the manager, the football club and for the each other last night. Just unbelievable scenes. That’s why he was in such an emotional state at the end of the game last night, because it all came together.<br /><br />All that training, all that focus, and all that positional sense to make everybody understand, that’s where it comes from - plus, a little rub of the green obviously with Ajax hitting the post a couple of times and having chances. They didn’t take their chances and if you refer to 20 years ago, Bayern Munich didn’t take their chances and we had the belief to say that if they don’t take their chances then we’ve still got a chance.<br /><br />I think if you’ve got a British mentality in the core of your team, you look at all the good British teams over the last twenty years, they’ve all got that British core to them. Obviously, the foreign players have come over and there have been some absolutely fantastic players on the way that have joined all of our clubs and enhanced them. You look <b>[Roy]</b> Keane, Dennis Wise and Tony Adams, you look at all of them they’ve all got British mentality within them but with the flair and the guile of the foreigners that have come over as well, so it’s a bit of everything needed</p>

I know he hasn’t been playing for a couple of months, and we can’t blame him for what’s happening on the pitch now, but we’re still talking about him. When you look to your leaders as players, you want someone who is going to give their all 100 per cent every game.<br /><br />He’s obviously a talented lad but his demeanour sometimes when you’re looking for people to dig deep doesn’t really go with the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fans and the way they’ve been brought up and the players they’ve seen over the years. You think about <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, with their desire to dig deep and turn things around, and you look at <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> on the pitch trotting about - is he going to turn things around when things are bad?

There’s been a lot of talk about him, when you mention top players, captains, when things weren’t going right in our time, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> put things right.

Yes he might be a talented boy, but does he really dig deep, does he get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> out of the mire when the going gets tough? For me the answers are no, he gives off the wrong vibe as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player. Yes it’s good to be cocky and arrogant at the right times, I would say <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> had that with a big smile on his face, cocky and arrogant, but he had a desire to do things right as well at the right times, and I think you’ve got to have that.

I like what Ole’s doing up there. I think there’s a nice feeling about the club at the moment, I think he’s had a very good starting period.

At the moment, I’d say his career at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> has been steadily going forward but I think it might be at a crossroads. If not this year, if they haven’t won anything or look like they’re challenging for things and moving forwards, there could be changes. Harry only has one career and he wants to win things. We’ll see what happens but my advice would be ‘you only get one career, Harry, make sure you make the most of it’.</p>
