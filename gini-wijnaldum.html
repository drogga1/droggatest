  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum speaks about one of his childhood interests before football]</b> I wanted to be a gymnast when I was young, I used to do back-flips and all those things in the streeet and at home, but my grandma said it was dangerous and made me stop. Now my daughter is doing gymnastics and I’m a little bit jealous of her because she is doing all the things I wanted to do when I was young. I had to stop and concentrate on football but I’m happy about that now</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum says Jurgen Klopp is the best coach he has worked with]</b> That he is. He’s so passionate. He makes players and teams better. Not one or two players, but really all of them. The way we play, with a lot of movement, always chasing the opponent to create space, high ball circulation, you need to be in top condition. Therefore, the training sessions are harder than the games. Literally every exercise we perform as if it happens in a game.<br /><br />Van Gaal’s sessions were great. But Klopp and I work together every day. They are both honest, they really love their players. You can feel it. Van Gaal was fantastic. During the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, he called me to him and said: ‘Gini, I want to put you in a controlling role to give a starting spot,’ he said. ‘Danny Blind says you can do it. I personally think you cannot’. I liked it, he said exactly what he thought. And you could also discuss things with him, he was never angry. That World Cup in Brazil was a unique experience. For the third place playoff against Brazil, he called me again: ‘It’s time to score again,’ he said. And it worked<br /><br />I’ve never felt this strong. Sometimes we need to do a kilometre run in three minutes and 50 seconds. Immediately afterwards, we play small games and then immediately after that, a kilometre at the same pace. And that for the entire workout. Believe me, you’re tired, you know. But you can find enough to still remain strong in games. Klopp says something like that helps to get through the final stage of a competition.</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum believes former Manchester United attacker Memphis Depay has all it takes to play at the highest level of football]</b> His move to Lyon is interesting. Memphis trains incredibly hard, and he also has everything to reach the top. There was criticism of his game, I understand that. With his options he needs to play more. But the criticism of what he does outside of playing football, I do not understand.<br /><br /><b>[Memphis was criticised in his homeland when he turned up for international duty wearing a hat]</b> Why did he have to score goals to be able to wear a particular garment? I don’t see it.<br /><br />Sometimes it’s luck. It is true that meeting Humphry Nijman <b>[agent]</b> has been the best that has happened to me. Also, when I was 15, I suddenly had a scout from Arsenal on the phone to see if I wanted to come to London. And there were more big clubs. But I wanted to break through at Feyenoord. That is the influence of Nijman. But following my feeling. So I could have gone from PSV to Paris Saint-Germain, but my feeling said no. You must also have the discipline to always want to be better and to work hard every day so that you’re fit as a fiddle and believe in yourself. There was once a coach who said: ‘As a midfielder, you will never get in the national team’. I did not believe him. I wanted to show that I could make it. Liverpool is such a huge club. But even if I had played at another club, I would have been proud. Because if you follow your feelings, you just cannot make mistakes. Did Klopp says that? No, I think about it. But Klopp might say it</p>

  <p><b>[Wijnaldum keen to stress Liverpool’s team ethic as Sadio Mane steals the headlines]</b> He’s really important. But it’s too much Sadio Mane now because he scored two goals, and we had poor results without him. And before he left <b>[for the Africa Cup of Nations]</b> we had good results, only against Sunderland we didn’t, so it’s ‘Sadio Mane, Sadio Mane’. Last week we lost <b>[2-0 at Hull City]</b> with Sadio Mane. So I don’t think it’s fair to the other players to say because of Sadio Mane we win or didn’t win. Of course, he’s a really good player. He helps us with his speed and the kind of quality he has to score goals, but it’s more of a team contribution than just ‘Sadio Mane’. That’s what I think. It’s normal though: if you have poor results without Sadio, everyone will say ‘Sadio Mane.’ If it’s another player, in the time that Phil was injured if we had poor results, everyone would have said ‘Phil Coutinho’. That’s how it is. You have to get used to it, but I don’t think it’s fair.</p>

  <p><b>[Authoritative 2-0 triumph over Tottenham]</b> It’s really important. I think if a manager is saying the same things <b>[that the squad is not good enough]</b> in the situation we were in, that’s killing for a team. That would kill the confidence of the players then, and that’s not a good thing. When you’re a team, you have to believe in each other - you’re a kind of family. And if one yours is saying you’re not good enough, and the kind of things that the media have said, that would be a bad thing. He believes in us - and I don’t think he says this because he wants to keep the confidence up, I think he truly believes in us. This has given us a good feeling because he trusts us.<br /><br />I think in some situations, we put too much pressure on ourselves. That’s why it <b>[the run]</b> went so long. If you have a few poor games in a row, you’re going to put pressure on yourself like ‘we have to win this one or otherwise this, otherwise that,’ and I think we were too busy thinking about the consequences than concentrating on the game. This week we were only concentrating on Tottenham - how are we going to play against them, where we can hurt them and things like that. The focus was different than a few weeks before. That’s only my opinion, I don’t know what the other players think<br /><br />I think we’ve already done it in most of the big games, but in other games we didn’t deliver. That’s the biggest problem of why there was a lot of pressure on us - because only in the biggest games we’ve shown how good we are. First half of the season we also did it in the small games, but December and January was not good months with a lot of games against ‘smaller’ teams<br /><br />To be fair, I don’t think we had the pressure of the title race, I think the pressure was more from outside - they put the pressure on the title race. Of course you know if you have poor results then it’s more difficult to win a title, but you still have second place, third place and fourth place - we must finish as best as possible until the end of the season now</p>

  <p><b>[The evolution of Gini Wijnaldum]</b> I remember that time well. There was a story nearly every day and on one of them, Leroy asked me ‘hey, did you go to Liverpool?’ He’d read in the paper that they bought me for €11 million and that I’d had my medical. So I played along and say ‘yes, it’s all done.’ He was so, so excited that I’d made this big move. He couldn’t stop talking about it and congratulating me, so I had to tell him I was only joking.<br /><br />Dirk used to tell me often that they would talk about me at Melwood, and I knew the scouts were watching me. He’d always say that the club would be a great fit for me and it was good to hear, but I had no intention to leave Feyenoord at that time. I was young and I had a good feeling there so I wanted to continue. I was not busy thinking about moving to a different team. I was not even busy thinking about moving from Holland! I wanted to stay with my family and my friends. A few weeks ago, I spoke to Kenny Dalglish and he told me that he knows all my qualities because he’d watched me for a long time. He was describing goals I scored for Feyenoord and how I played in specific games - he remembered so much!<br /><br />There was really good feeling about the move, from my side and the club’s. I was so happy that the discussions were positive, that we had a shared understanding, and that finally it was the right time for this transfer to happen<br /><br />I have to be honest, in my career I’ve really had to fight to come in the middle again. A lot of managers told me ‘you are way more comfortable as a winger than as a midfielder,’ but I always kept my trust and confidence in what I knew about my qualities. Because I was fast, technical and could dribble well, it was always the easy thing to label me just a winger and have me stick to that<br /><br />At seven, I played centre-back. When you’re so young, though, it’s more to enjoy the training and to get a feel for the game. It’s not heavy on tactics of a position. We were playing on a half pitch, seven against seven or eight against eight, so they say you’re a centre-back, but it’s not like the real definition. At Under-11/12, I was playing as a right-back. The manager then was Cyril Helstone and he said to me ‘no, you’re not a defender. You should be in midfield’. That was the big change in my career because from that moment until I made my debut in the first-team at Feyenoord, that was the position I played.<br /><br />Gertjan Verbeek came in and I was still in the middle, it was my third season, but he wanted to play on the right side as a winger. I performed well there so they didn’t want to move me out, but in my mind, I always believed I was better in midfield. I was just happy to be playing, though, because I was young. When you’re still developing, getting games is so important. I learnt a lot playing on the wing and now I understand what the guys in those positions want from me. But when I got older, I knew I wanted to be a midfielder. I’ve had to have discussions with my agent, managers, directors, chief executives to explain that I am a midfielder, especially at Feyenoord.<br /><br />In my last season, I played on the right wing and a little bit on the left, but after the winter break, Mario Been was the trainer at that time, and he put me in the No.10 position. It went very well and I was lucky, because he was also a midfielder and helped me develop with lots of special advice about what is needed for the role. He guided me through it and before the winter break I had four goals, and afterwards I got 10 with his assistance. That was a sign for the people at Feyenoord, but also others that I was better as a No.10 than as a winger<br /><br />If you’re a winger, you’re busy with yourself. You have to make an action: dribble, or cross, or cut in. When you’re in midfield, you are the link in the team between the defence and the attack - the connection point for everything. You have to play thinking about not just what you have to do, but how it will effect those in front, behind and to the side of you. It’s a big responsibility, but it’s what I really enjoy and it suits my qualities more. I think the main reason why managers wanted to play me as a winger and not a midfielder is because I was dribbling a lot and enjoying the attacking freedom, so maybe they felt it was a risk to put a ‘tricky player’ in the middle. If you have to take on defenders often, of course, there’s a higher chance of you losing the ball. So they saw me as an exciting, individual player rather than one who could think of the whole team, but that is because when you’re out wide, you have to make things happen on your own mostly instead of helping others make things happen<br /><br />A lot of people see me differently, a lot didn’t think I could play the way I am now. They thought I was just an attack-minded player, the dribbler or the goalscorer without the discipline to defend and check on the movements of my team-mates. I think I’ve surprised many people because I’m showing I can still make the runs and get goals, but I’m regaining balls, keeping the rhythm in the passing, covering for those around me and getting assists - they’re seeing the complete version of me. How I’m playing is exactly what was discussed with the manager in the summer and a big part of it is just to be in tune with what’s happening in the team.<br /><br />I’m playing on the left of midfield and we have <b>[James]</b> Milner at left-back, who also has to get forward a lot. So I have to notice and understand his movements and also that of the players alongside me and just to the front and back. I have to have a clear idea of what is going on around me and make the best decision for the team. I’ve got the permission to break forward from the manager, but as much as I like to, sometimes it’s not always possible given the situations in the game. I have to say, I’ve grown better and better as the season has gone on because with time, you learn exactly the kind of space your team-mates will be in, the passes they like, the runs they will make.<br /><br />In the beginning I knew most of the players from facing them as the opposition, but I didn’t know how their qualities and mine needed to mix. That comes from training and playing together so the relationship on the pitch grows and I believe we’re just going to get better at it. He wants me to get into the box more, because he knows I’ve got the quality to get goals and affect the attacking play, so hopefully I get more chances in games to do that<br /><br />The place where I come from, you have to be hard and tough to be someone. When you play on the street, you have to fight for your chance to get a game. You have to make your voice heard and make people respect you otherwise they see you as a joke if you don’t state your opinion on anything - a foul or whatever. I had several times where it was my turn to play and you’d get another guy saying, ‘no it’s mine’. In that situation, you had to stand your ground, to be assertive. I learnt that in Rotterdam and still have that toughness in me today when I play<br /><br />It’s easier in the bigger games when both teams are dedicated to going for it, taking the initiative and trying to win. That allows you more space to play and because we’ve been so spot on collectively in these games, it makes it easier to then shine as an individual. I’ve got goals and assists against our biggest competitors this season, but it’s as a result of the team. We’ve got many big-game players and I think we’re a side that can bring our very best in these type of challenges. It makes you happy, but it also then makes you sad when you lose a lot of points against the other teams. I believe that if we can do so good against our rivals, then we definitely can do it in the other matches as we showed at the start of the season<br /><br />You can feel the difference in these games compared to the big ones. You can feel it with the crowd, the expectation is more than before, they are anxious because we haven’t performed against the lower teams. So when there’s a missed chance or something, then there’s this change in the stadium, the opponents feed on it as well, it encourages them. We’re only human, so of course you notice and feel it. It’s normal for Liverpool fans to have high expectations, because this is a big club - one of the best in the world, so we as a team have to deal with this problem, because only we can change it. We have to be positive and know we have the quality to get the results against anyone. If something is not working out in a game, we have to stay faithful to our way and not get frustrated. We proved we can do it in the first half of the season, so it’s not like we’re not capable of it.<br /><br />When it’s difficult, when teams drop and have no intention to play only to stop you, you have to enjoy this challenge. Don’t think ‘this is not what we want’, but rather enjoy that you have to find ways to create opportunities. You have to think ‘okay, they want to play this way, but we’re still going to score goals, we’re still going to fight for the points’. I think we have to look it at more that way, than ‘oh no, here we go, not this game again’. Almost every team is going to do that against us, so we have to accept that and make sure we beat it.</p>

  <p><b>[Gini Wijnaldum celebrates Liverpool’s ‘fantastic’ vision for young players]</b> When I met Pep with Jurgen and spoke to him, he explained to me the club’s vision for the youth and giving them the chance to train and learn from the first team. I was really happy about this, because it is important for clubs to grow their own players. The players who train with us now are really talented and it’s fantastic that they have the opportunity to improve themselves and see what it takes to be a player of the first team.<br /><br />I must say, it’s much easier to reach the first team in Holland than it is in England, especially if you play for a big club. Here in the Premier League, every side has money to buy players so my impression is that they don’t really look at youth, because they can just pay for the one who can do the job immediately. In England, there’s a pressure to buy players for now and not think so much about later. In Holland, they don’t have the money to compete to buy the top players to make a difference immediately, so they create good players by giving youth the chance to play in the first team. I think it’s already a positive thing if you reach the first team in England, especially at a top club, because of how difficult it is<br /><br />When I see a young player come in to Melwood and speak to them about how old they are, how the early stages of their career is going so far and what they would like to achieve, I always think back to my own experience. It reminds you of what point you were in your development then, what were the challenges and the lessons so it helps when you give advice. What I like about them, is that when you speak to them, they really listen. They are hungry for advice and it reminds me that now that I am one of the older players having to speak to them and teach them. I still enjoy football like I’m a kid though; I enjoy all the challenges and that we can all express ourselves individually, but in a way that makes the team better. That will never change for me and I hope the young players never lose that feeling too</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino may have seen Mohamed Salah steal the limelight at Liverpool this season]</b> He has something extra. He scores goals but he is like an extra defender - he is always making it difficult for players when they have the ball. They never see him coming. He takes the ball from behind. When you play against him you always have to be aware that he can be somewhere, you never know where he is. That doesn’t give you a comfortable feeling when you have the ball. And that’s a good thing for us<br /><br />Bobby is a really important player for us. It’s a good sign from the club, that we want to keep players together, and also a good sign from him; he wants to stay at Liverpool, he wants to build something with Liverpool<br /><br />I really think about it. We’re so close, it’s almost impossible not to think about it. Instead of letting it put pressure on me, I have to see it as motivation - we are just 90 minutes away from the final and we have to do everything to go through. So I use it as motivation instead of pressure. I enjoy the moment and the situations I’m in because they’re not normal situations. A lot of players don’t ever play in those situations and atmospheres - big games, semi-finals, the Champions League. So I just try to enjoy it.</p>

  <p><b>[Wijnaldum expects Liverpool to seize their Champions League chance in Rome]</b> I don’t ever have a problem with that. I feel good. Relaxed.<br /><br />I think we had to be glad at the time. There was a little bit of disappointment but if someone had said from the beginning would we take a 5-2 win over Rome I think everyone would say yes! It’s basically like the game against Manchester City, we had three goals in that and we were happy with that so why can’t we be happy now?<br /><br />We always have confidence we can score. That’s the way we play. We have confidence but every game is different. Some days you don’t score but then you have to make sure you don’t concede. That is what we have to do<br /><br />I think it is a warning. But I think there was also a warning from us with the way we played against City. We didn’t play the game to not concede, to not lose the game, we played to win. That is why we won and that is what we are going to do on Wednesday as well. I don’t think they will do something different. <b>[Against Barcelona]</b> they showed they didn’t change their style, they played with high pressing trying to score goals even when they knew if they conceded a goal it would be more difficult. I think they will do the same against us. But. They have to be aware we have good players up front, players who can score goals<br /><br />It is great! As a player, I have this feeling, and I think every player thinks this, that I am responsible for how my team-mates feel. I just want to do my best and give 100 per cent and if I do that they will feel better and think ‘I will give 100%’. This is what we have right now. We are really attached to each other and we share the same emotions. We have a really close team<br /><br />It was not difficult to come on, as such. You are focused and you want to play in the game. You are disappointed to be on the bench and you have to show why you have to play. The most difficult thing about coming on was because Ox was injured. You don’t wish someone injury, because anyone can be in that situation. I had a situation where I was out for seven months and that was not nice. It was not nice to see Ox’s injury and to hear afterwards about his scan. That was difficult for everybody<br /><br />At the beginning of the season you want to do as well as possible. We said we will see what we have to deal with and see how far we can come. We are now so close that you can go to the final and try to win it but at the beginning of the season, I didn’t really think about it. This is my first season in the Champions League and I didn’t know what to expect or how difficult it was. Now I see it is a really hard competition to win; you play against really good teams and the further you go the more difficult it is<br /><br />Coming here changed me. Now I think I am a more rounded player, I have to do more for the team - but every player still wants to score goals!<br /><br /><b>[One on Wednesday would write Wijnaldum’s name into Anfield folklore, but he says he’d take a boring 0-0 if necessary]</b> We just have to deal with the occasion</p>

For a lot of us it will be the first time in the final, so I’m really excited to play.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the idea of writing a new chapter in the club’s illustrious history]</b> That’s what makes it more exciting. You can put yourself there with legends that won the Champions League. That’s what everyone wants. That is what makes it really exciting for us because we have the opportunity now to win a big trophy with a massive club, who have been waiting for a lot of years for a trophy. We are lucky that we can give them one if we win<br /><br />Of course! Because it was a really intense season. As a player you want a little bit of rest, so we will get the rest we need. We will also train hard to stay in shape and to prepare ourselves for Real Madrid<br /><br />To be fair it’s difficult to not think about it because everyone is talking about the final! Even before this game, nobody is talking about this game. When you see people, they were wishing me luck for the final, they didn’t wish me luck for Brighton! Everyone reminds you that you’re going to play a final. Even if you don’t want to think about it, people remind you that you’re going to play a final so you will think about it, it’s inevitable<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum is in no mood to play down his side’s chances]</b> Of course <b>[we believe]</b>. Because we got results in difficult games in the Champions League and in the Premier League. That gives us a lot of confidence. <b>[Real have]</b> good players, good team. They are really professional, this is their third final in three years so that says a lot about that team. They are used to playing in games like this. It’s going to be difficult but I think that’s something we can deal with. The only thing we have to do is play our own game and not be nervous. I think then we will have a chance to win the game</p>

I don’t know how many years they have been doing it, how many years they have been first and second in the Ballon d’Or, it is unbelievable. <b>[Antoine]</b> Griezmann is another player you can say is there with Ronaldo and Messi, but it is difficult to say. What I do know is that a player has to do it for many more years to compete with those two because what they are doing is unbelievable. I don’t think you will ever see players who are so consistent, playing the way they are doing - scoring goals, being important for their club, winning trophies and individual trophies.<br /><br />He <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is really good and he showed it, even in the times when people said he wasn’t in good form. He still scored goals and helped Real win games. He will always be a threat, for every team he plays against, because he has already showed everything and that will also give Real confidence because, even if he is not in form, he can be dangerous. If I look at Real Madrid as a team, I see a lot of good players. That is why we have to be aware of everyone. They have so many good players, so much quality, almost all of them are world-class players. It is not only Ronaldo. Even if you take Ronaldo out, you have to manage to defend against the other players because they have a lot of quality where they can create chances or score goals. You have <b>[Toni]</b> Kroos, Marcelo, <b>[Sergio]</b> Ramos at set pieces. A lot of them can make the difference. It is not only our front three, midfield or the defenders – I think we have to do it as a team and I think we have to play the perfect game to win it</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum has admitted that the big blow of losing Mohamed Salah to injury contributed to Liverpool’s struggles in the Champions League final]</b> With Mo Salah we are a better team. <b>[He makes it]</b> easier for the other players in midfield and up front and also the defence, because defensively they have to think of him because he’s a really dangerous player. When he went out it was one problem less for them, so I think it helped them and it didn’t help us. We started well, the first 30-35 minutes I think we did a great job and stopped them from playing and everything. We created a few possibilities to score a goal, but I think after the injury of Mo it was really difficult for us. It was a big blow for the team, but we still managed to go to half-time at 0-0. Then in the second half, we were 1-0 behind. We came back really quick and then a wonderful goal from Bale, and then the third goal was really hard for us.<br /><br />Yes of course I’m proud of what we achieved, of how we came to the final, but if you come to the final you want to win it and the farther you come in the tournament the bigger the disappointment will be - especially in the final, if you lose it the disappointment is really big. I’m really devastated, but if you compare it to what we did this season, I think we can be proud that we came to the final and hopefully we learn off it and take it to next season</p>

  <p><b>[Wijnaldum laughs off Liverpool exit talk as he targets ‘special’ campaign at Anfield]</b> That was the speculation of the media. I laugh about it! I also read that I asked the club if I could leave. I never had a conversation with the club! People from the outside just see Liverpool are buying players, so <b>[they think]</b> players who are already here are going to leave. Liverpool will always buy good players, even if they already have good players. That’s normal. I think it has to be normal for a club like Liverpool because that means you’re a big club. But that was something from the media that I was going to Turkey. Maybe because Phillip Cocu is manager and I worked with him for two years. I don’t know who put it in the media, but it wasn’t me!<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum rejects the idea that the arrivals of Keita and Fabinho puts extra pressure on the likes of himself to perform]</b> To be fair, I don’t think like this. I always try to perform and not because you have players on the bench or on the pitch that can play in your position. I think it’s quite normal. It has to be normal at a club like Liverpool - a club that will always buy players, even if they already have good players. I always want to play. I think that kind of competition, you have to get it in a team like Liverpool. I think Manchester City and Chelsea, with the new signings that they’ve made, have it also. I think in each position there is competition and it’s good at Liverpool. Back in the day it was not different. If you see that there’s a player and you play for a big team, you just have to do your best for the manager<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum believes his side are capable of pushing Pep Guardiola’s men hard]</b> We will see. I think we have the quality to compete with them but I also thought we had the quality last season. If City’s going to play like they did last season then it will be really hard because they only lost two games and had a few draws. If you want to compete with them you can barely drop points. That’s really difficult but something we look forward to because you want to compete with the others and City is one of the best. So we will go for it. We feel that we can do something special. We felt it last year also. But feeling is one thing, doing it is the second one. We will work hard to achieve great things in the season. That’s what we’re going to try</p>

  <p><b>[Gini Wijnaldum says that his Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah is more than equipped to handle the pressure]</b> It’s easy to say <b>[he’s not in form]</b>.

He played good.’ But now he is not scoring and people are saying he is in a difficult situation. I don’t see it that way. He still works hard, he still creates chances.<br /><br />If anyone can deal with pressure, it is Mo. Last season he had pressure when people were saying he had to be the top scorer of the league. Mo is not someone that is scared of pressure. He embraces the pressure. He knows that he can do it.<br /><br />I told him I expect more hat-tricks this season, last year there was only one, and he said I was right. I told him: ‘Mo, you are a top player. If you look at Messi and Ronaldo they score a lot of hat-tricks - you have to do the same if you want to compete with them’.</p>

Before I signed for Liverpool I was playing for Newcastle as a No. 10 - basically, I was always attacking, I didn’t have to do much defensive work, I didn’t play as the No. 6 or the No. 8. Learning to play different roles has made me a more all-round midfielder. With the calibre of players here and the technical staff, this is a great environment to learn. Walking out at Anfield is an unbelievable experience and I feel very fortunate. I try to enjoy every minute of it. We’ve come a long way as a club and I’ve been happy to contribute to that</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum believes a positional tweak at Liverpool has gone quite well]</b> When I spoke to the manager here he said to me that we don’t really play with a No. 10, that we play with two No. 8s and that I would be one of the eights. But I think the manager got to know me way better during the first season. You train every day, you see each other every day. In the No. 6 position we had Jordan Henderson and Emre Can and Kevin Stewart, so we had a few players there. But in my second season he said: ‘I think you can play No. 6 also and we might use you there in some games, so be prepared’. So, during training I was playing there sometimes and during the pre-season games in Hong Kong I played there, but in actual games I only played there twice, against Manchester City and Everton I think. This season I’ve played there quite a lot and it’s gone quite well. I enjoy it.<br /><br />People were trying to get me off thinking that I’m a midfielder, and trying to put in my head that I was a winger. There were loads of managers who said: ‘You have to concentrate on being a winger because you have more potential there’. But I was like: ‘You can say what you want, but I’m a midfielder and I know what’s the best for me’. So, I just focused on midfield, and look where I am today. I was full of confidence in myself that I would reach the top or be a professional player as a midfielder</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum has hailed Frenkie de Jong’s impact on the Netherlands team]</b> With his dribbles he always ensures there is a good connection from defence to midfield and from midfield to attack. He is always able to create space because he is a) always available and b) with his actions he creates many situations: he forces opponents to choose, they have to come out of position, lose their marker, which can automatically make space or give us a free man. That makes it easier for me to play football. I am someone who naturally likes to move. With Frenkie, I can play much more in the possession, so that in certain situations I also get closer to the opponent’s goal. The goals against Germany and France are good examples. I can get there on time now, whereas it was much more difficult for me, because I played a controlling role.<br /><br /><b>[He is]</b> so good and special that in Netherlands you don’t hear anyone say he must play faster when he starts dribbling. I find that special. I know, the ball is always faster, but sometimes you have to let players dribble to make a difference. Now young players get to hear that they are taking it too far, while I think: ‘No, let them develop it!’ Why do you think we were able to play that stiff French team from time to time? That has to do with the skills of the Dutch players. If you have that in your team, that’s a blessing.<br /><br />In the 5-3-2 system I had a controlling job alongside Kevin Strootman. In itself it’s no problem, but you depend on what is happening around you. With a bit of shuffling it becomes a 3-4-3, which is already a lot more attacking. The only problem is that you basically defend very close to your own half and that the spaces are in front, but you can’t always get there very quickly. Now we play with three midfielders, one of whom is a holder and two in an attacker role. That suits me much better, while Frenkie de Jong ensures that we also play better as a team</p>

He deserved that chance to play and the fact he scored and gave us the three points makes it even more beautiful. Every player in this squad is important. If a defender goes out we have another top defender who can step in. It’s the same in midfield and attack. When Divock came on he showed his pace straightaway with that run down the line.

He has helped us a lot and I hope he can perform until the end of the season and continue making important saves for us. He already gave us confidence he is a good goalkeeper. It is always difficult to stop balls; for example the one against Everton <b>[from Andre Gomes]</b>, if that one had gone in no-one would have blamed him but he saved it. Against Napoli also it was difficult to stop that ball but he managed to stop it and we are happy so of course it gives confidence<br /><br />But it also gave us confidence when Loris <b>[Karius]</b> was goalkeeper and Simon Mignolet.

Last season with the same players they finished second. One season goes well, one season a little bit more difficult.

If a midfielder playing elsewhere has a great season, there’s a good chance that Liverpool will try to sign him. That’s just the way it is. There is no point worrying about who might come in and take your place, you just have to focus on your own job and doing the best you can every day. Every top club wants to keep progressing. It suits a club like Liverpool to have a big squad because it’s one of the biggest in Europe. If you look at the amount of games we’re playing, you can’t just have a squad of 18 players. You won’t make it to the finish fit and fresh. Keita and Fabinho are both quality players who are helping take the team forward and I’m happy they’re here.

I don’t see a big difference between Newcastle-Sunderland and Liverpool-Everton. In the derby, their fans expect a lot from the players, they will support the players on the pitch. It’s a different game, separate from all the other ones. <b>[The atmosphere]</b> is nice. You use it to spur you on. It’s great to win there. My first year we won there.

All of the teams have gone through to the next round, and for us of course it was really good because we managed to win an away game at Bayern Munich - which is quite difficult. I feel like we’ve taken a really big step, because a lot of people said after the first match that it was not a good result to play a 0-0, but we had a good feeling about it because we didn’t concede a goal. We know the way we’re playing, we can always create chances so we were quite confident we would create chances here and score goals. That says something about the team itself. A lot of teams struggle here to get a result, but we still did it. We have a lot of confidence but we also work hard to bring things together in a good way</p>

  <p><b>[The meteoric rise of Virgil van Dijk has come as no surprise to Georginio Wijnaldum]</b> I already saw it <b>[coming]</b>. I had thought about it because I play with him for the national team, I had seen him make steps and progress a lot during the years. He has had a big impact since he came in and has helped the team a lot, so I think he was a really good signing for us. He is a big character, a person everyone loves. Everyone loves him in the dressing room, at Melwood and the fans love him. We’ve made a step forward with Virgil in the team.<br /><br />It is really important because we can score in different situations; we can score from set-pieces, we can score from good football, we can score from counter-attacks, we have all different kinds of qualities that can help us to score goals. It gives more confidence to the team because it gives us more opportunities to score. In the last few games, we’ve scored quite a lot with the set-pieces - and Virgil is a happy man because he’s scored a few! It is good if you have those qualities and you’re aware of them. We’re aware of our qualities we have, so we try to use them in every game. It is really important and it helps the team, but it doesn’t matter who scores or who plays good, it is just good if someone scores. Most of the time it is the front three, but now also Virgil is scoring, Trent <b>[<a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b> can score and Robbo <b>[Andy Robertson]</b> is getting closer.

Ninety-seven points, we’d normally be champion with. But in this case, City had one point more and they turned champions. Overall, I think we had a good season and now is the challenge to finish with a title to make the season complete.

They won also, so fair enough that they are champions. But now we have a game that we can control, so we have to bring that to a good end.

I never really had that dream. Now you have even children watching the Champions League final every year, they live and breathe it, but I probably never even looked at them when I was a kid.

The good side is if you can play everywhere, it’s easier for a manager to put you in the team. He knows you can help the side out. Look at <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, he can play everywhere. If we need a left-back, he plays there, right-back, midfield. I think he could probably stand in goal even!

Nothing bad in that. That is his opinion. In his opinion Sadio is a diver. What can you say about that? I didn’t see the Villa one back <b>[when Mane was booked for diving]</b>, so it’s difficult to give my opinion on that, but I can’t remember Sadio doing it before. Now we have VAR as well, so…How many players of ours have had a yellow card for diving? Sadio was the first, I think? So to say that we are divers, I think it’s a little bit strange. That’s my opinion<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum was in no mood to speculate on how Sunday’s game might play out]</b> Maybe they will play different. I think it suits every team if it is a more open game, but it is also a sign of respect if they play differently<br /><br /><b>[Since the start of 2019, they have come from behind to win valuable points in seven different games]</b> That’s something we changed in the last few years.

We always have that feeling, to stay positive. That’s also because of the results we had until now, and the way we came back. Our mindset is different, which is quite good, because we keep doing the things we want to do in a game. Normally if you are 2-0 down, your body language is going to change, but we still have that mindset that we can still turn it around. It’s because of the belief we have in each other, but also the results we have had. If it just happened once, it’s not the same. But it happened over and over.

You have to go until the end, and you have to go even when you don’t physically see a positive outcome. Especially at the end of the games, you just keep going because you think you can. Your body is tired and so you battle with your body like ‘no, we have to go, we have to go on’. It’s really hard, but in the end you enjoy it more if you win that way than if it is easy</p>

You can laugh with him, you can talk with him, I’m really happy to have him as a team-mate.<br /><br /><b>[Another key component in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title-chasing side is commanding centre-half <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>]</b> Really good, also because he is a really funny person. I worked with him at the national team, played with him, so I already knew which kind of player he was. And I knew that when he came he could transform the back line, but also the line in front of him. So the midfielders. The way he puts everyone in their position helps the whole team, so he’s a leader in that way.</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> makes sure everyone keeps their feet on the ground]</b> Nobody <b>[here]</b> will say that it’s difficult to have the focus on one game at a time. You just want to do it as well as possible. We also have a manager who puts us with both feet on the ground when we have a moment when we’re not concentrated on something like that. We also have a team that wants to be as successful as possible. For that, you need 100 per cent concentration and give effort every time on the pitch. Off the pitch, when you need treatment and those things, everyone is busy with doing as good as possible. That’s what helps us and we help each other and try to keep each other sharp. I think that’s why we have the run we have right now because we are just focused on doing even better than before<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum is expecting another testing examination against <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a>]</b> It’s going to be a difficult game. When we played away it was already a difficult game - they dropped deep, they made it difficult for us to play our football. I think they’re going to try to do that again. Every situation is different, we just have to deal with the situation we will be in at that moment</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Wijnaldum plans to finish career in Netherlands]</b> In the future I see myself playing for Feyenoord, <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> or Sparta again. Sometimes I look at Sparta (his first youth club) and think ‘it would be great to spend my last years as a professional there’. In the Netherlands I played for three clubs and still have a good feeling about all three of them. But you can only pick one.<br /><br />I can’t promise anything though. I learn from other players too. <b>[Ruud]</b> Van Nistelrooy once promised to come back, but changed his mind over the years.<br /><br />It’s unique what I’m experiencing right now. You want to play at the highest level and win trophies, like <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Clarence Seedorf</a>. It’s my dream to play as long as possible.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star Wijnaldum says he’s become a more ‘complete player’ under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s stewardship]</b> My development since I came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has been good. I have become more of an all-round player. I was used to playing in a very attacking role and only in attack. Since the World Cup with <b>[Louis]</b> <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">van Gaal</a> <b>[in 2014]</b>, I have had a more controlling role in midfield and that went well. After that, I didn’t play that role again, at <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> or <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. When I spoke with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, he saw me in a more defensive role, where I needed to be an all-rounder. It’s not always easy as I am used to attacking, but it has helped in my development. I am a more complete player now than I was when I arrived<br /><br />The manager has had a big influence on me. He has brought the club back to where it used to be and he brought his vision to the club, and I have to say his vision fits the club. The players adore him, of course, because he cares about the players and he is a good coach, a coach who improves his players and he is a great person to work with. We have also had a lot of personal conversations and he has become a really important person to me. He knows a lot of things about me that other coaches don’t know. We have a really good player-coach relationship, as well as on a personal level. He is an important person to me in general</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Wijnaldum reveals reason behind shirt number]</b> Number five is a really special number for me. It was my lucky number when I was young but also because my favourite player, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, was playing with number five. I was really happy that I could start my professional career as number five. Since then I’ve played with number five at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and when I came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the club basically kept number five for me. I was really happy with that<br /><br />The toughest opponent I ever played against was Andres Guardado. There was a game at the World Cup against Mexico, it was really hot and he was my opponent that day. It was a really hot day and he just kept running! It was really difficult for me, and besides that, he’s also a really good football player. On the ball, he was really great. It was a big thing for me to stop him. Because it was so hot, it was more difficult than normal, but at the end, we still won the game</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum admits <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> can be annoying]</b> I’ve played with a few players who have great leadership, I have to say Kevin Strootman and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> were, I think, above the other ones. Mark Van Bommel was also a good leader and a good captain, but out of the three of them, I have to chose Henderson. It can be annoying <b>[when he is motivating players on the pitch]</b>, but if you think about why he’s doing it, it’s only to help you as a person and the team so if you think about it in that way, you always appreciate it so we are really happy with the way Henderson is<br /><br /><b>[Henderson is not the only role model that Wijnaldum is looking to take important lessons from at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> engine is unbelievable.

He’s non-stop, I have to say when you play against him, it’s really tough because Milner is the type of player who will never stop giving everything so you always have to be 100 per cent concentrated and have to give every time 100 per cent otherwise you will lose from him.
