  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum speaks about one of his childhood interests before football]</b> I wanted to be a gymnast when I was young, I used to do back-flips and all those things in the streeet and at home, but my grandma said it was dangerous and made me stop. Now my daughter is doing gymnastics and I’m a little bit jealous of her because she is doing all the things I wanted to do when I was young. I had to stop and concentrate on football but I’m happy about that now</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum says Liverpool evolved over the course of the 2018-19 season]</b> We have evolved a lot. You can see it not only with the results but also with the way we were playing. We grew during the season. We started really well and we managed to win difficult games where in the past it was quite difficult and if we didn’t play really well we didn’t win the games that were really tough. But this season we managed to win those games. We learned a lot. Everyone is a better player than they were before.<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk was voted PFA Player of the Year for his imperious form, and Wijnaldum has been in awe of his fellow countryman]</b> What has impressed me the most with Virgil is that he’s consistent, he barely makes a mistake. He developed really well at Celtic and Southampton and Liverpool, he developed a lot. What also impressed me is that other players play better when he plays; the defenders next to him defend better, the players in front of him play better because when you play and you know he’s behind you, you have a safe feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum has acknowledged that Liverpool’s Champions League triumph has made him realise just how far the club’s global reach extends]</b> It’s a really big club. Everywhere you go people know Liverpool. On my vacation, a lot of people came to me and congratulated me for the Champions League. Sometimes you don’t realise how big the club is; the club is in Europe but even when you travel abroad to Asia or America you see how big this club is because a lot of people support Liverpool and a lot of people know the club<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum insists he is also ‘hungry’ for more success after lifting his first trophy in a Liverpool shirt]</b> Because I know how it feels right now, I want it again. That’s why I came back hungry, the guys also came back hungry to achieve even more. It’s a good feeling and it’s the feeling you want to get used to, winning trophies like that. That’s why everyone is hungry to do even better this year and win more</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum is unfazed by a lack of transfer activity at Liverpool. When quizzed on recruitment at Anfield]</b> It’s always difficult to say. You have to look at how the season would go, if it goes well then people will not talk about it, if it doesn’t then people will say we had to sign new players. Until now it has gone well, a few players who were injured have returned to the team. That feels like new already. It’s for Liverpool to sign players or to decide that we don’t have to sign players. We just have to do our work on the pitch<br /><br />That’s what you have at a big club like Liverpool. I don’t think it will be different at other big clubs, it’s a good sign<br /><br /><b>[He added on 19-year-old frontman Rhian Brewster, who could fill the void created by Daniel Sturridge’s departure at the end of his contract]</b> We all know what his qualities are, he is a good player. We knew that before he got injured but now he has had a really good impact in pre-season so far. Hopefully he can stay fit and help the team to go further. What we are trying to do now is make the players ready when they get the chance. They train as much as possible with us, we are trying to help them learn. When the chance comes they must be ready</p>

  <p><b>[Gini Wijnaldum still on a high after Liverpool’s Champions League final success]</b> Yeah, I like to fly a lot. That’s my life<br /><br /><b>[Wherever Wijnaldum goes, people want to talk. Not about the Reds’ Premier League misfortune, not about the Netherlands’ footballing renaissance or his holidays or his family]</b> It’s been a big difference to previous summers. I’ve had a few more people congratulating me and wanting to talk. Everywhere you go, every day, everyone reminds you, everyone wants to speak about it. They all want to talk about how we won it six times, and how they felt. You can’t avoid that<br /><br /><b>[Still, Klopp is not averse to a little look back himself, as Wijnaldum reveals]</b> He sent me a video over the summer! It was one which starts where we lost the final in Kiev, and it shows our progress from there. It was good to watch and remember all those moments and those games<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum admits that feeling, beating Tottenham at the Wanda Metropolitano and then celebrating in front of 500,000 fans in Liverpool the following day, was like a drug]</b> Now we know what it’s like to win something. And not only that, to celebrate with the city as well. It’s not just the team and the people who work here, it’s the supporters, the city. It felt like the whole world was happy when we won it! You get a feeling that you are not only doing it for yourself, you’re making so many people happy and that’s probably the biggest drug for a player. It changes your life, because you’ll always be a Champions League winner. There are a lot of great players who didn’t win that trophy, so it’s special. It’s the biggest one you can win as a club, because you are competing with the biggest clubs. All around the world, everyone is watching the Champions League. When I speak to people, they don’t tell me how disappointed they were not to win the Premier League, they want to talk about the Champions League. But we wanted to win both! That’s how we look at it. But winning the Champions League, yeah, you will always be remembered as legends<br /><br /><b>[In terms of the Premier League, Liverpool’s focus remains sharp. Manchester City, champions in each of the last two seasons, will start the new campaign as favourites once more]</b> I think it’s about consistency. In the Premier League, it is so difficult to collect the amount of points we did last season. And City did it twice! So that’s the challenge we have. But we have a team that can do it, and we want to try and do better than last year. Hopefully we can bring more titles to Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool already house the PFA Player of the Year in Virgil van Dijk, and have three big contenders for the prestigious Ballon d’Or award too]</b> He deserves to be in the running. But I also think Sadio Mane and Alisson Becker do too! I don’t know how many Golden Gloves Alisson has, but it’s a lot! It’s difficult to say. I don’t know what they are looking for, it’s an award for the best player, but a lot of the time the best player is the one who won the most, so we will see. But any of those three would deserve it</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum has heralded the strength of Liverpool’s squad and does not believe their quiet transfer window should be assessed yet]</b> We have to see. We have a good group now who have played together for a few years, we’re already strong. When you sign players, sometimes they need time to settle in. I had it, <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson had it, Fabinho had it, <b>[Naby]</b> Keita had it. There’s no guarantee when you sign a player that he can play immediately the way we want him to play. But we have to see. People will say, ‘You needed a signing’ if the season does not go well, but if it goes well, they will say we did not need a signing. We will see how it goes. We have players who were injured coming back from injury, so the squad is already bigger and better than last season<br /><br />I like it. They push us to be even better, we push them to be even better. I think that’s why last season we both had a lot of points. When you look at each other, you know that you have to perform because otherwise the other team will walk away <b>[with the title]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Gini Wijnaldum has revealed how Jurgen Klopp gave a pre-Champions League final meeting in Cristiano Ronaldo underpants prior to their 2018 clash with Real Madrid]</b> We saw he was wearing the boxer shorts of Cristiano Ronaldo. He did the meeting with his shirt stuffed inside his ‘CR7’ boxers. The whole changing room was on the floor laughing their heads off. That really broke the ice. Usually in those situations, everyone is serious and concentrated. But he was relaxed and made this joke. He’s done hundreds of jokes likes that. If you see that your manager is really confident and relaxed, it will have an effect on players. He is a father figure in those things for the players. With his jokes and his body language, he takes the pressure off players<br /><br /><b>[And Wijnaldum talked about the special relationship the former Dortmund boss has with his players]</b> When I have problems I can always go to the manager. I can text him a few days before and ask if he has a minute for me. He is always curious about what it is. ‘Is it something bad, good? What is it?’. He always tries to empathise with the other person, to feel what they’re going through. He is a really special man for me. I see him as more than a manager - a really good friend. Everyone asks me how he is as a person. ‘Is it fake what he does on the sidelines?’ No, that is how he is. Even in training he is the same. That’s how he is.<br /><br /><b>[The former Newcastle United midfielder also gave an insight into how Klopp managed to keep his players focused during their remarkable 2018-19 campaign]</b> On the inside, he is totally the same as before. He is always honest and makes sure that we don’t want to fly. He tries to keep us with both feet on the ground. At the beginning of the season, when we were winning games, he was sometimes angry and mad at us because we were not 100 per cent focused. He was like, ‘Do everything right, work right, put in 100%. That is what brings us here. Every slip will let it go, it can be the other side again.’ He kept us with both feet at the ground. <br /><br />That is Jurgen. It was a good thing for us to see. He didn’t change after the good results that we had. As players, you sometimes have that much confidence that you say, ‘We will be all right.’ He always says, ‘You can’t manage what happens on the pitch, but you can prepare us as well as possible’. Now, when we slip a little bit and think things will work with 95% or so, he is there to knock us down. ‘One-hundred per cent - or you have nothing. We have to do it that way, that is what brought us here. That is how we have to continue.’ That’s one of the reasons why we had a good season last year. Everyone stays focused, even in training</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum says Liverpool’s experience is helping them win games early in the season]</b> It is encouraging that we are getting results without being in top form. It is important, especially at this time of the season, that you collect as many points as possible because basically, you have to improve during the season and that is what are trying to do and what we want to do. But it is also important to collect as many as points until you are at your best. It is really important that we have won the game at Southampton. But I don’t think you always see a team play well for 90 minutes. We just have to make sure we win games. Basically it doesn’t matter how you win games. You just have to learn and use that experience that you have because we won’t play a game 90 minutes counter pressing or everything goes well during a game. You have to use your quality and your experience and still try to win the game. That is more important than playing well over the whole 90 minutes because that is really impossible<br /><br /><b>[The Gunners have looked promising in parts of their wins over Newcastle and Burnley, with many tipping them to return to the top four this season]</b> It is difficult to say who will be up there. We must see how the season goes for them but also us. Everyone says we will finish first or second but we must still show it and perform at the end of the season. We have to make sure we deal with the situations and give everything we have. They made some good signings but they were always a good team</p>

I am sure he has the best interests at heart with every player in the squad. But sometimes you are so involved in a match and the manager is still chasing you. Then you just boil over sometimes - and, in my case, I do get angry with him. I still don’t know if what happened against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was his real plan.

Nothing bad in that. That is his opinion. In his opinion Sadio is a diver. What can you say about that? I didn’t see the Villa one back <b>[when Mane was booked for diving]</b>, so it’s difficult to give my opinion on that, but I can’t remember Sadio doing it before. Now we have VAR as well, so…How many players of ours have had a yellow card for diving? Sadio was the first, I think? So to say that we are divers, I think it’s a little bit strange. That’s my opinion<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum was in no mood to speculate on how Sunday’s game might play out]</b> Maybe they will play different. I think it suits every team if it is a more open game, but it is also a sign of respect if they play differently<br /><br /><b>[Since the start of 2019, they have come from behind to win valuable points in seven different games]</b> That’s something we changed in the last few years. A couple of years ago we were struggling to win games like we win them now, but we grew and learned a lot during the years. We just created that thing that we know we always can turn things around. We always have that feeling, to stay positive. That’s also because of the results we had until now, and the way we came back. Our mindset is different, which is quite good, because we keep doing the things we want to do in a game. Normally if you are 2-0 down, your body language is going to change, but we still have that mindset that we can still turn it around. It’s because of the belief we have in each other, but also the results we have had. If it just happened once, it’s not the same. But it happened over and over. We know we are a team that can always come back from difficult situations, but of course we don’t want to let it go that far!<br /><br /><b>[Asked if it was more physically and mentally demanding to win games that way]</b> It’s hard, really hard. You have to go until the end, and you have to go even when you don’t physically see a positive outcome. Especially at the end of the games, you just keep going because you think you can. Your body is tired and so you battle with your body like ‘no, we have to go, we have to go on’. It’s really hard, but in the end you enjoy it more if you win that way than if it is easy</p>

In the second half, we came out of the dressing room, started good and scored another one.<br /><br />It was 3-0 and then at the end, because we were tired, it was a little bit difficult and they were getting better in the game and this resulted in one goal for them. But at the end we played a very good game. They just grew in the game <b>[after <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s flying start]</b> and we tried to stop them with all we had. That’s what we did but you could still see that they have a lot of quality, so we did everything but sometimes they still came through our press. That’s the kind of team we were playing against but I think overall we did a tremendous job by playing the way we played in there and we can be proud of ourselves<br /><br /><b>[For many, the title is now <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s to lose - even with two-thirds of the season to come]</b> It’s always good if you have a gap between the teams behind you <b>[but]</b> you can see with last season that it means nothing because if you don’t perform and get the results you need to get, they can close the gap really quick. So what we have to do is just focus game by game and give our all and then at the end of the season, we will see where we are. But I think we just have to enjoy the moment we are in now, because we worked hard for it, and try to carry on</p>

  <p><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum says the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad are united in their ambition to win the Club World Cup]</b> I’m really looking forward to playing in the World Cup for teams because back in the day I saw the Champions League winners play in the competition. What I like the most is that if you win, you get a badge on your shirt. That’s something you want to achieve.<br /><br />That’s what makes this competition so special. First of all, it’s really difficult to qualify for a tournament like this. Second of all, you play against other teams who also had to do a lot of work to come into this competition. That’s why we have to enjoy it the most - because you never know if it’s going to be your last time in a competition like this. And, on the other side, if you want to play in this competition as much as possible you need to win the Champions League. It also gives you something in the Champions League. <br /><br />If you win the Champions League trophy you can play the World Cup for teams, so it also gives you another reason to want to win the Champions League. You go into football to make history and that’s what we want to achieve with the team we’re playing in. We have a good team. We are friends, we work hard for each other. We have a team that when we look back later we can say we achieved things. This will definitely be one of the moments when we look back, we can say we achieved something big<br /><br /><b>[Wijnaldum added on the importance of maintaining a winning mentality as the campaign progresses]</b> It’s really important because it gives you a lot of confidence. When you are losing games, pressure will come on the team; when you win games, instead of pressure, confidence will come. It’s always important to win games, or even play good games, because that will help you get more confidence</p>
