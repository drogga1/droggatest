  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard believes that his brother Eden Hazard is bringing the ‘wow’ factor to Chelsea this season]</b> Yes, everybody thinks Eden has the potential to become the world’s best player. But we have at the moment two <b>[exceptional]</b> players in Ronaldo and Messi. They are very strong so maybe Eden will have to wait a little bit until they stop or when they are really old! He could become the best - for me, he is already one of the best. I want to see him go third on the <b>[Ballon d’Or]</b> list one day soon and I think he’ll do it. I think a lot of people when they saw Eden playing, they go ‘wow what a player!’. He’s strong, but with the ball he is fast and has all the abilities of a great player. When I saw the game against Everton, I loved seeing him play like that - sometimes he is fantastic and that is the life for him.<br /><br />I like playing with the national team <b>[with my brother]</b>, it is great. For a long time Eden has shown me the right path in football and I try to follow him. I worked really hard in my club to get a chance in the national team with Eden. I hope now, as the little brother, I can aim for the same things as well in the national team, so I work hard. To have three brothers in the squad would be great, but I don’t feel the pressure from Eden. It is like this since I was 14 years old so it isn’t pressure, it is normal. We try to play good football - I like to play central. Eden can play more on the left or right side. Kylian can also play a bit more left or right, but for me I like to play central<br /><br />Look at me now though and I am also playing on the left side so, yes, we like to play in attack. This is the Hazard way! We try to score and we try to assist and be exciting. I think that he found a new way - a bit like when Chelsea were champions two years ago and Eden was also fantastic. Maybe he needed to change his position, change some things and Conte has found the solution and he is playing very well. Congratulations Conte!<br /><br />Maybe it was a mistake to want to continue, but he wanted to help the team because they needed him. Even when he was only 60%-70% he still played. Now, it is not an issue. The team play fantastic football. They have confidence and I can see them continuing to play very strongly this year - and Eden is more free and scoring more goals<br /><br />It depends how the coach sets up and which tactics they chose but I like to play central. I like to play No.10 or as a false nine. I can also play left and I can play right. For me, the most important thing is for me to play but I think my best position is near the goal. I like to be offensive, but sometimes when the team needs to defend and go back a little bit… then I like to also go back and help out<br /><br />It is a question of the system we chose when we face a team. Every game is different and I can be flexible. For the moment, the coach has me on the left side or right side, on the wings. We have a lot of freedom at the front and the coach says that we can go right, left or central. We swap positions and all the attacking players can change their positions. I think it is good also because we are difficult to mark. I like this club and I like this team</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard insists he is happy at Borussia Mönchengladbach]</b> For the moment, I feel good here. The Bundesliga is a good championship and for now, I want to stay here. In the future maybe I will be in England again. I hope I can end my career in Belgium, but at the moment I don’t think about the end of my career. I am happy here, my family is happy, we are next to Belgium with our family there and they feel perfect. It is the most important thing, if my family feel good then I feel good. I speak a bit of German and I am getting better every day. I am just at the beginning. I like German football, but England have a great championship too and a lot players want to play in England. It is also special, but for now I feel good here. A lot of journalists write things<br /><br />Sometimes it is wrong, sometimes it is true. Sometimes all the people think it is true. Sometimes people think it is a lie but this is the life of a footballer. It is okay for me because I have been in football since I was 14. I saw with Eden a lot of stories and I know it is not a problem <b>[for me]</b> to have this. A lot of things can happen, maybe I will be here, maybe I won’t and I could be in another club, who knows, but I hope I can continue to improve. I have improved every year since the beginning of my career. I hope I can <b>[continue]</b> do this also but maybe in five years I will be finished <b>[laughs]</b>! Hopefully not but you never know<br /><br />Leipzig are one of the best at the moment. Playing a very strong style of football, they have a lot of power but still play attractive football. They are second and I think that they deserve their position as they only came from the second league and did this. It is a good job and this year, maybe it is Bayern Munich versus Leipzig, but maybe next year it will be Mönchengladbach. We have quality in the team, we have a good team. Sometimes this season we played really well, but didn’t win the game.<br /><br />So sometimes football is a little bit about the luck and sometimes we haven’t had it this season. This is football and we need to continue to work and it will be okay, I think so anyway. In the Champions League we showed we are good team, but we lost to very good teams, of course. We proved that we are very good and I think that everyone knows that</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard thinks that his side should focus on the cup competitions ahead of their Europa League clash against Fiorentina]</b> The league is difficult for the moment <b>[for Gladbach]</b>, but we just want to win the next game. We have a place for Europa League up for grabs at the moment <b>[in the league]</b>. We are in the Europa League at the moment. That’s coming up and I hope that we can continue because it is a good target for the team and we could go far so I hope that we can do this. We have quality in the team, we have a good team. Sometimes this season we played really well, but didn’t win the game so sometimes football is a little bit about the luck and sometimes we haven’t had it this season.

We proved that we are very good and I think that everyone knows that<br /><br />I feel good, I play a lot of times. I started the season very well. The team didn’t get the results before and now we started the new year better with four points so I hope we can continue like this in the future. We have a new manager and new tactics and at the moment we are okay. I hope we keep getting better</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea player Thorgan Hazard is backing young Blues stars Andreas Christensen and Charly Musonda to make a big impact]</b> When he arrived everybody in the team and at the club were saying ‘wow’, what a defender, what a player. He can play football, he is strong, he is fast, he is intelligent and so he has helped us a lot and helped us get Champions League qualification. I think he has a great future and he can play at a top, top level at a top, top team. When a 19-year-old comes into defence like this and does this and I am very confident about his future. We have a good relationship and we played also at Chelsea for a month. We played in the youth team and trained together, but I didn’t realise until he came here that he was so good.<br /><br />First he came here and nobody knew who he was. He came in here, at 19 years old and when he played in the first game, it was difficult because it was against Dortmund. The team lost and it was difficult for him because then he didn’t play for two or three games. He wasn’t like he is now, he is a developing talent. There are a few players here who can speak his language like Jannik Vestergaard and Oscar Wendt which helps him. I think it is a club for young players and it is very good to come here. They give their opportunity also to play in a great club, great atmosphere and a great championship. Most of the guys are very good. It is a high level. You can see also with Christensen, Dahoud and Elvedi, but other guys too who are young players coming into the team this season. They help the team and learn<br /><br />Charly is a friend. He decided to go on loan to Betis and the first year he was fantastic for Charly. After that there was a change in the coach. They changed the trainer and sometimes they want to play with you and sometimes they don’t want to. So after he decided to return to Chelsea and he decided to take a place in the squad so I know Charly and I think he is a winner. He will fight for that and I hope he can do this <b>[play for Chelsea]</b>. I think he knows also that there are very good players in his position, so he needs to fight very, very hard. My brother, Willian and Pedro and it is a lot of players<br /><br />I think it is a good system that Chelsea have and they have a lot of young players who need to play. At Chelsea you have a very good team so it is difficult sometimes for the younger players. For that reason they go on loan, to develop them and after the first year on loan. I came here and sometimes the players will go back or sometimes they want to stay and play like me. There can be the opportunity to play in Chelsea, but you have to decide whether you need another year away <b>[at the end of every season]</b>. If the player thinks he is ready to go back to Chelsea then they will let you go. As we saw with me, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne. If you want to go - it is your decision. I am not sure, but I think it was the decision from those guys to go - as well as me away from Chelsea. But the system is very good for the player and it is good that they don’t block you and, if you want to go then go.</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard, who has replaced his brother Eden in the Belgium squad, says that Roberto Martinez is building something special with the Red Devils]</b> Yes, he changed things. It changed him also, we can play different systems now. We now play with three defenders. A little bit like Chelsea, also the same, and we are playing very well. We have won every game at the moment. I hope it will continue like this. It is an important game against Greece. I think Greece is second and we are first. I am happy that I can go with this team. It is true that it is the best team for a long time and to play with this team is good for me, to play with these players and train with these players. I can also learn <b>[on international duty]</b>, but first we need to qualify. We know from the last European Championship, it is not easy to get to the finals. You need to play well, be lucky, avoid injury so it is dependent on a lot of things so we will see.<br /><br />Yes, I think the team also learned from the World Cup in Brazil and the European Championship in France. I think it was a very young team in Brazil and France. We know the players now have more experience. Eden will be 27-years-old when the team plays in Russia and we will all be more experienced with the international level of competition. I think it is good for the team and it can help every player - who now all play at a high level in good leagues. We will be ready for Russia</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard could be heading back to join brother Eden in England]</b> England is appealing, but when you speak to players who play there, they also tell you that Germany seems like a great league. We have the best stadiums, the best infrastructures. The atmosphere is also ‘hotter’ than in England.<br /><br />I listen to what is being said about me, but it’s not something I bother myself with. My father deals with off the pitch stuff. Apparently a few clubs are interested, but we’ll analyse all that at the end of the season</p>

It’s a great honour to wear the jersey of Belgium, the feeling is just different, it makes me very proud and I’m finally allowed to play in perhaps the best Belgian national team of all time<br /><br />We are certainly favourites, but I would not consider ourselves a top favourite <b>[for the trophy]</b> as other countries have more experience</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard says it would be difficult for him to play alongside brother Eden Hazard at club level]</b> We already play together for Belgium, even if we are sometimes not on the pitch together sadly. It’s a good feeling to play for your country alongside your brother. But, honestly? It would be difficult to play for one club with my brother. He is a bigger player than I am. I can learn a lot from him and must work hard to improve. I am a different type of player. Eden’s one of the best players worldwide. When I joined Chelsea, it was clear that I’d be sent on loan like so many other talents. And that’s why I went to Belgium for two years and I showed good performances there. When I played for the Blues, I was too young and not ready for the big step. Chelsea are a big club with outstanding players. It was a better decision for me to play for another team.<br /><br />Sometimes I watch his games and sometimes he watches mine. Then it’s like: ‘Cool, keep it up!’ We don’t talk football that much. You might think that’s the case from the outside, but it’s not like that. We talk family and the kids. We are in touch nearly every day, but football is not that big of an issue. Eden does not give me any advice. He’s just happy for me and, of course, is incredibly proud of me. I am just not as talented and must work hard to learn the things he might learn much faster. I am being totally honest here. Moreover, Eden has worked a lot on himself in the past year. He’s in top form and wants to win the title with Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard made the right decision to stay at Chelsea]</b> Eden made the right decision to stay at Chelsea. Chelsea weren’t keen on selling him and he had a strong start of the season. Real Madrid are in a complex period. They sacked their manager, key players left. They have to rebuild.<br /><br />I think Eden will see what happens at the end of the season. I know him. He’s not thinking about a move right now. He will give everything for Chelsea. He doesn’t want a clash with his club either. If he ever leaves, he will play it correctly.</p>

I am focusing on excelling at Borussia Monchengladbach, but I still hope to play for Chelsea one day.<br /><br /><b>[Hazard again remained optimistic that his contract did include a clause]</b> My father <b>[Thierry Hazard]</b> deals with <b>[contract issues]</b> now. Sometimes, I hear there is one. Here, I’m told there isn’t. Frankly, I don’t know. It’s not that I don’t care, but I don’t think about it. I’m happy here. If Chelsea want to buy me back one day, I think they’ll do it, that’s not an issue. Actually, if there is or isn’t one, it’s the same, really</p>

I have to work things out that he might learn faster if I am being completely honest. Eden also worked a lot on himself last year.
