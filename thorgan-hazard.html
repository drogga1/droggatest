  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard could be heading back to join brother Eden in England]</b> England is appealing, but when you speak to players who play there, they also tell you that Germany seems like a great league. We have the best stadiums, the best infrastructures. The atmosphere is also ‘hotter’ than in England.<br /><br />I listen to what is being said about me, but it’s not something I bother myself with. My father deals with off the pitch stuff. Apparently a few clubs are interested, but we’ll analyse all that at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard insists Belgium have the talent to win the World Cup]</b> It’s going to be difficult, but it’s possible we’ll become world champions, we have the players and the coaching staff for it, some of us play in the best clubs in the world and are in the top of the league.<br /><br /><b>[Thorgan is also looking forward to playing alongside his sibling Eden Hazard]</b> I’m always happy to be able to play with him, we do not meet so often. It’s a great honour to wear the jersey of Belgium, the feeling is just different, it makes me very proud and I’m finally allowed to play in perhaps the best Belgian national team of all time<br /><br />We are certainly favourites, but I would not consider ourselves a top favourite <b>[for the trophy]</b> as other countries have more experience</p>

  <p><b>[Thorgan Hazard says it would be difficult for him to play alongside brother Eden Hazard at club level]</b> We already play together for Belgium, even if we are sometimes not on the pitch together sadly. It’s a good feeling to play for your country alongside your brother. But, honestly? It would be difficult to play for one club with my brother. He is a bigger player than I am. I can learn a lot from him and must work hard to improve. I am a different type of player. Eden’s one of the best players worldwide. When I joined Chelsea, it was clear that I’d be sent on loan like so many other talents. And that’s why I went to Belgium for two years and I showed good performances there. When I played for the Blues, I was too young and not ready for the big step. Chelsea are a big club with outstanding players. It was a better decision for me to play for another team.<br /><br />Sometimes I watch his games and sometimes he watches mine. Then it’s like: ‘Cool, keep it up!’ We don’t talk football that much. You might think that’s the case from the outside, but it’s not like that. We talk family and the kids. We are in touch nearly every day, but football is not that big of an issue. Eden does not give me any advice. He’s just happy for me and, of course, is incredibly proud of me. I am just not as talented and must work hard to learn the things he might learn much faster. I am being totally honest here. Moreover, Eden has worked a lot on himself in the past year. He’s in top form and wants to win the title with Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard made the right decision to stay at Chelsea]</b> Eden made the right decision to stay at Chelsea. Chelsea weren’t keen on selling him and he had a strong start of the season. Real Madrid are in a complex period. They sacked their manager, key players left. They have to rebuild.<br /><br />I think Eden will see what happens at the end of the season. I know him. He’s not thinking about a move right now. He will give everything for Chelsea. He doesn’t want a clash with his club either. If he ever leaves, he will play it correctly.</p>

  <p><b>[Do Chelsea have a buy-back clause for Thorgan Hazard?]</b> It is true that Chelsea has a buy-back option. I’m glad, because I hope to still play for Chelsea. That remains a goal. I am focusing on excelling at Borussia Monchengladbach, but I still hope to play for Chelsea one day.<br /><br /><b>[Hazard again remained optimistic that his contract did include a clause]</b> My father <b>[Thierry Hazard]</b> deals with <b>[contract issues]</b> now. Sometimes, I hear there is one. Here, I’m told there isn’t. Frankly, I don’t know. It’s not that I don’t care, but I don’t think about it. I’m happy here. If Chelsea want to buy me back one day, I think they’ll do it, that’s not an issue. Actually, if there is or isn’t one, it’s the same, really</p>

  <p><b>[On wager with Eden Hazard]</b> There has been a kind of competition between us for years. If you score the fewest goals, you have to invite the other to dinner at the end of the season.<br /><br /><b>[Thorgan doesn’t see things the same way as Eden]</b> I just have less talent than him. I have to work things out that he might learn faster if I am being completely honest. Eden also worked a lot on himself last year. Right now, my brother is in great shape and wants to win the title with Chelsea. I’m a different type of player than my brother. Eden is one of the best players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach’s Thorgan Hazard has confirmed that he has reached a personal agreement with Borussia Dortmund]</b> I have a contract for one more season, but I have already said before that I want to take the next step in my career. I want to experience something new. It’s now up to the clubs to reach an agreement. That will take a bit of time, it’s always like that with negotiations. There are talks between Gladbach and Dortmund, yes. I have a personal agreement with Dortmund. It’s out of my hands. It’s up to the clubs now.<br /><br /><b>[Thorgan admits that he knows what his brother Eden Hazard wants]</b> I used to be a Real Madrid fan because Zidane played for them and we were big fans of him. It was in the Galacticos days. They had a superb team at the time. Eden knows what I want and I know what he wants</p>
