  <p><b>[Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy has promised to do his utmost to make a positive impression with England]</b> I want to give him a decision to make. Obviously I’ve been called up for a reason and there’s now four of us here, but it’s a time for me to go out there and prove what I can do. We’re away for seven or eight days, so it’s enough time to sort of show him what I can do. I’ve been in two squads before but that was quite a while ago, so obviously after the World Cup and everything that has gone on it’s been a positive for English football. It’s nice to be back involved and a part of it.<br /><br />We have had a positive start to the season and to get the call-up was the cherry on the top. When you are growing up as a kid, all you want to do is play football and represent your country. If I do get my chance, I know I will take it. I will be overwhelmed</p>
