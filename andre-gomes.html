  <p><b>[Andre Gomes admits he is enduring sporting hell at Barcelona after struggling to justify a €35 million transfer fee]</b> I don’t feel well on the field, I am not enjoying the thing I like to do. The first six months were pretty good but then things changed. Maybe it’s not the correct word but it turned into a bit of a hell, because I started to feel more pressure. With pressure I feel fine, but with pressure on myself, I don’t. The feeling that I have during games is bad.<br /><br />In the sessions, I am calm. I feel comfortable with my teammates. Obviously there are days that I feel a little low on confidence, and in training it is noticeable. Maybe I played the day before and I still have the image of the game in my head, and that doesn’t let me move forward<br /><br />On more than one occasion, I didn’t want to leave my house. Because people look at you, having the fear of going on the street out of shame. My friends tell me I am going with the handbrake on. I close myself off. I don’t take the frustration I have out. Then I don’t talk to anybody, I don’t bother anyone. It is like I feel ashamed. Thinking too much has hurt me. I think about the bad things and what I have to do. Although my team-mates help me a lot, the things don’t work out the way they want them to work out</p>

I am enjoying myself and living the dream that all children want to live.<br /><br />The first six months were pretty good but then things changed. Maybe it’s not the correct word but it turned into a bit of a hell, because I started to feel more pressure. With pressure I feel fine, but with pressure on myself, I don’t.

  <p><b>[Everton midfielder Andre Gomes says his decision to join the Toffees was the best one]</b> I am sure I made the best decision <b>[to join Everton]</b>. I spoke with Phil Neville, too. I am good friends with him from my time at Valencia, and he played here and he knew how the club works. I spoke to Lucas Digne, too. He played with me in Barcelona, he signed two or three weeks before me and he gave me information about the Club and the facilities. I am glad to be at Everton now and really happy with the decision. I am getting confidence and better every day so I am really happy with that. Of course, I had other offers. Marco was very important for me - the way he spoke to me and the confidence he gave me. I spoke with him a few times before I made the decision.<br /><br />It was easy for me <b>[to settle in]</b>. The boys here are amazing. The spirit and the way you feel like part of a family is really important - and all the boys here and the staff and Everton are amazing. And the fans, too, the way they receive you is great</p>

  <p><b>[Everton midfielder Andre Gomes has admitted he is enjoying his football again at Goodison Park]</b> I wasn’t unhappy in Barcelona, but I was feeling the struggle. Sometimes, I’m more negative than positive about myself. I’d be the first person to shout at myself, close the door and scream that I didn’t play good. Sometimes, you try not to care about the things you read on social media, and even if you do, someone might tell you. It’s difficult because <b>[Barcelona]</b> is a massive club, and you have to be prepared. Somehow, perhaps I wasn’t prepared for that side. I was just preparing to play football, go to the stadium and play, so maybe I wasn’t prepared for that situation.<br /><br />I came from an injury and actually, I didn’t realise that on my first game here I hadn’t played for six months. The last game that I played was in April, and the next one I played after summer was against Tottenham and I got injured for 10 weeks. But the boys here, they were amazing with me. I remember on day one with Jags <b>[Phil Jagielka]</b>, I didn’t have clothes to go to training, so he gave me the kit! He explained to me where to go for the training kit man and everything. I’m feeling really happy here</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Gomes is really happy at Everton]</b> I have to say that I am really happy here. At the moment I am happy with everyone, <b>[but]</b> obviously I’m not so happy because as a club we want more. I am enjoying playing for Everton and enjoying my life here but I have to wait til the end of the season. I am one of the people who can decide the future but I am still a Barcelona player and I have to respect everybody. I will decide at the end of the season, but right now I am happy here.<br /><br />The Premier League is hard. Sometimes you feel you are in control and in fact, you’re not. Often small details change games and that has happened a few times this year, when you come from a defeat like that <b>[Newcastle]</b> it’s difficult to build confidence again. But Chelsea will be a good challenge to build that confidence back up again<br /><br />Since I was a kid, I was watching games from the Premier League. I wanted to play here and have that experience, I am really happy here and the fans have been with me since day one</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Andre Gomes is yet to decide what his future holds]</b> To be honest, I try not to think about that. One thing football has given to me is teach me how to manage situations and how to enjoy it day by day. Every day is a new challenge and every weekend in the Premier League is a new challenge and so I try to think only in the present. If I think further ahead than that then I will probably lose my mind in some way so I am trying to finish the season in the best way possible, give my best in every training session and in every game. We will see in the end. Sometimes we don’t stop and don’t figure out that the most important thing is to be happy and enjoy… sometimes we cross that path slightly. When we win a title or win a few important games we don’t enjoy the moments. Especially after my time in Barcelona, there were good things and really bad things, so this year was really good for me to understand that we have to enjoy it more because we love football, it is our job, but we have to enjoy it more</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> midfielder Andre Gomes reveals key reason behind his miraculous injury recovery]</b> <b>[Doctor Hollingsworth’s actions]</b> were really, really important. I knew that he wanted to put my foot in the right place. Obviously I had adrenaline, I was upset, but I knew what was supposed to <b>[happen]</b> with these types of injuries, or at least <b>[to act]</b> as fast as you can. The doctor, he put my foot in the right place so it was really easy to mobilise my ankle and go to the hospital. It was really massive work, great. And maybe that helped a lot on my recovery and maybe to be able to have surgery straight away the next day. If he hadn’t done that, once I got to hospital, I don’t want to say it would have been too late, but the more time in that wrong position, probably it would have been worse and more painful for me. Basically, the doc did a brilliant job. I was feeling everything in that moment <b>[on the pitch]</b> - I was aware of it and, for me, it was much better to have the help of the doctor in that moment than maybe 10, 20 or 30 minutes after<br /><br />If I feel good and the manager wants me to start then I will say ‘yes’ but we go day-by-day and decide at the end of the week. Carlo has a lot of experience as a football player and a manager, everybody respects him and he’s a really smart guy, and he’s helping us. We’ve had really good results in the last two months and he has been really important for us. We are improving day by day. If I play, I think it will be unbelievable. It will be good to be back at home. I was there already to watch the games from the stand but it’s not the same. I’m looking forward to being back with my family - with all <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonians</a> - and I want the three points<br /><br /><b>[I want]</b> to say thank you to everyone who was there to help me. Everybody was great on my recovery. Honestly, I was the person with the issue but everybody was involved in my recovery - not only family but friends, staff, physios, my teammates as well, <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonians</a>, fans in general all around the world - everyone was really good. I felt the confidence to work hard to come back as soon as possible, so for that I’m really thankful for everyone.</p>
