  <p><b>[Everton have signed Andre Gomes from Barcelona for a fee of €25 million]</b> I’m really happy to sign the contract with Everton - it wasn’t hard to decide, it was an easy decision and I’m very happy to have made it. I know the club made a massive effort to sign me and I’m very happy and thankful to them. I said during the year that I felt part of a family and that is the most important thing to me. Last year was a really good experience for me. I just wanted to feel part of something special and I found it here. It was good for me in that moment and right now, after signing for Everton, it’s even better.</p>

I will leave that for <a href="marcel-brands.html">Marcel Brands</a> <b>[director of football]</b>. Kurt played really well last season. He’s a fantastic guy and a fantastic player. Obviously if Everton wants him I will say to buy him because he’s really good.

I came injured so it wasn’t easy, but from the first game they were with me and helped me a lot. I know the club much better and it is an honour to be here. If Everton wanted me, it was my first option<br /><br /><b>[While he is now fully focused on events in England, Gomes admits to having taken important lessons from the two seasons he spent with a star-studded squad at Camp Nou]</b> Barcelona was a really good experience, I improved a lot and played with some of the best players in the world: <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>, <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>.

  <p><b>[Everton’s Andre Gomes grateful for ‘support of the people’ following swift return from injury]</b> I need to thank everyone, the team they were great, my supporters, Evertonians and also football supporters in general, everyone has been wonderful with me. Other players, professionals and ex-professionals; everyone has been wonderful so I need to thank you. It gives me confidence and it feels like you have the support of the people. I just pushed myself to my limit and wanted to be back as soon as possible. I am glad I have the help of everyone around me<br /><br />Obviously it is a sad <b>[result]</b>. I think we played a good game, obviously we conceded a few chances for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but we need to look forward to the next games. We have three tough games coming. We had a lot of chances in the last 20 minutes with more people up front. It’s hard to take. It’s very important for the team that we have scored the goals, we just need to concede less</p>

  <p><b>[Everton midfielder Andre Gomes reveals key reason behind his miraculous injury recovery]</b> <b>[Doctor Hollingsworth’s actions]</b> were really, really important. I knew that he wanted to put my foot in the right place. Obviously I had adrenaline, I was upset, but I knew what was supposed to <b>[happen]</b> with these types of injuries, or at least <b>[to act]</b> as fast as you can. The doctor, he put my foot in the right place so it was really easy to mobilise my ankle and go to the hospital. It was really massive work, great. And maybe that helped a lot on my recovery and maybe to be able to have surgery straight away the next day. If he hadn’t done that, once I got to hospital, I don’t want to say it would have been too late, but the more time in that wrong position, probably it would have been worse and more painful for me. Basically, the doc did a brilliant job. I was feeling everything in that moment <b>[on the pitch]</b> - I was aware of it and, for me, it was much better to have the help of the doctor in that moment than maybe 10, 20 or 30 minutes after<br /><br />If I feel good and the manager wants me to start then I will say ‘yes’ but we go day-by-day and decide at the end of the week. Carlo has a lot of experience as a football player and a manager, everybody respects him and he’s a really smart guy, and he’s helping us. We’ve had really good results in the last two months and he has been really important for us. We are improving day by day. If I play, I think it will be unbelievable. It will be good to be back at home. I was there already to watch the games from the stand but it’s not the same. I’m looking forward to being back with my family - with all Evertonians - and I want the three points<br /><br /><b>[I want]</b> to say thank you to everyone who was there to help me. Everybody was great on my recovery. Honestly, I was the person with the issue but everybody was involved in my recovery - not only family but friends, staff, physios, my teammates as well, Evertonians, fans in general all around the world - everyone was really good. I felt the confidence to work hard to come back as soon as possible, so for that I’m really thankful for everyone.</p>
