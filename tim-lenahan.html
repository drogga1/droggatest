<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Santiago Solari’s journey to Real Madrid began with an American detour]</b> Even to make that decision at that age, to come so you can improve your English and grow and be independent for the first time, even to make that decision puts him light years above other kids. Being able to come here at 17 and to grow in a nurturing environment before going through the pro system, I think helped him so when he made the moves later on from Rosario to Buenos Aires, then to Madrid, he was able to handle those transitions better.<br /><br /><b>[Lenahan knew he had a special talent on his hands back in 1994, but didn’t know just how good Solari would be]</b> I thought he would go down and be a great pro in Argentina. Did I think he and I would be lifting the Champions League trophy after he just played 90 minutes and assisted on the greatest goal in Champions League history eight years later? No, I didn’t know that<br /><br />The game was on a Friday night and he took the ball bag out the next day and I don’t know how many shots he shot from that same spot. Eight years later I’m watching the Champions League, he subs in against Porto and gets that same shot and tucks it right in the corner. The old adage is good players do it till they get it right, the great ones do it till they can’t get it wrong. Santiago had that drive<br /><br /><b>[On Zinedine Zidane]</b> It’s a little different than Zidane because ZIdane had a pre-made team that wasn’t achieving. This team may be underachieving a bit, but I don’t think it’s the class of the league either. I think he’ll treat the players with respect, and I think they’ll play for him. If it’s only a matter of a couple of weeks or months, then it’s still an unbelievable experience for his career, and if not at Real Madrid he’ll be a first-division coach somewhere in the world<br /><br />I’m not ruling out somewhere west of Spain. <b>[David]</b> Beckham was a teammate of his so who knows<br /><br />My running joke is because of my coaching he made the first team at River Plate at 19. Because without my coaching he would have made it at 18</p>
