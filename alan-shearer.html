  <p><b>[Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has revealed that he warned Steve Bruce not to take a ‘toxic’ job at St James’s Park, only to see his advice fall on deaf ears]</b> I was out for dinner with Steve Bruce three weeks ago. It was just after Rafa Benitez had left Newcastle and we spoke about what he should do if he was approached and offered the job. My advice to him that night was simple: ‘No, no, no, don’t take it’. I said: ‘Why are you going to be any different to <b>[Kevin]</b> Keegan or Benitez? If you take it, you must be mad because you know how it works there’. But Steve is his own man and I respect that. I can’t tell him what to do, even though he is a good friend of mine. He was not Newcastle’s first choice to replace Rafa. He might not even have been their second, third or fourth pick. It looks more like he could have been the last man standing - and Newcastle just knew he would probably take the job because he has always wanted it<br /><br />He knows what is going on and what has gone on in the past. He knows how fed up the fan-base is. He knows how the football club is run, it is not a secret anymore. This is without a doubt the toughest and most toxic situation Steve has ever walked into. No job is impossible but this one is very, very difficult for so many different reasons. On the playing side, he is inheriting a squad that is wafer-thin. Newcastle’s two top scorers from last season - Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon - are no longer there and they are the only Premier League club not to have made a signing this summer. Steve is at a disadvantage already because all the other clubs have had weeks to plan and will have stolen a march on him. He’ll do a good job just to keep Newcastle up this season</p>

He is five behind my international tally of 30 and it is only a matter of time before he overtakes me. Harry will be eyeing up Wayne Rooney’s England record of 53 goals and given he is still only 26 years old, he has every chance of breaking it. If he stays fit, Harry could have another six or seven years playing for England. There are more international matches now, and a lot against weaker opposition, which is great for him and any forward. Harry is going to get plenty of chances, especially because he is playing alongside Raheem Sterling<br /><br /><b>[Shearer added on a stunning spot-kick record]</b> I just love Harry Kane’s confidence and self-belief when it comes to taking penalties. Of his 25 goals for England, eight have come from the spot. But even if 24 of his 25 goals were penalties, it does not matter one jot as a centre-forward. He is a single-minded and cold-blooded No. 9 who has an insatiable desire and hunger to score - and that makes him such a ruthless penalty-taker</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is not a natural goalscorer]</b> Gareth Southgate’s assessment that <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is not a No. 9 is spot on. Even this season, when Manchester United’s main striker <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> left, boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> plays <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> down the middle. I get the feeling Marcus feels more confident coming in off the left where he does not have to play a lot with his back to goal. There is no denying he is an excellent talent but I don’t think he is a natural goalscorer. We sometimes forget he is only 21 so time is still on his side. But he is very different to <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, who is determined and ruthless.<br /><br />I do not think Marcus will be bothered by the England boss’ words. We have not heard from Marcus where he prefers to play and I have never spoken to him about it. But Gareth probably would not have said that if Marcus had told him he sees himself as a centre-forward. For England, it is not a problem because he will never play there ahead of Harry, and Marcus looked sharp against Bulgaria from the left. It is a bigger issue for United because they have taken a huge gamble by not replacing <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>. Going into the season with just Marcus, <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> is very risky and that is a huge burden for those three to carry over a long campaign</p>

Does he see himself as the main centre forward? <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> has gone and the manager still didn’t play him down the middle. When he had the option to play him or <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> he played Martial, when he was injured it was slightly different<br /><br />That doesn’t mean to say he can’t score goals.

But at the minute, particularly with England, he’s not going to play centre-forward. There’s only one guy and that is <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>.

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford endured another frustrating afternoon for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on Sunday]</b> The problem that <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> have got is that 19 games, scored 17 in all competitions, four of them were against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and this is the reason why - because no urgency, no spark, no creativity. Mata should go forward <b>[when he had the ball inside <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> half]</b>, he should go forward, but instead he chooses to go backwards. It’s a nightmare for forwards, they were slow, had too many touches. If Rashford wants to play centre-forward and he wants to score more goals, which I’m sure he does, he has to do better than this. His movement has to be better, he has to move for the ball and attack the ball instead of waiting for the ball.

But I just wonder, I analysed him a couple of weeks ago at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and exactly the same things are happening as they were then - there is no movement. I wonder if anyone is actually saying anything to him because nothing has changed. He’s not moving into the box and he’s making it far easier for the defenders than it should be but he is young, he is still learning and it has to be a very frustrating time for him because that team at the moment is awful</p>

But I think he’s still searching for what he feels is the right system and personnel to fill it<br /><br /><b>[A man with 30 goals for the Three Lions to his name]</b> No one has labelled the new England team ‘great’ but we are certainly better than we showed on Friday.

Everyone is allowed a below-par performance from time to time but it’s how you react.<br /><br />Of course Friday’s performance is going to be criticised and scrutinised but you’re playing for England, you should expect that.

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer claims <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defence is so bad it’s unbelievable]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s biggest problem is recruitment, defensively they are so bad it’s unbelievable. Going forward they are fine because they have <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>. But in terms of the quality of their defenders and midfielders they are miles behind the top teams. They spent £72 million on a winger in Lille’s <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a>, when they knew they had big problems at the back. That made no sense at all. True, they were left high and dry when <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a> suddenly wanted to leave so late in the transfer window but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defensive problems had been apparent long before that<br /><br />The ease with which <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> beat <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shows that the Gunners are miles away from where they used to be - and where they want to be. It’s going to take a lot of time and a lot of investment to get them competing at the highest level. I would say at least two or three years and definitely a huge amount of money</p>

Absolutely no doubt about it<br /><br />I think he was magnificent again today. The way he drove <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward, the way he kept everything moving, his attitude, his work-rate both attacking and defensively, starting moves off, can he pass it forward? Yes he can.<br /><br />He gets his reward of his goal because of his hard work. I thought he was magnificent, as he has been all season. What a season he’s having, absolutely incredible. When you look at some of their performances, how special <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have been, whether it’s the goalkeeper, <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk, or the front three, he for me has been the driving force. He’s been superb</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer says England need <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> &amp; <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> to be fit]</b> I would hope England have a really good opportunity because they could even play the semi-final and final both at Wembley. At the minute, we don’t have <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> or <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> fit in terms of centre forwards, so if we are going to be successful, we will need those two fit, especially Kane. But, if not England, then France<br /><br />You have got great opportunities whether the manager picks <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> or not and asks him to come out of retirement. He is the joint top scorer in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the minute with 17 goals along with Aubameyang; then you have <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> who has had a very good season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer believes it wouldn’t be fair to declare the Reds champions if the season isn’t finished]</b> If, and it is a huge if, the season cannot be completed then there is no way you can have a winner or loser. As harsh and as horrible as that would be for some clubs, none more so than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it is the only outcome. If you cannot complete the fixtures then you cannot go handing out titles or consider relegating anybody. For <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it would be incredibly harsh. But I cannot see how it would be fair to hand them the title - despite the fact it is obvious nobody is going to catch them. They only need six points to wrap it up but they haven’t got them yet so for that reason it has to be declared null and void. It would be very different if the season was suspended after they had got the points to win it. But they haven’t and however horrible a scenario it would be, it’s the only option</p>

  <p><b>[Shearer admits to disliking <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> as he recalls bust-up during <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s 2001 win over Man Utd]</b> Yeah, I didn’t like him. I had loads of rucks with him and I wasn’t the only one. It was a throw-in in the far corner where I stopped him taking an early throw. We were beating them at St. James’ and he wanted to take a quick throw-in and he’d been at me all game as he normally was. It was about three or four minutes before the end of the game. I can’t remember exactly what I said, I called him some sort of name. He got the red card and I remember having a little smile and thought: ‘I’ve done you <b>[like]</b> a kipper here. I can’t believe you’ve fallen into that little trap<br /><br />And I can see him <b>[in the tunnel]</b>. The steam was coming out of his ears, and then the final whistle goes and I’m thinking: ‘Do I run straight off? Do I try and get up there?’ Because I knew for a fact that Roy would be waiting at the top of the tunnel. So I don’t know, I say thanks and shake hands and what have you and there’s this big commotion going on and I look up and there’s Roy, he’s waiting for me at the top of the tunnel</p>

I saw <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> in the morning and talks had gone really, really well. Then the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> contingent came in. His first question to me was: ‘Am I seeing you first or am I seeing you second?’ I told him I had seen Kevin in the morning and I won’t tell you his words. He said basically I’ve got no chance, then. He wanted to see me first. But I thought the talks went extremely well. I was very impressed with what he had to say. I had to go and make a decision. At one point, I was going to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. But then, I sat down and I got a call from Kevin who asked to see me a day or two later.

I left him a message after the third time and no surprise, I never got a call back! I’ve got no regrets, I’d do the same again<br /><br />I asked if I could take the penalties.
