  <p><b>[Shearer believes the 31-year-old will have options to consider at the end of the season]</b> He’s only 31 years old but he started very early. He was 16 when he debuted for Everton. I’m sure he will have options and I think he said he did not want to go to another Premier League club. He has another 16 months left at Man United, plus the option of another year, so he could stay at Old Trafford and it might not be easy to force him out if at all they want to do that. It also depends on whether he wants to stay or leave. Without doubt he will have offers, but I’d be surprised if he was at Manchester United next season.<br /><br />He is having a magnificent season. What surprises me is the number of games he’s playing. I expected him to come to Manchester United and make an impact. I didn’t expect him to come and have an influence in every game he’s playing. He is their talisman and what I admire about him is that I retired just before I turned 36 and I know what it takes to get up every day and have that desire to play against defenders 26 and 27 years old at their peak trying to kick you. That is what I admire about him. I think it is a great opportunity for the youngsters in the United team like <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard to see a guy with such experience still have the desire and hunger to train every day<br /><br />Though Manchester United have won the first trophy of the season and are on very good run of form, I don’t think they will finish in the top four. They are dependent on Ibrahimovic. They did get the rub of the green against Southampton in the EFL Cup final with the disallowed goal. My personal opinion is that Man United won’t finish in the top four</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa could yet depart Chelsea and the Premier League for China]</b> I’m a big fan of his. The way he links his team together and brings them together is good. If he had moved, it would’ve been a big loss to the Premier League but it would have been a bigger loss for Chelsea. I’m pleased he’s stayed in the Premier League, but it wouldn’t be a surprise to me if China came calling for him again.<br /><br />I like him a lot. He pushes the boundaries and he’s hard. As a centre-forward, you have to make life very difficult for the centre-backs. When he comes off after 90 minutes, he must know he was in for a game and I think Costa is one of the best in doing that. That’s what I did and you must not let the defenders bully you. I think he has the balance right this season. Last season, he was too extreme and getting sent off. This season, it’s been very good. A centre-forward is judged on the goals he scores and he’s once again being the player he was two years ago</p>

  <p><b>[England are not the most talented team at this World Cup]</b> England are probably not the most talented team at this World Cup but we showed against Colombia why we have now got a great chance of winning it. What we might lack in ability, we make up for with a superb team spirit and enormous character, and it is amazing how far that can take you. As we saw on what was a memorable night for Gareth Southgate’s side in Moscow on Tuesday, the difference between success and failure in football can come down to extremely fine margins. The best teams do not always come out on top, but it is the ones with togetherness and belief that go on and achieve things at a tournament like this, and England have definitely shown their mettle there. They overcame every setback they faced against the South Americans and everyone is so proud of them, especially because all the previous shootout failures we have had made things even harder. There have probably been more gifted England squads at World Cups in recent years but, in terms of a unit, we might not have had a better group of players than this one. That’s part of what makes this team different - England are young, vibrant and exciting and have got a great attitude.<br /><br />What next? Well, anything is possible, but I am still reluctant to think beyond our quarter-final with Sweden, because this World Cup has been so ridiculously unpredictable until now. But, whatever happens in Samara on Saturday, this tournament has already been a successful one from England’s point of view. We have won a knockout game for the first time since 2006, and also won our first ever World Cup penalty shootout. Those are already real achievements for Gareth’s young side to take away from Russia, but now the fans want more, and I know the England players will be the same</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford will never be a striker at Manchester United]</b> I am a big fan of ­Marcus Rashford. He gets into good positions, runs in behind defenders and is a ­constant threat. His goal at Wembley on ­Saturday night showcased what he is all about. Unfortunately his two missed chances that could have earned England a point in their Nations League match with Spain also told you where he is at right now.

Yes he is still very young at 20, but when will his situation change? As long as Romelu Lukaku stays fit he is not going to get a starting spot as the lone striker at Old Trafford. As long as Jose Mourinho is the ­manager, there is not going to be two up top. Even if Lukaku did not play, my money would be on Alexis Sanchez being moved into the middle and further forward. And would Mourinho really turn to Rashford if he needed another striker? Or would he go to the transfer market for a tried and trusted ready-made goalscorer? Rashford has been played so long in a wide position in a three, that it does take time to readjust to his natural position. Time is not a great commodity in football nowadays. I am not advocating Rashford moves away from Old Trafford. It is a great club to be at. But if he wants to achieve an ambition to be recognised as a great goalscorer it is just not going to happen there. He would need to move with the assurance that his next club will make him the main man, the striker, the one up top or one of two. Then I truly believe he would develop into a goalscorer</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer says Harry Kane cannot be tired]</b> I keep being told that Harry Kane is tired. Nobody mentioned this, of course, after Tottenham had beaten Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford last month. However, after failing to score in successive league defeats for Spurs and in two games for England, Kane apparently needs a rest. When I was still playing, the suggestion anybody might be tired never came into the equation. And particularly not when you were just 25 years old. It makes me wonder whether if people keep saying it, you start to believe it yourself. Kane, however, has not looked fresh for some time - and once again on Saturday during a woeful Spurs performance in defeat to Liverpool he looked very leggy. Some Spurs fans may even tell you this has been the case for a while now. Certainly, it does still make you wonder if he rushed himself back from that ankle injury in March as he contended for the Prem Golden Boot with Mo Salah. He hasn’t been able to hit the same form since.<br /><br />The Golden Boot he won at the World Cup has possibly even masked a deeper problem with his form. You can’t take any credit away from him for winning the award in Russia - but of his six goals, three were penalties and one a lucky deflection. His hat-trick came against undoubtedly the weakest side in the tournament, Panama. When we came up against our toughest opponent, Croatia in the semi-finals, Kane’s moment just came and went. You can mask poor form when you are scoring goals but in his last four appearances for club and country <b>[albeit as a sub against Switzerland]</b> he has not found the net</p>

  <p><b>[Former England captain Alan Shearer has delivered a damning verdict of Paul Pogba’s recent displays]</b> He was pathetic again at West Ham and was that bad that Mourinho had to drag him off as he was offering nothing. Paul Pogba is Manchester United’s record signing. Just take that in for a moment and consider all the great players who have played for this club. Despite being a World Cup winner, he cannot lace the boots of those whose names will go down in history at Old Trafford. If he is looking to get the manager out then he is doing a much better job of that than playing football, as his team-mates were not much better. And where was Alexis Sanchez? This is a player they fought tooth and nail to sign ahead of their big rivals, pipping Pep to his signature. Yet he sums up everything wrong with United. He was not even on the bench after a series of poor displays. He has got nowhere near the levels we saw at Arsenal since the move and you have to ask why<br /><br />A manager of Mourinho’s stature and an incredible CV does not deserve this. Yet is he blameless? What on earth was he doing tactically in the 3-1 defeat at West Ham? Playing a young midfielder in Scott McTominay in a back three with Eric Bailly on the bench. If you are trying to make a point about a failure to buy a centre-half in the summer then you do it in better ways than by sacrificing three points</p>

  <p><b>[England’s decision to hand Wayne Rooney a recall for a friendly date with the United States has been questioned]</b> It is great for Wayne Rooney to have the chance to say goodbye to fans at Wembley. And using next week’s friendly between England and the USA to raise money for charity is a brilliant idea. But I keep hearing managers and players complaining that there is too much football. And now we are to have a testimonial in mid-November. Wayne is England’s record goalscorer and had a superb international career. But it is an honour to play for England - England should not have to honour you. Given Wayne retired from international football 15 months ago, if the FA really wanted to give him a send-off, why could they not invite him to the game as a guest? That would make more sense than saying: ‘Thanks for playing for England, Wayne, here’s another game for you’. We have never done that with other players. And the cynic would wonder if the FA are only doing this because they are struggling to sell tickets for the Wembley friendly on Thursday week. You would think Gareth Southgate would need this match to prepare for the future, but clearly not.<br /><br />Were Wayne to be England’s best player against the USA, I would not get excited. Nothing changes. There is no way he is coming back to play for England going forward. And even if he wanted to, Gareth has shown his intention in the way he has picked youngsters in his squads. I agreed with Wayne’s decision to retire from England in August 2017. He had not been at his best for the last year of his international career and it was the right time to call it a day. It was also the right time for him to leave the Premier League and go to America. It is really good to see Wayne enjoying his football again. And it is great that the FA want to pay tribute to his career and raise funds for his charity. But they should not turn an international match into a testimonial</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate has got everyone in love with England again]</b> Every manager for 20 years before him has underachieved given the calibre of player at his disposal …  not Gareth. There’s a good vibe about England, they are now entertaining to watch as well. It’s a team that’s unrecognisable from 13 months ago. Paper aeroplanes were being thrown by fans at Wembley during a 1-0 win over Slovenia last October that sealed qualification for Russia. But that was when Gareth was still laying the foundations for this England set up. You don’t just flick a switch to make an international side of note. The preparation, doing a job in a diligent way comes first, then winning games breeds confidence. Then you also need a manager with the courage of his convictions and a real belief in the team.<br /><br />For Gareth Southgate and his side, it’s just getting better and better …  and the manager and coaching team deserve enormous credit. He’s carried on the good work from the World Cup in the summer and this <b>[a 2-1 win over Croatia]</b> was another brilliant performance and match. We beat Spain away when the pressure was off, now we’ve beaten Croatia at home when all the pressure was on. That sends a message to other countries, the big countries, when we play them again in the Nations League finals and beyond. They now know England are a force to be reckoned with. We belong at this level and are not fazed by this level of opposition any more. Before, when we came up against good teams, we struggled. Now we’ve beaten two of the best sides including the Spanish in their backyard, before breaking down a strong Croatia in front of the home fans. Gareth’s got the energy and belief going forward, that they can keep getting better and better. And why not? We’ve got game-changers now. We’ve got a top-class striker. We’ve got a goalkeeper and defence growing in stature with every game. It shows the great job Gareth is doing, everyone is in love with England again</p>

He will already know he’s got to go again to force his way into the team. Gareth and his assistant Steve Holland are in the very nice situation of not missing big players when they are injured. I can’t remember the last time we talked like that. Jesse Lingard and John Stones were also out from midfield and defence respectively. Both were stars in Russia. We’ve now got four or five potential starters who weren’t even involved at the World Cup - Ben Chilwell, Callum Hudson-Odoi, the mightily impressive Jadon Sancho and Declan Rice, who came off the bench against the Czechs.

  <p><b>[Alan Shearer believes it wouldn’t be fair to declare <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> champions if the season isn’t finished]</b> If, and it is a huge if, the season cannot be completed then there is no way you can have a winner or loser. As harsh and as horrible as that would be for some clubs, none more so than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it is the only outcome. If you cannot complete the fixtures then you cannot go handing out titles or consider relegating anybody. For <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it would be incredibly harsh. But I cannot see how it would be fair to hand them the title - despite the fact it is obvious nobody is going to catch them. They only need six points to wrap it up but they haven’t got them yet so for that reason it has to be declared null and void. It would be very different if the season was suspended after they had got the points to win it. But they haven’t and however horrible a scenario it would be, it’s the only option</p>

I had loads of rucks with him and I wasn’t the only one. It was a throw-in in the far corner where I stopped him taking an early throw. We were beating them at St. James’ and he wanted to take a quick throw-in and he’d been at me all game as he normally was. It was about three or four minutes before the end of the game. I can’t remember exactly what I said, I called him some sort of name. He got the red card and I remember having a little smile and thought: ‘I’ve done you <b>[like]</b> a kipper here.
