  <p><b>[Luqman after Nemeziz boot launch event organsed by Adidas]</b> For me the past is the past and whatever success I’ve achieved before this is in the history. As a player, I can never settle and have to continue to improve. I need to work harder to improve my performance so that I can continue to grow and be a better player</p>

  <p><b>[Luqman moonlighting as delivery rider to pass time during PKP]</b> I am grateful to have been able to join Selangor 2, at least I am somewhere this year. Although I haven’t been able to play for them, I still have an organised training plan which motivates me to be ready to feature for the team.<br /><br />We don’t know when the outbreak will end, and when the Malaysian league resumes I will be able to play here first as no one is certain about the situation abroad. And when the time comes for me to leave for Europe, at least I will depart prepared<br /><br /><b>[He now plays the waiting game, while admitting that he does leave the house once in awhile despite the nationwide government-mandated movement control order]</b> For the time being I train at home together with my mates. I have to do a lot because I haven’t been playing for awhile. But sometimes I’ve been moonlighting as a delivery rider when I have free time, because that’s about the only thing that I can do to pass the time now</p>

  <p><b>[Luqman was ecstatic to be grouped together with the likes of <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a>, <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> and <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Gabriel Martinelli</a> - calling the nomination a big confidence booster for him in his fledgling career]</b> I’m very grateful for this award. This is a surprise and I never thought I would be named among the best 50 teenage players in the world. This is certainly a big motivation for me to keep moving forward in my career<br /><br /><b>[Lim is no longer part of NFDP and has since moved back to Germany after failing to get Malaysia into the 2019 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup and subsequent reveal of his massive pay package. But while the public’s opinion of the former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> academy coach may have soured, it is not a feeling shared by Luqman]</b> My relationship with coach Lim Teong Kim is very good. He is someone very special to me. It doesn’t matter to me what others may think of him. For me, he’s the best. When I was nothing, he was the one that made me into something. He taught me everything one by one. Anyone who has ever worked with him will know what he’s capable of. <br /><br />There’s a lot that I learnt during my time at AMD. In terms of discipline, being independent and so much more. As we lived together and trained together, I learned to understand others better. It is a progressive thing where I picked up many skills on and off the pitch<br /><br /><b>[A fact that Luqman admits hamper the hopes of any young strikers in the country, but the Kelantan-born is hoping more will embrace the challenge and not lose psychological game]</b> Yes it is true that most of the teams in Malaysia use foreign players as their preferred strikers or forwards. And all I can do is to take up this challenge and not have the mindset that I can’t compete with these imports. To me there is no giving up and seeing myself as inferior to them.<br /><br />Humans are the same - we have feet, they have feet. Perhaps some have too low an impression of themselves. If we look at other countries, they mostly value their locals more than the foreigners but it is the opposite here. Here the imports are prioritised and the locals are left behind. As a player, we have to believe we can be better<br /><br /><b>[It wasn’t the best outing for Malaysia in the competition, knocked out in the group stage after finishing below Myanmar, Cambodia and Philippines in Group A. But Luqman himself was selected to started in three of the four matches Malaysia played then, reaping the full benefits of gaining experience under a very trying situation]</b> I was very thankful to coach Ong Kim Swee for giving me a chance to play at a higher level. I respect all the players and they are very good. We were focused but we made mistakes on the pitch and that is normal for any footballers. I learned a lot from the seniors such as Danial Amier, Syamer Kutty, Adam, Irfan and Syahmi. All of them showed good mentality and it was a real experience for me because it was by first time with the U23s<br /><br /><b>[With the on-going global pandemic due to the coronavirus, Luqman has to shelve that plan for the time being and has since signed for Selangor 2 in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in a bid to get training and competitive matches under his belt while waiting for the situation to improve]</b> If things improve and I manage to go to Belgium, I want to do my best there and show everyone that Malaysians are really good footballers. Even when I was under coach Lim, I was the one who always answered yes to the question - who wants to play in Europe. It has always been my ambition to play there. If I was not able to do that, then I’m looking to play in the big leagues in Asia, the highest level that I can possibly achieve<br /><br />If it doesn’t improve, it means I’m staying here with Selangor 2, who I am also grateful for taking me on. I will be focus to do well for them and finish my contract with them. If I perform, then maybe there’s a chance that I will be able to get into the Selangor team under coach B. Sathianathan</p>
