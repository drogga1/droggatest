  <p><b>[Mr Somkid Jatusripitak, who is seen as Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha’s right hand man for economic affairs, said about fierce wrangling over key cabinet posts among coalition partners]</b> He’ll make a decision on the matter. He’ll invite all concerned parties for policy talks, so he can make an informed decision on the formation of the next government that can help move the country forward</p>

  <p><b>[Somkid Jatusripitak want the public don’t mention the economy too frequently]</b> I don’t think the issue is something one should complain about. The most important thing is confidence. If we keep talking about it, as the late former prime minister MR Kukrit Pramoj put it, this will make good things look bad, which will have wide repercussions</p>

  <p><b>[Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said the government launched the 400-billion-baht coronavirus relief package in part to help local people and businesses in what the government is calling ‘grassroots economic restoration’]</b> Thailand will be on the front lines launching an economic recovery plan to help small and medium-sized enterprises <b>[SMEs]</b> and community enterprises<br /><br /><b>[he underlying principle is to promote purchasing power and financial health in the bottom rungs of society to strengthen the overall economy]</b> The tourism and export sectors are weak and have continued to slow down. Recovery will take time because both sectors need domestic support as well as demand from foreign markets. State agencies must help farmers and people in provinces access financing and market channels and business operators should cooperate with government projects</p>
