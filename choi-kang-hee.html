<blockquote>
  <p>[Dalian Yifang’s former manager Choi Kang-hee on Yannick Carrasco] The game against Shenhua, we told him to be careful, do not be cautioned by the ref. But he still deliberately delayed the restart of the game to apply for a yellow card, which led to the suspension of the next game. After the suspension, he wanted to return to Europe earlier. We didn’t want to let him go, but for the sake of the player, we agreed. He also promised us to come back to play the next three games. However, after the international break, he was late and even disappeared. He was also very negative in the training after his return. When a player has a contract with the team and he still wants to force the club to let him leave - in my opinion, this is very unprofessional</p>
