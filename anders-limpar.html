  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder Anders Limpar says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have ‘the greatest character you could ever have’ in the Sweden international and hopes he is a success in England]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is definitely the super Swede nowadays. I just pray to God that he will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. There are not many who have won in Spain, in Italy, in England and the rest. I met him twice and he is the sweetest guy you could ever meet. He is awesome in that sense. His image is his image but all I can say is that behind that image he has a good heart. For Sweden he has been the bees knees. He has been everything for us this last 10 years. He has been the greatest ambassador we could have. In every era you have players who are lifting their club up, which <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is doing now. You need that. United have the greatest character you could ever have. He thinks he is the world. But the thing is, if you think you are the world and you don’t deliver you are in the shit. But he thinks he is the world and he delivers. You can’t ask for more</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have been urged to snap up <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> winger Emil Forsberg, with Anders Limpar claiming <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> would be ‘so lucky’ to land his fellow Swede]</b> If we get Emil Forsberg, we will be so lucky. He’s the biggest prospect we have in Europe. He has been really good in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and has been outstanding for the national side. If we get him, we would get a hell of a player who could produce points with assists and goals. Please God, we should sign him straight away - if we can<br /><br /><b>[Limpar added on the 26-year-old who contributed five goals and four assists to the Leipzig cause in 2017-18 and has also sparked talk of interest from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Emil would fit right in at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He is so mobile, he can pass the ball and put assists up. He is one of the better players I have seen here in Sweden in many years, if you take <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> away. He is a really good prospect<br /><br />I hope we are still going to produce as many goals as we always do. We are an unbelievable attacking team. But what we are lacking is the defending. Everyone knows the defending has not been so good. The back four and the midfield has looked very vulnerable when we play against the top sides, so if he can tighten that up, we are going to look so sharp. So the whole team has to defend much better<br /><br /><a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> has been tremendous at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> before that - and at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. He is a top, top manager. If he can just turn things around at the Emirates then there will be no-one happier than me. We definitely have players who can win the league, we just want a manager who can put everything together</p>
