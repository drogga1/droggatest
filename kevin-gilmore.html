  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced that head coach Remi Garde has been sacked, with former Houston Dynamo boss Wilmer Cabrera replacing him]</b> Because I <b>[Kevin Gilmore]</b> have so much respect for Remi as a person and as a professional, it was a very difficult decision to make and it was well thought, but our latest series of failures in the past couple of months and the way the team acts on the field led to that change. We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> has been named as the new head coach of the Montreal Impact]</b> We’re very pleased to announce the arrival of this soccer legend. Henry will bring a new dynamic to the club. He shares our vision of how we wish to elevate this organisation and will help us attain our aims on the field, but also away from it. He’s a competitor and a leader, who played at the highest level throughout his career. He’ll bring his talents with him to Montreal, a place where he wants to be</p>

  <p><b>[Why Henry can rebuild his reputation with the Montreal Impact]</b> We were contacted because <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> was interested in coming back to <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> and specifically wanted to look at Montreal. So you get that phone call, you do some homework, you go out, we met with him, spent a lot of time with him and came to the conclusion pretty quickly that he was our first choice<br /><br /><b>[Gilmore is confident that there is both the time and the chemistry to set the foundations for an improved side]</b> <a href="olivier-renard.html">Olivier Renard</a> and <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> connected immediately and basically concluded there was perfect alignment there in terms of philosophy going forward. It was important from Olivier’s standpoint that he bring someone on board as he’s making important decisions in the coming weeks and months, and so we put all of our focus on getting this done</p>
