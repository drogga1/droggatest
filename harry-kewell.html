  <p><b>[It will take some effort from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to stop <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> from claiming a third successive Champions League crown]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are favourites because of their record in the European Cup (Champions League). It is phenomenal. They are going for a hat-trick. The drive of Madrid is going to be very hard to stop. But <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has put together a very exciting, fast, energetic and powerful <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side<br /><br /><b>[both sides known to be more daring in attack, Kewell is looking forward to an exciting game]</b> Hopefully, it lives up to expectations and it will not be a boring game. Hopefully, there are going to be goals in it and everyone is going to be entertained. And let’s hope that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can win. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s recent performances for Madrid has been very good because he has been scoring some goals. I think he scored four in his last five games. He is playing well. He is feeling good. But again, that is going to be up to <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> to make his mind up on who starts. He has a wonderful lineup to pick from. And hopefully, he picks the right team to challenge Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kewell working wonders at Notts County after rough start]</b> I’m very happy with the result but more happy with the performance. We stuck in there in moments when the tide was turning a little bit but then we pounced and looked compact and steady. I’m proud of the players because it’s been a tough week. We’ve got back-to-back wins now and we can push on</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kewell says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need striker &amp; <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> would’ve been perfect]</b> I think they need another striker. I know it sounds crazy because the front three are amazing but I think they need another to test the current front three. I have nothing against <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a>, I think he’s a fantastic player and he does his part. He has scored some important goals and he’s been a fantastic squad player because the front three are a solid front three. I would love to see someone challenge that front three to really keep them on their game.<br /><br /><a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is on fire, at the moment, Salah has been, but he isn’t at the moment. <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, even though I think he does a lot of the dog work for Mane and Salah, he still doesn’t score <b>[enough]</b>. Are there players out there? Of course there is. I would have loved to have seen <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> there. I think he would have been fantastic. I think he’s that type of player. But would you have been able to prise him away without guaranteeing him a place?</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kewell says <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> is the sponge at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that goes around soaking everything up]</b> It is a huge loss, he’s been the sponge. He’s soaking everything up. When he receives the ball, he passes it forward - which many holding midfielders don’t do, that first pass forward to put your team on the attack. It’s a big loss, but I’m confident in the squad that there are plenty to fill in.<br /><br /><b>[The holders of the Champions League crown need to avoid defeat in the final round of fixtures to progress]</b> Not winning it puts them in a difficult position because they are going to have to go to Salzburg and get a result. It’s a Champions League game so a lot of players will want to play it, but he <b>[Klopp]</b> could have rested a few players. He will have been prepared for the worst outcome. It’s good sometimes going to a game knowing that you have to get a result.<br /><br /><b>[There is determination within the ranks to become the first Reds side to claim that trophy]</b> It will be a nice little break for them. It’s still a competition they want to win, so they will take it seriously, but going away in the sun and two games out there, it will be a nice winter break for them. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will know his plan, he’s not going to tell everybody, but he’ll know what he wants to do. Look at the way they are playing, we’re thinking are strikers going to be rested, but they are constantly playing. The players want to play</p>

Harry Kewell has added his voice to those criticising the need to run a rule over every goal when there is no clear and obvious reason for the effort to be chalked off]</b> The Mane goal, I’m surprised. I’m not getting this. I like the VAR when it comes into the right kind of situation but this situation here I don’t get it. For me he’s not offside. I don’t know what part of his body is offside</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kewell says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s defence lacks vision without Virgil van Dijk]</b> When I watch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play, I see Virgil constantly talking to everyone around him. He is always communicating with his full-backs, and the people in front of him. Yes people talk about him being a great defender because he can play out from the back and is comfortable on the ball, but a defender’s first job is to defend - and, in the case of Van Dijk, it is to organise the rest of his defence too. That is what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> missed the most against <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a>. No-one had his kind of defensive vision, or ability to spot danger.<br /><br />Despite their lack of composure at the back, they actually defended pretty well for the most part but one thing I would criticise was the goal they conceded. No-one saw Stefan Medina’s run to the far post, and once he had the leap on <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a>, there was no way Keita could defend it. After that, they did not really defend as a unit when the ball was in the box. I don’t see that happening if Van Dijk is on the pitch. Clearly, they need him back in the team to face <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> - if he is fit, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be calm and comfortable at the back and everyone will be a lot more relaxed</p>
