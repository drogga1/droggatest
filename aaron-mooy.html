  <p><b>[Mooy scored the only goal of the game in the 50th minute at the John Smith’s Stadium and cited the mantra of German manager <a href="david-wagner.html">David Wagner</a> when questioned on the team’s expectations for the campaign ahead]</b> It’s been a great start so far, but we can’t get carried away. It’s very early in the season, we’ve just got to work hard and improve. The boss has a saying, ‘to have no limits’. We all stand behind that. It’s only early but yeah, it’s a great start.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy describes his emotions while meeting a seven-year-old fan battling brain cancer]</b> It was very special to meet Bella. It puts life into perspective, a sick little girl and making her happy. I know the season’s been very tough but bringing Bella here picked everyone up a bit and it made me very happy that she came</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy was sent off after two quickfire yellow cards]</b> It is a painful one that is for sure. They have given everything and when it happens in that manner with the last kick it is particularly heart-wrenching for the players. The sending off has a big influence on the match and until then we were the better team and deserved to be 1-0 up. Second half I thought we played with tremendous courage and quality. I am just disappointed with the result but very proud with us as a team and how we conducted ourselves on the pitch.<br /><br />It’s tough to take because the players were amazing and gave me everything. With 11 players we were really good and worthy of our lead - the sending off affects the game and we played for nearly an hour with a man less, while still contributing to the match.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy joins fundraiser to help fight Australian bushfires]</b> What’s happening back home is terrible, so being able to donate AU$1,000 for every goal scored in the A League and W League fixtures was the very least I could do.<br /><br />Having friends and family being affected by what’s going on in this ongoing crisis is really worrying, and I hope that relief comes very soon.<br /><br />As players, we are in a very fortunate position and are able to raise awareness of what’s going on, so I really hope that our combined efforts can make some sort of difference.<br /><br /><b>[Brighton and Australia teammate]</b> Maty <b>[Ryan]</b> and I will do whatever we can to help in any way, as will all Socceroos players from across the world.</p>
