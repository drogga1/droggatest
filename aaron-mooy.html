  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy named Huddersfield Town’s Player of the Year]</b> It’s been a good year for me personally but the team’s been excellent. It’s great to be part of a good team, and still going, still got games to play and much more we can win. I think I’ve definitely improved. I’m more well-rounded now, there are more parts to my game, so I’m thankful that <b>[manager]</b> David’s <b>[Wagner]</b> given me the opportunity to come and play with the team. I’ve loved every minute so far. It’s not over yet and I’m still hoping it can get better</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy is focused on the present, not his Manchester City future, after helping Huddersfield to the Premier League]</b> It’s hard to speak right now. The penalty shootout wasn’t nice but we hung in there and gave it everything. From the first day they treated me like I was an actual signing, I’m very grateful and glad to be part of it. I don’t know what my plans for next season are yet. I’m just trying to enjoy the night. I didn’t want to talk about it until the season was over.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy is tight-lipped on his future with Manchester City]</b> I can’t say anything. I have to speak to my agent and Man City. I told them to not talk to me for another 24 hours or so! I’m not even thinking about the Premier League yet. I’m just trying to enjoy the day.<br /><br /><b>[Though he says he has not heard personally from Pep Guardiola, Mooy expressed his pride at achieving promotion with Huddersfield]</b> I’m not a manager. I just try my best and see where it takes me. Of course, I’ve always dreamed of playing in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos midfielder Aaron Mooy has admitted he definitely surpassed his own expectations at Huddersfield Town in winning numerous awards as they were promoted to the Premier League]</b> It’s an amazing achievement for the club and for me as well. I’m very proud. You know, the last time the club was in the top flight was 45 years ago or something like that. So to be a part of the team to do that is very special, and I’ll always remember that day.<br /><br />Start of the season, I didn’t really have any expectations because they’d finished 19th last year. So I just wanted to go and try and play as much as I could and enjoy it. Just making the playoffs would have been amazing for them but we got promoted so it was a fairytale. I always wanted to experience 50 games at least in a season because all the top players in the world they do that every year<br /><br />Maybe they’ll <b>[Saudi Arabia]</b> sit off a bit more because they don’t really need to win. A draw would be a good result for them. I’m not sure but whatever way they set up we’ll have a plan to break them down</p>

  <p><b>[Mooy scored the only goal of the game in the 50th minute at the John Smith’s Stadium and cited the mantra of German manager <a href="david-wagner.html">David Wagner</a> when questioned on the team’s expectations for the campaign ahead]</b> It’s been a great start so far, but we can’t get carried away. It’s very early in the season, we’ve just got to work hard and improve. The boss has a saying, ‘to have no limits’. We all stand behind that. It’s only early but yeah, it’s a great start.</p>

But we have six games to go <b>[in the Premier League this season]</b> and we will keep fighting for the club</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Mooy was sent off after two quickfire yellow cards]</b> It is a painful one that is for sure. They have given everything and when it happens in that manner with the last kick it is particularly heart-wrenching for the players. The sending off has a big influence on the match and until then we were the better team and deserved to be 1-0 up. Second half I thought we played with tremendous courage and quality. I am just disappointed with the result but very proud with us as a team and how we conducted ourselves on the pitch.<br /><br />It’s tough to take because the players were amazing and gave me everything. With 11 players we were really good and worthy of our lead - the sending off affects the game and we played for nearly an hour with a man less, while still contributing to the match.</p>
