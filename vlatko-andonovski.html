  <p><b>[Vlatko Andonovski has confirmed his interest in the soon-to-be vacant U.S. women’s national team head coaching position]</b> Is there anyone that is not interested to coach the best team in the world? Yes, I’m delighted to be mentioned as one of the candidates but right now my main focus and only focus is winning on Wednesday and getting one step closer to the playoffs. I’m committed to this team 100 percent until the end, committed to this organization, to the owners and the players with everything that I have<br /><br /><b>[Andonovski has developed a reputation as a coach who is able to get the most out of the talent at his disposal and as an insightful tactical mind]</b> I think one of the best things about him is his tactical flexibility and understanding of the game. He really is not just trying to play just one specific style and live or die by that. He wants to win games and be successful so he’s really good as assessing the team and who’s available and then putting a game plan together for the team to be successful against the other team.<br /><br /><b>[Though the Reign are only in fifth place in the NWSL standings, the 2019 season has arguably been one of Andonovski’s finest coaching jobs]</b> Every time when we felt like this is it, something else happened, and something else happened. I’m very proud of the group for everything that we went through and all the adversity, all the challenges everything that was thrown at us. Not at one point did they feel sorry about it</p>

  <p><b>[Vlatko Andonovski has been named head coach of the U.S. women’s national team]</b> It’s a huge honour and I’m very excited to get started with this group of players and staff as we work towards continued success for this programme. All of the talented coaches and players that have come before have built a legendary tradition of excellence and I’m committed to working very hard to continue to move this programme forward</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT names several young stars to 24-player identification camp roster]</b> One of our main goals heading into 2020 is to expand the player pool, but with Olympic qualifying coming up soon, we don’t have much time to do that, so this camp is a great opportunity for the players and the coaches. For the players, it’s a chance to try to earn invitations to future camps so we can evaluate them against the veteran players, and for the coaches, it’s a very valuable few days to try to add depth to positions where we may need it</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. women’s national team head coach Vlatko Andonovski has named a 28-player roster for the USWNT’s January training camp]</b> The players are coming off their break, so I know everyone will be excited, rested, refreshed and ready to tackle our next goals, which are having a productive training camp and preparing for Olympic qualifying. A long-time strength of this team has been the internal competition on the training field and our coaching staff is looking forward to seeing that during camp as it will help us pick the best team to take to qualifying and try to earn our berth to Tokyo</p>

  <p><b>[Andonovski cuts four World Cup winners as he names 20-player USWNT Olympic qualifying roster]</b> Full credit to the players for competing hard during our January camp and for making our final roster decisions difficult. We have a balanced roster with versatile players and of course they have a lot of experience in important games. This is a team that understands that you have to be aggressive and unpredictable in how you create scoring chances but also knows how to be smart on defense at the same time. They are mature and savvy players who can adjust on the fly if needed and of course are highly motivated to earn that berth to the Olympics</p>

  <p><b>[Vlatko Andonovski explains <a href="mallory-pugh.html">Mallory Pugh</a> omission from USWNT Olympic qualifying roster]</b> Mal was competitive and she did well but there were other players I believe that performed better. I want to be clear that she’s a very talented player, she performed well and she has a big future in front of her so I’m pretty sure if she keeps on developing, going forward she will be on this roster. For Mal, consistency is crucial for being on this roster. She needs to be more consistent in the day to day, which is extremely hard<br /><br />In fact, just because of her potential, I invited Mal to come and train with us even though she’s not on the roster because as a coaching staff, we went to be there for her and provide the best opportunity for her to develop</p>
