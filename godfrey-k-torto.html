  <p><b>[Torto’s ability to spot talent and love of football led him to start up his own community project]</b> A lot of these lads, the majority of them aren’t going to become professional footballers. And that is the reality I paint to them - it’s a very hard game. But if I can guide them, give them advice and just give them that chance where they can be seen.<br /><br />It was really out of the passion of trying to help people. When I was 17 I got released from Chelsea. At the time, I didn’t have anyone who could pick me back up.<br /><br />The reality of it is, I wasn’t released because I didn’t have the ability, it was more just because I was badly advised and I took the opportunity for granted. I just wanted to set something up that gave lads a second chance but then also give boys that maybe haven’t been seen before an opportunity.<br /><br />Seeing Ibrahim Meite last year, not earning any money, not really doing much with his life. Then putting him into non-league, he’s on £70 a week. Then going on trial at Leicester, he’s in the paper. Then signing his first contract, last week I helped him get a deal with Mercedes, he’s got his first car. So, for me to see him develop from that a year ago to this now, I love that. That’s what I do it for</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> scout Nigeria Under-16 captain Babatunde]</b> There are a number of clubs tracking Adeleke Oluwatobi Babatunde’s progress. He is a big talent and I believe one of the next future stars from Nigeria. It’s of no surprise teams are watching him. However, for the meantime, the most important thing is for Tobi to continue the hard work he has been doing by taking things step by step. If he continues to do so, I’m sure he has a bright future which we will guide</p>
