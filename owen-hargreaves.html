  <p><b>[Owen Hargreaves has revealed he was so desperate to continue his <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> career he offered to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for free]</b> At one stage I did offer to play for nothing this season, just to stay on. But they said, ‘You don’t want to do that’ and they were probably right. I don’t blame them for letting me go. I can understand it. There comes a point when you have to say this hasn’t worked out. The game has moved on. See you later, all the best<br /><br /><b>[Hargreaves claims he is now back to perfect fitness and says he does not regret posting videos on YouTube in a bid to prove his injury woes are behind him]</b> It ended up on YouTube because the files were too big to email to specific people, specific clubs. So I put them on YouTube so they could see it. I know it became a bit of a story when people found it in the public domain but I don’t really care. No big deal<br /><br /><b>[Hargreaves has become something of a forgotten man after missing so much football in recent seasons but the 30-year-old is determined to prove the doubters wrong]</b> I’m going to blow people away. I’m coming back believing I can return to the level I was at before. My body feels great and my knees are perfect. I’ve just got this huge chip on my shoulder because I’ve been out for three years and people think I’m dead and buried <b>[…]</b> But right now I’d like to think I can play 40 games this season and with the right care, I believe I can train every day. I hope to be back in the England side for the European Championships next summer. You have to have ambition</p>

For 70 minutes they were dreadful, they really were dreadful - that was probably their worst performance of the season. The first half was a disaster, nothing short of. <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> should have been up by more goals, but he <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> made changes.

Really you would do that with a more experienced player, to come in. That’s not even his natural position, but he wanted someone in there to protect and essentially it didn’t really work. Really, under the philosophy of <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b>, you probably would have thought with the game as it was, there was a fourth goal in it for United. Get the fourth and kill it off. But because he didn’t have that experience in there he put on <a href="axel-tuanzebe.html">Tuanzebe</a> to protect and it went the other way. I really like him, but that last sub maybe didn’t go the way Ole wanted</p>

By the time he got it out of his feet and shot, the ball was already in the net. Defenders hadn’t even really adjusted to the first move, that’s how sharp he was. And we saw that, I think, on the last goal. It just happened so quickly, and he gets it out of his feet, and he shimmies and he shoots almost all at the same time</p>

I know that <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> has been playing well this season, but I think he looks more comfortable with having another ball player who he can get it into on the half-turn. With <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, you saw a connection with the goal <b>[in a 2-0 derby win over <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> - I don’t think that was a training-ground one, it was just pure instinct. City played a high line, Martial recognised the space and Bruno played a brilliant ball over the top. He is just a really good player and good players love to play together. I was saying to Scholesy, when we did a show together a few weeks ago, we are never going to see another <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> but Bruno has that capacity to make everybody else play better and to play football. It looks like the boys are enjoying it. <b>[Nemanja]</b> <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> looks great with him, <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> looks great with him, Anthony has got a partnership there and, really, everybody looks better with him.

I know <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is going to cost a lot of money, but you have a player who, ­potentially for the next decade, is going to be a unique player to watch. Can he become a Ballon d’Or winner? Yes, because potentially he is off the charts. The impact he has had already has been quite astonishing<br /><br />A lot of ­people feel that young ­players will take time to develop. But if you look at players like <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and Jadon now, the great ones, the ­exceptional ones, figure it out. The game of football has become so structured and technical that a kid like him can bring his own style into the game and play with such ­creativity. It’s so hard to anticipate just what he’s going to do. Normally when you watch games of football, you know what is going to happen, whereas, with Jadon, he does things off the cuff almost like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. That’s priceless because he can make things happen when teams sit deep. When there’s no space, Jadon finds space. I think that, like Wayne, put Jadon in the middle of ­whatever the league is in any country and he would thrive. I covered <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s game against <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the Champions League and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> was better than anyone on that pitch -even <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> and ­Neymar.

Just look at <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>. All players have talent, but Pep maximises it. Once you’ve had a manager who gives you that, it’s hard to go backwards.<br /><br />Leroy’s ability is unique and quite exceptional.

If you’re adding <b>[Kingsley]</b> <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Coman</a> on one side and <b>[Serge]</b> <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> on the other side as well - all of a sudden there’s so much firepower. <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, he didn’t play <b>[against Union Berlin]</b> - he’s out injured, but the firepower <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> have is quite remarkable.

If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are missing one thing it is probably a No10-ish player. I know they probably don’t need him because that front three are so good as is the balance in midfield. There are a lot of rumours about <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, even Man United. There are a lot of teams where if I was sporting director, surely his name is on a lot of teams’ lists to come in and make a big impact. The question is, does he do it on loan again or is it a sale, because it doesn’t look like he’s going to stay at Barcelona<br /><br />In a perfect world, I think they hoped it would have worked out but it hasn’t.
