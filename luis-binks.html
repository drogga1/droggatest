  <p><b>[Ex-Spurs youngster Luis Binks opens up on life in lockdown with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> in Montreal]</b> He’s one of the big reasons I came here, so I just want to pick his brains. I was asking him the other day about the best defenders he’s played against - he was telling me all about <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Alessandro Nesta</a> and <a href="lilian-thuram.html">Lillian Thuram</a>. So it’s just me and the manager, there are no new guests coming in and all the others have moved out. He hasn’t invited me down to his room yet, but I bet he’s got the big suite! I’m running up and down the stairs instead of taking the lift - I hope the manager sees me! But even if he wasn’t here I’d be doing all that anyway<br /><br /><b>[Binks spoke about his decision to join the Impact on loan]</b> I told the academy staff I was leaving and they said, ‘We’ll get <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> here’. He said how much he liked me, that I would be going on pre-season and, if I did well, I could play a few games next year. That made the decision even tougher, but it also reassured me that, if I’m good enough, I will get to the top. I needed to push myself, I couldn’t sit around in the U23s, that just wasn’t for me</p>
