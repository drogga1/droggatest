<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ross Embleton spent time working with the England captain in Spurs’ academy system and is not surprised to see him at the very top of the game]</b> I can remember growing up my cousin telling me about the drive and ambition and work rate that <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> had as a player. I remember him saying - he played for Essex with him - that <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> wouldn’t have been in the top four or five players within the group but if anyone was going to select someone who was going to make the most of his ability, it was him. Then obviously what he went on to do, I don’t think anyone would have predicted. I think there are a lot of similarities that you can point towards with Harry on that. He was 17, 18 around the time that I joined <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and the one thing that I used to see is his relentless attitude to work and practice. Some of the goals that you see, where he drives the ball along the grass into the far corner, you used to see him practising those techniques and those finishes over and over again - with and without a goalie. I don’t think you can ever really predict that someone is going to go on to those heights, but what you could see is that he was never going to fall short and was going to make the very best of what he had. I think he has done that in abundance. What level he is going to achieve you can never quite predict, but at the same time you could see that Harry was going to do everything inside of him to make sure he was the best player he could be</p>
