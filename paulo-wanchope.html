<blockquote>
  <p>[Saprissa sporting director Paulo Wanchope saw a Pachuca team that was clearly better than his side in the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League] You can’t interpret it in the wrong way because we did bring in reinforcements, we brought in new players, but these new players also have to adapt to the team and come together as a team. We’ve been in this search for the ideal XI for international competition since December. We looked taking into account injuries and everything. We thought we’d found it, but it wasn’t enough. I think it would’ve been another story if we’d had the team that won the championship. There already was a team, a solid team, but now we have to rebuild.<br /><br />They have three players who make the difference, the three up front and everybody saw it. Hirving Lozano, Jonathan Urretaviscaya and Franco Jara, the truth is they’re very skilled and Pachuca is an organization that already has had time to work together and they’ve got clear goals. That’s why a European club offered $15 million for Lozano and Pachuca still said they were going to wait. Us, in this country, including our club like all the others in Costa Rica, we don’t have this opportunity. You have to understand there are other factors, although they’re going to sound like excuses</p>
