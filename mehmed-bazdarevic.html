  <p>[Bosnia-Herzegovina need to gain three points on Israel in their remaining two games] We have the strength and quality and we are the better team than Wales.</p>

  <p>[Bosnia’s coach Mehmed Bazdarevic believes they have been handed the worst possible draw] My opinion is we got the toughest opponent. Of course we are capable of beating anyone, but it could have been a better draw.</p>

  <p>[Bosnia-Herzegovina coach Mehmed Bazdarevic claimed he was unable to see the game during the second half of his team’s 1-1 draw against the Republic of Ireland] We are disappointed. Our fans deserve a lot more. We’ve had some opportunities in the first half. Second half? Honestly, I didn’t see much of it. And it was very difficult to give my players any directions because I couldn’t see. We will have our chance in Dublin, nothing is lost, our chances are real. I’ve tried a little more offensive, with [Edin] Dzeko and [Vedad] Ibisevic, because every time we have played good in that formation. It is early to say if I will make some changes for the second leg. Of course, I am counting on [Muhamed] Besic.</p>

  <p>[Mehmed Bazdarevic was left dejected by Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Euro 2016 play-off defeat after a controversial penalty decision helped Republic of Ireland to a 2-0 win] I won’t speak about that, but it would have consequences. But I would like to say the referee did not do his job properly in this game.<br /><br />First of all it’s very hard to speak about this. We know what we lost. The team that beat us played very well and had more chances. We played as well as we could, and we tried to match the Irish players in an aggressive game. We did our best. I’m very disappointed about the game. I feel sorry for the fans. During the qualification it was very difficult for us. We had a few players injured and a few cards, but in the beginning we maybe did not have enough luck, and in the end we did not have enough luck</p>

  <p>[Bosnia-Herzegovina coach Mehmed Bazdarevic has called on Uefa to cancel all of the upcoming international friendly matches in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels] To be honest, it would be the best for all if we don’t play against Luxembourg and Switzerland. Uefa, for safety, must postpone all friendlies this and next week. Who cares about football after these terrible scenes in Brussels? This is horrible.</p>
