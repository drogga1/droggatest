<blockquote>
  <p><b>[United keeper Alan Kelly had kicked the ball out of play so that striker Lee Morris - who had been hurt by Gilles Grimandi - could receive some treatment from the physio. At that point, all seemed normal]</b> There was no doubt about it, we thought we were going to get that ball back. It was made clear to us that they were going to give it back to Alan, but then things transpired differently<br /><br /><b>[But a few, including Holdsworth, made a beeline for <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a> - who was celebrating with <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a> in front of the North Bank. The ball was in the hands of <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a> and, when the referee signalled for the game to restart, the midfielder did throw it back in the direction of the visitors’ Republic of Ireland international goalkeeper. The only problem was <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Nwankwo Kanu</a> - just 10 minutes into his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> debut - wasn’t quite on the same wavelength as his new team-mate]</b><br /><br />You could say our reaction was a little bit intense. I was so angry because we had spoken to their players and we all thought they were sending the ball back. So for that to happen and for them to go on and score, it was very hard for us to keep our heads.<br /><br />It was a unique situation. At the time I was furious with <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a>. He didn’t really get a chance to explain himself to be honest because we were a bit aggressive towards him. But he has apologised since, we’ve shook hands and he’s a good guy<br /><br /><b>[The ball was in the hands of <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a> and, when the referee signalled for the game to restart, the midfielder did throw it back in the direction of the visitors’ Republic of Ireland international goalkeeper.

I mean, what can you do after a moment like that? It was pandemonium, I don’t think any of us really knew what to do<br /><br />Steve was a very young manager at the time and didn’t really know how to act. He wanted us to come off, but we didn’t really want to do that so me and Graham Stuart tried to rally the boys.<br /><br />It was all very strange when the game did restart, it was a weird atmosphere and it obviously finished 2-1. But I still think it would have been wrong for us to come off and to be fair to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and to <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, they showed their class straight away.<br /><br /><b>[Within minutes of the full-time whistle, it started to become clear that the story had not ended, with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> immediately offering to replay the game. We don’t want to cheat]</b><br /><br />Arsene did it straight away. It was immediate. He was absolute class. What Arsene did afterwards was quite amazing. And, to be fair to <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a>, he came into the players’ lounge after the game, I think he knew my son was mascot that day and he gave him his shirt and signed it<br /><br />What Arsene did afterwards was quite amazing.
