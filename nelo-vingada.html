  <p>[Former NorthEast United coach Nelo Vingada appointed coach of Malaysia national team] I would like to thank Tunku Ismail for getting in touch with me and then meeting me in Johor recently. It is an honour to coach the national team. There is a lot of work to be done and I cannot wait to get started.</p>

  <p>[Nelo Vingada and the former Asian Cup winning coach wants to see a critical element being installed back into the Harimau Malaya] It’s my great pleasure and honour to be here. Thank you Tunku for giving me the great honour to help. Of course now Malaysia will be in my heart. It’ll my second country. Of course being Portuguese is my blood and family, will always be number one. Our team will be the most important thing.<br /><br />With the help and support of HRH, I believe that with the qualities of players - we need to work hard, we can bring the pride to play for the national team to another level. I’m not the kind of person that promise result because result comes with work.<br /><br />For sure now, my first target is to bring again the pride back to the national team. Tan will of course be working with me. I will also bring two Portuguese coaches with me.<br /><br />To be honest, now I don’t know too much about Malaysian football. Of course, I was following the results, especially the last few one. But now we are here with a clear vision for the future. What is done is done. What I did in my past in a lot of countries is done.<br /><br />The main target is the game that is coming soon against Lebanon. There’s not too much time but with the support of the staff, I believe we can make a good cooperation and be as strong as we can.<br /><br />Coach Tan is now one of the members of my staffs. We’ll be like a brother inside this family. Him being Malaysian, he knows the players and has done well with his club as well. not only the technical staff, there are also others who will be important for the targets we want<br /><br />The philosophy of my football is according to the level and capacity of my players. I can tell you that I don’t have anything in my mind that my team have to play this style or system. Of course in my mind, I like some kind of characteristics. I like fast players, no fear to face one against one, strong mentality and a winner philosophy. I want my players to believe that everything in football is possible<br /><br />If you ask any coach, never the time is enough. Mourinho was my student since he was a young kid, his father was my coach. He’s telling that he needs two years to build the team that he really wants and with 200 - 300 million to buy the players he want. Time in football is something that we cannot have and time is short for any coach. I believe that in September when we have more time to work, maybe we can show a bit different situation than now<br /><br />We’ll gather on 28th and the training will start on 29th. We know Johor will play on the 31st but they will join after their trip to Philippines. On the 2 June, everyone will be there</p>

  <p>[Lapse in concentration was a bigger contributor to Malaysia’s last-minute defeat to Lebanon than poor fitness] Of course, in the last 15 minutes our players were feeling it [fatigue]. But Lebanon are also Muslims, I don’t know how they did it. In the game, during both their goals, our team were organised and everyone was behind the ball, so it is not a question of fitness, it is because of concentration.<br /><br />This concentration problem sometimes [is caused by] cultural attitude. You told me it happens in Malaysian football. Two weeks ago Johor [Darul Ta’zim] lost in the last seconds [against Ceres-Negros FC in the AFC Cup]…There is no special formula, we have to create conditions where players can concentrate more. We talked about fitness, less fitness and preparations can also lead to reduced focus. When the players are tired they are distracted<br /><br />Football is made of these things, anything is possible. It was a hard and intense game. Of course I am not happy with the result, nobody can be, especially because we conceded [the match-deciding goal] in the last few seconds. But I’m happy with the way the players tried to fight and play… They gave everything they had, so they can hold their heads high. Even though we lost, we regained our worth and dignity for the national team. I believe we can do more, we can build from the defeat, and then gain qualification</p>

  <p>[Harimau Malaya to play friendly before Hong Kong encounter] In July the leagues [M-League] will resume and the cup [Malaysia Cup] will kick off, while Malaysia U22 will take part in the 2018 U23 AFC Championship qualifiers and the SEA Games. Of course I will get to do a lot of reference [observation] in July and August. I am happy with the players I have now and if they are selected for the next match in September they will be better, but now I have the chance to watch players in the league and in the [Malaysia] U22 team. I believe we can find more players to join the current squad and form a stronger team.<br /><br />The leagues will take another break in August with the last round to be played on the ninth or tenth, I will give them a four, five-day break. Then in mid-August we’ll start preparations for the Hong Kong game; a training camp and probably one friendly match - home or away - against a team that play with the same style as Hong Kong</p>

  <p>[Vingada looking for new and fresh blood for the national team come August] I’m more clear about the abilities of each players after a month of leading the team. I know what the vision is and what is needed to improve the team. I can guarantee that the national team will be better in the coming months as compared to the past match against Lebanon.<br /><br />For the time being, I’m making preparations for the Hong Kong match in September. By August, I should be able to gather the players that I want. We will have two friendly matches in August to build the understanding between the players</p>
