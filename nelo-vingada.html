  <p><b>[Former NorthEast United coach Nelo Vingada appointed coach of Malaysia national team]</b> I would like to thank Tunku Ismail for getting in touch with me and then meeting me in Johor recently. It is an honour to coach the national team. There is a lot of work to be done and I cannot wait to get started.</p>

  <p><b>[Nelo Vingada and the former Asian Cup winning coach wants to see a critical element being installed back into the Harimau Malaya]</b> It’s my great pleasure and honour to be here. Thank you Tunku for giving me the great honour to help. Of course now Malaysia will be in my heart. It’ll my second country. Of course being Portuguese is my blood and family, will always be number one. Our team will be the most important thing.<br /><br />With the help and support of HRH, I believe that with the qualities of players - we need to work hard, we can bring the pride to play for the national team to another level. I’m not the kind of person that promise result because result comes with work.<br /><br />For sure now, my first target is to bring again the pride back to the national team. Tan will of course be working with me. I will also bring two Portuguese coaches with me.<br /><br />To be honest, now I don’t know too much about Malaysian football. Of course, I was following the results, especially the last few one. But now we are here with a clear vision for the future. What is done is done. What I did in my past in a lot of countries is done.<br /><br />The main target is the game that is coming soon against Lebanon. There’s not too much time but with the support of the staff, I believe we can make a good cooperation and be as strong as we can.<br /><br />Coach Tan is now one of the members of my staffs. We’ll be like a brother inside this family. Him being Malaysian, he knows the players and has done well with his club as well. not only the technical staff, there are also others who will be important for the targets we want<br /><br />The philosophy of my football is according to the level and capacity of my players. I can tell you that I don’t have anything in my mind that my team have to play this style or system. Of course in my mind, I like some kind of characteristics. I like fast players, no fear to face one against one, strong mentality and a winner philosophy. I want my players to believe that everything in football is possible<br /><br />If you ask any coach, never the time is enough. Mourinho was my student since he was a young kid, his father was my coach. He’s telling that he needs two years to build the team that he really wants and with 200 - 300 million to buy the players he want. Time in football is something that we cannot have and time is short for any coach. I believe that in September when we have more time to work, maybe we can show a bit different situation than now<br /><br />We’ll gather on 28th and the training will start on 29th. We know Johor will play on the 31st but they will join after their trip to Philippines. On the 2 June, everyone will be there</p>

  <p><b>[Lapse in concentration was a bigger contributor to Malaysia’s last-minute defeat to Lebanon than poor fitness]</b> Of course, in the last 15 minutes our players were feeling it <b>[fatigue]</b>. But Lebanon are also Muslims, I don’t know how they did it. In the game, during both their goals, our team were organised and everyone was behind the ball, so it is not a question of fitness, it is because of concentration.<br /><br />This concentration problem sometimes <b>[is caused by]</b> cultural attitude. You told me it happens in Malaysian football. Two weeks ago Johor <b>[Darul Ta’zim]</b> lost in the last seconds <b>[against Ceres-Negros FC in the AFC Cup]</b>…There is no special formula, we have to create conditions where players can concentrate more. We talked about fitness, less fitness and preparations can also lead to reduced focus. When the players are tired they are distracted<br /><br />Football is made of these things, anything is possible. It was a hard and intense game. Of course I am not happy with the result, nobody can be, especially because we conceded <b>[the match-deciding goal]</b> in the last few seconds. But I’m happy with the way the players tried to fight and play… They gave everything they had, so they can hold their heads high. Even though we lost, we regained our worth and dignity for the national team. I believe we can do more, we can build from the defeat, and then gain qualification</p>

  <p><b>[Harimau Malaya to play friendly before Hong Kong encounter]</b> In July the leagues <b>[M-League]</b> will resume and the cup <b>[Malaysia Cup]</b> will kick off, while Malaysia U22 will take part in the 2018 U23 AFC Championship qualifiers and the SEA Games. Of course I will get to do a lot of reference <b>[observation]</b> in July and August. I am happy with the players I have now and if they are selected for the next match in September they will be better, but now I have the chance to watch players in the league and in the <b>[Malaysia]</b> U22 team. I believe we can find more players to join the current squad and form a stronger team.<br /><br />The leagues will take another break in August with the last round to be played on the ninth or tenth, I will give them a four, five-day break. Then in mid-August we’ll start preparations for the Hong Kong game; a training camp and probably one friendly match - home or away - against a team that play with the same style as Hong Kong</p>

  <p><b>[Vingada looking for new and fresh blood for the national team come August]</b> I’m more clear about the abilities of each players after a month of leading the team. I know what the vision is and what is needed to improve the team. I can guarantee that the national team will be better in the coming months as compared to the past match against Lebanon.<br /><br />For the time being, I’m making preparations for the Hong Kong match in September. By August, I should be able to gather the players that I want. We will have two friendly matches in August to build the understanding between the players</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia suffered a 1-2 reverse to higher ranked Syria]</b> After 5 days of work in this training camp, what I watched today compared to previous camp, I can say the team is improving. Today, even though it’s a loss and nobody like a loss but we played against a good team in the qualification for the World Cup. They are another level to us.<br /><br />These friendlies games are important to give us options for the important matches. When we start changing some players, maybe the team wasn’t so compact. But it’s my obligation to give chance and to see what some boys can do because nobody can play with only 11 players.<br /><br />Even though not satisfied with the result, I’m happy the players have good attitude. Some players made very good game.<br /><br /><b>[On Kiko Insa]</b> He played one hour and he brought for the team a good balance and a special protection for the central defence, winning many balls in the air and he’s a quality player. But in the last month and a half, he played only one game for Pahang and another 20 minutes. So we can say he lost his rhythm of the game.<br /><br />But if today was an official game, for sure he will play until the end of the game. He will now need to recover but he’ll need more game time to get his rhythm back. Generally I’m very happy with the integration of him into the team which help bring some solutions. I believe also, even though not seen today, he will be threat from corner kicks<br /><br /><b>[On Shahrel Fikri]</b> He’s playing in the Premier League which is the second level of Malaysian football. We had good reference about him and we were following him. Coach Tan <b>[Cheng Hoe]</b> also know him very well. He’s fast but of course it’s not easy for a player coming from the Premier League to play against Syria. During the training camp, he’s improving well and getting along well with the colleague. This means that the national is a house for any player, as long as they are good players and are proud to represent the country<br /><br />I believe the players of the first XI is there. We changed two players today with Kiko and Aidil. Amirulhadi today played more in front, so maybe you can say two new players but three new positions. Now I feel looking at our squad, I feel we have more solutions. Today I was looking at our bench and I feel we have more now. There are some players in the Under-22 who cannot be involved because of the SEA Games but maybe after that, we have a possibility of taking on one or two players from there</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim calls on the support of fans for the crucial Asian Cup qualifier against Hong Kong that can help turn the tide in favour of Malaysia]</b> We have a very crucial game for our target. We are here to develop, to bring better solutions and to change the negative results that have happened in the last 2 - 3 years. And now we are still with the negative results but the performance I believe in all games, we are near to achieve positive results.<br /><br />We’ll do our best to get the three points because it’s the most important. We are getting better and better, especially against Myanmar for best part of 70 minutes, we were in control and good in possession. But to be honest, what is missing in our team is this wish to sometimes to be realistic and play for the result. Sometimes we have to play well but sometimes we have to play for the result</p>

  <p><b>[Nelo Vingada believed Malaysia deserved all three points against Hong Kong]</b> From the games we’ve played, maybe today <b>[Tuesday]</b> was our best game. We created many chances. The speed, the attitude and determination were stronger than the games before. Yes, we also made mistakes. So many times when we were on the counter attack but the players insisted on dribbling when there were other players in better position - maybe now we could be talking about a win.<br /><br />Today was very hard for us because Hong Kong is not so weak as many people think. We lost two points but now I believe we have a team. The players understand my philosophy and the way I work. If we are talking about chance and ball possession, Anyway, we have at least stop losing games and losing in the last minute. Our goalkeeper made a fantastic save, so we cannot say it’s lucky. I think for me, even a draw feels like a bad taste to me because we deserve to win.<br /><br />We are human beings. If we don’t react, people will say we are cold. If this was in Egypt or in Iran, the referee will have a lot of problems leaving the stadium. Here we are very kind. The game is over. Players make mistake, I make mistakes and the referee also make mistakes. Usually when a player or a coach make a mistake, they could be sent away. But when a referee make a mistake, they could still be in charge of the next game. We don’t react, I will say what kind of a shit people we have around me. We have to react. Nobody kicked referee and nobody boxed him. It was a normal reaction<br /><br />If North Korea had won, it would have been the same. Maybe a draw or a loss was good for Malaysia. But the best thing would have been for Malaysia to win the game. The pressure was not more or less because of that result. A loss today would be a six-pointer. But we draw and now it still depend on us. Today had we lost, we would not be out completely but almost. However, I believe we fought well and played well</p>
