  <p><b>[Trevor Sinclair says Leroy Sane would not be a big loss for Manchester City were he to depart for Bayern Munich]</b> The Leroy Sane rumours won’t go away and I don’t think it would be a big loss for the club if they did lose him. I watched him the whole of last season and he didn’t look that interested from the start. Everyone can have their opinion on him, but Pep and his coaching staff watch him every day in training. It’s not just about the performances, it’s about the attitude<br /><br /><b>[One former Three Lions wideman added on current star Sterling and comparisons to a Chilean now on the books at Manchester United]</b> Alexis Sanchez’s stats were very similar to his at a young age. They’ve got quite a similar physique: well-built, quite short, with a lot of power, skill and acceleration. I feel like he’s replicating the scoring ratio that Sanchez had in his young career. It’s like fire and ice, when you’re younger, you’re a bit anxious in front of goal and you let the emotion get the better of you. When you get more experienced, it’s easier to calm yourself down and have great composure in front of goal. When you hear people talk about him, even from his QPR days, it doesn’t matter how many mistakes he might make, he always works his socks off in training. It’s one of the best traits you can have</p>

  <p><b>[Trevor Sinclair says <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> is right at the top of the tree alongside <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> is right at the top of the tree, for me. If he’s not worth £200m now, I’d be surprised. He’s the best player playing for England and he’s the first player on the team sheet for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. The big question now is where do you put him with the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>? I would put him right amongst them. He’s there now. The only difference, and he can’t do anything about it, is time. They’ve been doing it and are still doing it for 15 years and he’s only just started. But if he continues in this form he’s showing, people are going to start talking about him being the best player in the world and I think he’s deserved that honour.<br /><br />If you look at other players who have gone for big money and you look at what they bring to the table, the goals, the assists, the way they conduct themselves off the field – he’s right up there with the very best in the world. I watched him on Saturday <b>[against Bulgaria]</b> and he was walking around and conserving his energy, exactly like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> does for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> every week, and then as soon as he sees a scenario developing he is absolutely electric, he comes alive. His end product and decision-making and productivity he brings to England and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is so consistent, he’s got to be regarded as one of the best players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Trevor Sinclair says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> could turn his back on <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> if VAR continues to adversely affect the competition]</b> The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> has got a fantastic brand and I think it’s been affected negatively by this VAR situation. It’s not a better spectacle now because VAR has been brought in. Pep wants clarity to what the rules are, because at the moment the fans, players and managers haven’t got a clue. This is my fear, that if this continues managers like Pep and the best players are going to start leaving <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />If it continues to be this inconsistent, people are going to start leaving <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and go to different leagues. I think Pep is right on the cusp. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is so good because we get the very best managers who attract the very best players. If you want to go to a top club, you look at who the manager is there. That’s how City have got the players they have got – because of Pep. Now, if managers start leaving <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because there’s no consistency and it’s a flawed system, I think they’re in danger of ruining what they’ve produced over the last 25 years in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Trevor Sinclair says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> would be the perfect candidate to succeed <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> at Manchester City]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is an absolutely top-class manager. For the brand, any club would want him. He says the right things, he’s got humility and you can tell he’s got really good principles. You can tell he wouldn’t have walked away from that job, whatever his contract was he would have finished that contract. How much would he have cost if a club went in to purchase him from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> two weeks ago? Fortunes! And now he’s free! I’m looking at the situation at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and I haven’t heard anything, but <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> looks irritated this season.<br /><br />Not with the club, not with the owners, not with his team. He looks like he’s had enough of VAR. And, he’s been at the club a few years and he doesn’t tend to hang about. If he does walk away – I’m not saying he will – but if he did walk away from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> in the summer, I think <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> would be the perfect candidate to come in and take that hot-seat. I know it’s all ifs and buts. But he is a top, top-class manager and probably every club in the world will be looking at this situation at the moment</p>

Total respect for Sir Alex’s achievements, and of course he’s the most successful, but that’s an entirely different thing. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has changed the way we play and think about the game. From our obsession with direct play to total football <b>[…]</b> and they said it couldn’t be done<br /><br />It’s got to be Pep. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> was unbelievably successful, but when you’re talking about a philosophy and a way to play I think Pep had just changed it up completely. Even the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play to a certain extent – it’s that complete football but with that added press involved. And it’s not just <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, that’s the beauty of it.<br /><br />You look down the leagues and into grassroots football, and even though some of them haven’t got the pitches to play on where the consistency is going to be there in the touch and that passing out from the back, they’re still trying to do it. I think that has come from the football <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have played over the last few years and the success they’ve achieved playing that way. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> was the architect for the kind of football, that philosophy, but Pep has taken on the mantle</p>

  <p><b>[Trevor Sinclair says <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> has become England’s eighth-choice centre-half and something has to change soon]</b> If you look at the competition, it’s one of the strongest areas for England. Obviously there’s <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>, I think <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> has been superb this season, <b>[Fikayo]</b> <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> has been great, too. For me, Mason Holgate probably goes above Michael Keane – just because of the performances I’ve seen him produce at right-back. Then you’ve got James Tarkowski and <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> ahead of John, too<br /><br />I’d be concerned if I was <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> because of the lack of football he’s played. He’s made 17 appearances this season. Just to put that into perspective, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> – who has probably played in too many games – has made 35 appearances. That’s more than double Stones has featured in. The fact that <b>[Aymeric]</b> <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> hasn’t been available this season and Stones still hasn’t featured much sends alarm bells ringing for me. But even more telling is that the youngster <a href="eric-garcia.html">Eric Garcia</a> was on the bench at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He’s a very good young player, but he doesn’t have the experience that Stones possesses. I like him, don’t get me wrong, but the fact he was chosen ahead of <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> for such a big game speaks volumes for me. For me, John is the best English passer of the ball at central defence. Without a shadow of doubt. Technically he’s brave and he’ll always make an angle to receive the ball and his passing range is superb. But evidently things are not going to plan for <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and that has to change soon</p>
