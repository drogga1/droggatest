  <p><b>[West Bromwich Albion Assistant Manager Michael Appleton Delighted With League Cup Victory Over Manchester City]</b> It was a great result. Really positive. Made numerous changes and the lads responded well. We were second guessing their side bearing in mind they have <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on Saturday but there was still a lot of experience in the side. They brought the cavalry on at the end and we were under the cosh for the last 15 minutes but we did enough to win</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom coach Michael Appleton named as new Portsmouth manager]</b> I’m delighted and excited to be taking the job and hopefully I can share that enthusiasm and excitement out around the club. It’s going to be a progressive challenge. You get judged on results and the first team is the most important thing, but we want to build the infrastructure of the club, developing the academy and hopefully along the line getting our own training ground. Things like recruitment will be key. Hopefully, with a sensible approach, we can take the club forward<br /><br />It was very difficult to leave West Brom because I had spent nearly a third of my life there and had made a lot of good friends and worked with good people. But it was time for me to take on a different challenge, and this is one I’m really excited about. Portsmouth have fantastic traditions and the supporters are renowned throughout the football world for being very loud and getting behind the team. We want to give them something to shout about. few years ago Portsmouth were a successful <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club. I would like to think I can help the people at the football club achieve that again</p>

  <p><b>[Blackburn Rovers appoint Michael Appleton as manager]</b> I am delighted to be joining such an historic club. This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I am excited about the challenge we have ahead of us. I can’t wait to start working with what is a very talented group of players. I’d like to thank everyone at Blackpool for their efforts during my time there and the Chairman for allowing me to come here. I wish them all the best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Tyreece John-Jules has joined Lincoln City on loan for the rest of the season]</b> If I said a few clubs were after him, then I’d be under playing it. Again, it comes down to the trust that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have in us as a club and a group to look after him and develop him in the right way. Tyreece can be anything, if the loan goes well, we’re all touching wood that it does, don’t be surprised if you see him playing as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s number nine at some point in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s young striker Tyreece John-Jules has been ruled out for the rest of the season having suffered a broken bone in his foot]</b> It was the day we had the <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> game. He got a kick on the top of his foot. The initial X-ray didn’t show anything, but that can happen with those types of injuries. He then had an MRI scan and last night we found out Tyreece has a slight fracture to the tarsal bone. It looks very unlikely that he’ll feature again this season. It’s a massive blow, for him, for us the players, the squad, everybody. First and foremost, I hope he gets himself sorted as quickly as he can</p>
