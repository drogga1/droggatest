<blockquote>
  <p>[Prasanta Banerjee - Need to start scouting now to aim for 2026 FIFA World Cup] After being 101st, we should get more opportunities to play bigger opponents. Now the AIFF should exploit this golden opportunity and organise more friendlies. Now we should play the middle-eastern teams. The more you play against the likes of Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and UAE, the more you will understand the difference and get to know where we really stand as a footballing nation.<br /><br />We have been playing Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. The next step is the middle-east. Whatever our ranking might be, you will know if the standard of our football has really improved by playing them<br /><br />There is still time. Now it’s 2017 and if we target 2026 World Cup, scouting needs to start right away. Scouting those talents is the most important thing. In India we now have just two scouts. Manchester United has 35 scouts. If a club can have so many scouts, why can’t a nation? This is very unfortunate. Time is at a premium, we need to start from now to aim for 2026 World Cup<br /><br />The coaches were told what to look for a player and how to scout one. Improving the scouting system was discussed in the meeting today, the aim should be the 2026 World Cup, not the immediate future<br /><br />Team preparation will be affected a bit for sure. The transition from one coach’s method to another’s will test the U-17 boys. Now the new coach will have to settle down and he doesn’t have much time. He has to see whether he tours the entire length and breadth of the country to scout more players or focuses on current team combination. India won’t do too poorly in the World Cup. The U-17 World Cup will be a very high level of football, but the team will fight for sure. I am not saying that they could be champions but won’t be wooden spooners as well. We just have to show they world that our boys have talent</p>
