<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pedro Geromel in the form of his life]</b> When I was young, I was always very focused. I knew what I wanted and I went for it until I became a professional footballer. I played for many years in the youth divisions at Portuguesa in Sao Paulo as that was where I had grown up. Then I moved to the Palmeiras youth team, but left after 18 months.<br /><br />I went with a friend to Portugal, but he only stayed for two months. I ended up being there alone, without any friends or relatives. I struggled to adapt, to deal with the differences of culture, the cold weather, the different food and the local customs. At that time, I lived in a room above a restaurant in the city of Chaves, where I played for six months as a youth-team player, and then for a year as a professional until I moved to Vitoria Guimaraes where, thankfully, I would gain a reputation for being one of the best defenders in the country<br /><br />I moved to Germany to play for FC Cologne, who bought me for €4.5 million, and I had the opportunity to play in one of the most competitive and attractive leagues in the world. I spent four years in German football, which is spectacular. They had new stadiums, transformed by the 2006 World Cup, and they were always full, which makes every game special. The quality and intensity of the matches were the biggest differences I felt this time<br /><br />I worked with Jorge Mendes for 10 years and I am very grateful for everything he has done for me. One day I was at his house and we had dinner with Cristiano Ronaldo. Cristiano was a very nice person, he was very humble. He deserves every success he has ever had<br /><br />I moved on and played for a year on loan with Real Mallorca in La Liga. It was a great experience. I got play against Lionel Messi. The statistics said I was one of the best defenders in the league<br /><br />When I had the chance to go back to Brazil and play for Gremio, I didn’t think twice. When I was introduced, I knew I would have to gain my place in the team by showing what I could do and so that’s exactly what I did. After 10 years in Europe, to be able to return to Brazil to be closer to my friends and family and still play in a great team like the Gremio, and to <b>[win the Copa do Brasil]</b>, has been phenomenal<br /><br />I had the opportunity to live in Portugal, Germany and Spain, and I was able to learn the languages, customs and curiosities of each place to the fullest. I just like people<br /><br />I was at a kid’s party with my two daughters and I was kind of paralyzed for a minute. It’s an extraordinary feeling to be able to represent my country. I’ll never forget the moment I got the call. So many people over the past three years have helped make this dream possible, and I tried to go to each one and thank them personally<br /><br />Tite is distinguished, he’s so prepared and conducts himself in the correct manner. He always tries to help and facilitate our work on the field, and does everything he can to help us prepare away from the pitch<br /><br />Brazil is very well served with defenders and so I must prepare myself to be always at my very highest level here at Grêmio. And if they need me in the national team, I will be right here, always ready to help</p>
