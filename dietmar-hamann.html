  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk will relish the challenge of facing Romelu Lukaku]</b> I think he will. He is probably as tall as him, think he’s probably as quick as him, and I don’t think Van Dijk minds a physical challenge. You know you can never keep him out the game for 90 minutes Lukaku, because he is just too powerful and too quick and too strong for that. But I think Van Dijk will stand up to that challenge. The less service you give Lukaku, or the less you can stop the people giving service to Lukaku the better.<br /><br />I’m not sure whether he has got the impact he had got three years ago. I think he’s in his late twenties now, he is a very physical player, you have to see how long he can play at a very good level or the top level. And I’m just not sure whether he is the same player that he was when he first came to Arsenal<br /><br />I think again against United you have to be patient and I don’t think United will approach the game any differently to when they did at Anfield. They do sit back, they like to play deep and play on the counter attack. And I think Mourinho has always been like this. He doesn’t concede many goals, or his teams don’t concede many goals, and I think patience will be key because when you’ve got a lot of possession against United then I think the most dangerous thing is always to think we’ll be fine, we won’t concede, now let’s commit one or two players more forward, and I think this is where they can hit you</p>

He is still under contract with Arsenal and says that he has no more buck and likes to sit in the stands. He is still paid by the club and has a responsibility. I find that disrespectful to the fans, his team-mates and the coach. The club is up to its neck at the moment and then you have one of the captains who sits down and says that he no longer wants to play for the club. Whether he is the right person to give young players values ​​such as identity and loyalty next year, I have my doubts.<br /><br /><b>[Hamann did appreciate Mertesacker’s honesty]</b> Everyone perceives the pressure differently.

More often than not that’s been disappointing in recent years.<br /><br />I feel for first time there’s a level of consistency in the team and the club.

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been told he can be Liverpool’s answer to Steven Gerrard in the Champions League final]</b> Everything Salah touches this season turns to goals - but in a game like this I would have to go with the old man <b>[Ronaldo]</b> because he’s done it so many times before. Salah has had an incredible season - and the hope at Anfield is that he’s got even better years ahead of him. But while the future belongs to Salah, the here and now still belongs to Ronaldo, a player with a proven track record. This is, however, an opportunity for Salah to really make his mark at the highest level. It doesn’t get any bigger than a Champions League final against Real Madrid, who are probably the most iconic club in the world. If Liverpool win then I think that Salah would become favourite to land the Ballon d’Or. But if you are asking me who I would rather have in my team at this moment in time then I would have to go for Ronaldo<br /><br />If you want to win big trophies then you need your big players to step up when it matters. Liverpool have got other big talents like Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino - but Mo Salah is THE man. In that respect, he can inspire Liverpool against Madrid like Steven Gerrard did when we played Milan. If you are a goal or two behind - or three, like we were in Istanbul - you see someone like Gerrard alongside you and you know you’re still in the game. You know that you’ve got a team-mate with a special talent, someone who can create a goal out of nothing, or produce a bit of brilliance to get you back in the game. It’s hard to describe what kind of belief having those game-changing players in your team gives you. If you’ve got a goal-scorer of Mo Salah’s class in your side you know you’re never out of the game. It’s like having a talisman. Steven Gerrard was one - and Mo Salah can be one</p>

We don’t have to discuss that he decided the final with his two mistakes. Something like that can happen to a professional footballer. But what I didn’t like was his behaviour afterwards.

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann does not believe that Mohamed Salah will leave the Reds for a club like Real Madrid or Barcelona]</b> I just don’t see Salah following in the footsteps of Suarez and Coutinho. For South American players, signing for Barcelona or Real Madrid is a huge thing for them to do because of the links to their culture. I haven’t met Salah, but from what people have told me about him he seems to be someone who loves being loved like he is by the Kop. I think that he has found a home, somewhere he is respected and appreciated, and he’s also working with a manager who was brave enough to pay a lot of money for him when others looked at what had happened at Chelsea.<br /><br />Klopp has brought the best out of Salah and he is now No.1 at Liverpool. At Barcelona and Real Madrid, unless you are Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, then you just another good player. I think the emotional side of football is very important to Salah. If he is happy - and he looks to be very comfortable at Liverpool - then he strikes me as a player who will be very loyal. I don’t think it is any coincidence that the shackles have come off playing for Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. It just looks like a perfect fit. When you become a hero at Liverpool, the fans love you like you are a member of their family. I don’t think that should be underestimated if a club like Barca or Real tried to sign him</p>

If we want to play a role at the World Cup, he is one of the most important, if not the most important players in the team. The hunt for Ozil was not so bad for some players, they could just hide behind him. If it works, everyone is happy. If it does not work, Ozil is guilty. And if he did nothing, no one else did anything. There is too much talk about tactics and system, the Mexicans were just more aggressive, more powerful and the Germans were surprised by their class. We played naively, everyone wanted to play with the ball, no one without a ball.</p>

  <p><b>[Dietmar Hamann slams Germany after shock World Cup elimination]</b> Towards the end, with that <b>[Manuel]</b> Neuer incident, it bordered on embarrassment, because this is not how German football has been represented over the last four or five decades. I got knocked out in the European Championship group stages <b>[in 2004]</b>, but you’ve got to conduct yourself in a certain way and they didn’t do that. For me, that’s the disappointing thing. They lost leadership, they lack players they can really rely on when the chips are down and that’s on the pitch.<br /><br />They will face huge criticism. The team manager Oliver Bierhoff didn’t really handle the Erdogan thing before the tournament well. The manager <b>[Joachim Low]</b> extended his contract before the tournament for another two years - so he has four years left. It will be very interesting what the thoughts of the DFB are. So there are a lot of questions. Last year we thought we were unbeatable for the next decade after winning the Confederations Cup and within 12 months we’re back down to earth</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool and Bayern Munich midfielder Dietmar Hamann thinks Bayern will be nervous heading to Anfield]</b> It was the draw Bayern didn’t want. Getting Liverpool was probably the hardest one out of the hat in terms of facing one of the second-placed teams. Liverpool have been going strong in the Premier League. They had a couple of average games after the turn of the year but they came back to form against Bournemouth. On the other hand, you have a team in Bayern Munich who are very fragile at the moment. Even when they do control games they give away a lot of chances and goals.<br /><br />With the defence they <b>[Bayern]</b> have got at the moment, I’m not sure they can play an expansive game against a side with Liverpool’s quality and pace going forward. As good as Liverpool’s forwards are, I still think Van Dijk is their most important player. He’s a leader, he delegates, he speaks to players and he organises. He makes other players better and not having him out there is a huge blow. It’s an opportunity for Bayern and they will get chances but I can see them defending pretty deep at Anfield. With Van Dijk back, I’m not sure whether Bayern have the capability to put three or four past Liverpool in the second leg.<br /><br />I think if Bayern want to have a chance in the second leg they need to score and they must not lose at Anfield. They should be aiming for a result that means they don’t have to win at home. If they have to force the game against Liverpool with Van Dijk back and that front three playing on the counter-attack, we know the damage they can do. Bayern aren’t in great form but they are a hugely experienced side. They have some of the most decorated players in the history of German football with Champions League winners and World Cup winners. Bayern’s hope is that they raise their game for the big occasion</p>

At home to Lyon, the possession stats were 51-49 in their favour so Liverpool will definitely have more of the ball than they might have envisaged a few seasons back. I would suggest that Liverpool’s attacking unit is probably a better collective than Barca’s at the moment with Reds’ old boy Luis Suarez not at his very best. And Suarez and Lionel Messi need to find a way past one of the best central defenders in the world in Virgil van Dijk, who will receive excellent protection from Fabinho, who’s looking more and more like a top holding midfielder.<br /><br />Don’t get duped into thinking there will be goals galore in this.

Sometimes you just come across a freak and that’s what De Ligt is - a 19-year-old who is built like a 25-year-old and plays like a 30-year-old. He has led <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> into some of football’s cauldrons this season and is an absolute born leader. He is the man who can carry Kompany’s baton forward.<br /><br />He arrived from Germany having been at Hamburg and I warmed to him straight away and not just because he spoke good German. He always had it in his mind that he wanted to be a holding midfielder but I was on at him straight away that because of his attributes - comfortable on the ball, good in the air, built like a beast - that he could become an absolute world-class centre back. And I wasn’t just saying that because I didn’t fancy any more competition for my position! Anyway, I was right because he has turned into one of the great centre-backs and he won’t just be missed for his abilities as a player but also because so many players look up to him. He inspires them. Vinny is truly one of the nicest people you could meet in the game. Had he not made it you’d have said it was because he was too nice for this cut-throat game of ours</p>

He’s got an incredible forward line with <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>. He’s developed probably the two best full-backs in the world in <b>[Trent]</b> <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> and <b>[Andrew]</b> Robertson. Buying Virgil <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> was a bargain even at £75m because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s problems over the last 30 years have been caused by defensive vulnerability.<br /><br />A great team must avoid two things. The first is complacency, but even with a 25-point lead at the top there was never a sense of taking it easy. The second is a fighting spirit, and this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team never lies down. That is all down to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. He has built a team of brothers who refuse to let each other down.<br /><br />I’m a believer that the very best teams are the ones that bounce back from big disappointments - and that has been a mark of this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. Like last year when they got 97 points and lost the title by a point. To then win the Champions League and follow that up by winning the league for the first time in 30 years is phenomenal. I remember when Jurgen first arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and he said his job was to turn doubters into believers. He hasn’t just changed the mindset of the players, he has altered the attitude on an entire city and fanbase. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has given the fans a realisation that a season only matters after 38 games. He won’t rest on this. He will look to build from a position of strength. I can see him bringing in two or three top-class signings to keep the squad hungry</p>

  <p><b>[Kai Havertz: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> favourites to sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder]</b> A lot of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs will be interested in <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a>, he’s a terrific player and there’s not many better around at the moment. If you look at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it’s very clear they need new personnel going forward, and I think he’d improve pretty much every team. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a bit different with the way they set-up and play, but besides that he improves every team. Before the break people were talking about three figures, a hundred-odd million, if that’s a price any club is prepared to pay in the summer, I’m not sure, but the likelihood is he will leave Leverkusen and take on another challenge in the summer.</p>
