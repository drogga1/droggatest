  <p><b>[Aitor Karanka bemoans Uefa’s decision not to act on Real’s claims of gamesmanship by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s players. One of them is <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> who allegedly called <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> Monkey]</b> The match has been overshadowed by Uefa’s resolution - it’s on another plane now. We have been punished <b>[with the suspensions for Pepe, <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b>, but there are <b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> players who didn’t respect the principles of fair play or who made racist insults, covering their mouths, who will be on the pitch. We say over and over there are double standards</p>

  <p><b>[Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka says it would be an amazing achievement if his side were to survive in the Premier League]</b> It would be amazing to survive. To come three years ago into that situation and to finish in the Premier League competing, especially when everyone can watch us competing, we have to be proud. As a coach, the main thing is when your players are doing their best. When I said we are here because we have to know we are tougher, it’s the same for the crowd. They knew it was going to be tough and difficult. The last home game was amazing, and they were amazing at Tottenham. They know the players need them and if I have to ask them for something, it’s to help them.<br /><br />After that game we’ve improved a lot. It’s difficult to score goals and create chances, but we’re improving a lot, and we’re competing against every team. We realised how difficult the Premier League was that day <b>[when Boro lost 3-1 at Everton in September]</b> because we competed against Everton in the second half, but for 15 minutes in the first half they were much better than us and we couldn’t compete</p>

  <p><b>[Nottingham Forest vs Stoke]</b> It is just a question of my decision. I need to check how the players who played in the last three games are feeling and try to put the best XI on the pitch. We have to keep in mind that we have played three games in one week, before this.</p>

  <p><b>[Santiago Solari faces a tough task trying to emulate Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid]</b> He’s showing that he has personality. He has his idea. From what I hear, from what I know about Real Madrid, there are always some people who want some player to play and others who want another to play, and I’m seeing that he has his idea. And the team is winning. If Santi is the one who is there, we have to support him and give him all the strength and credit, because being on that bench is complicated. Hopefully, if he cannot do what Zizou did - which would be difficult - he can launch the team and make them win again.<br /><br /><b>[Karanka feels the criticism has been unfair]</b> Yes, but in the end, the success of Ernesto is to be what he is like: to transmit that normality in everything. What Ernesto is doing is very good, and in the end he is himself. If you coach such big clubs with that magnitude, although I was not in the front line like him, and you keep maintaining that naturalness and that normality, that’s already a success for me<br /><br />In football, as a player, you are saying: I want to play in Alaves, then in Athletic, then in Real Madrid, then the national team, then win the Champions League. You can have those dreams as a child. But as a coach, on Saturday you are preparing for a game against Millwall, you lose two or three games and after dreaming about training Real Madrid, Barcelona or a Chinese team, you end up being fired and then you have to return to zero. I think the important thing is to grow, to learn every day and then time will decide where you end up<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what he has taken from those experiences]</b> I think it has been about taking a little from each one. We are talking about three very different coaches. I was with Jupp Heynckes when I was 20 years old when he came from Germany, and he changed the mindset at Athletic, we started playing the ball more, and we qualified for the UEFA Cup. With Vicente Del Bosque was another style: try to play, with his personality. And Jose, that aggressiveness, that organisation. I was already thinking about being a coach and he was the one that, more or less, makes you take the final step. I was already beginning to take notes of what I would or wouldn’t do and how I would handle each situation</p>

  <p><b>[Aitor Karanka says <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is attractive for any club]</b> He is a young striker and he scores goals. It is clear that he has everything and even more at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. He is no longer a player who comes from playing in a minor league. He arrived at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and scored important goals, both in the league and the Champions League, and I think what makes him even more attractive is his price tag. I think that any big club is eager to bring in players who score goals. When there is a young player, with goals and at that price, which I think is not very high either, he is attractive for any club</p>
