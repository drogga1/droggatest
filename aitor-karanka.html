  <p><b>[Aitor Karanka bemoans Uefa’s decision not to act on Real’s claims of gamesmanship by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s players. One of them is <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> who allegedly called <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> Monkey]</b> The match has been overshadowed by Uefa’s resolution - it’s on another plane now. We have been punished <b>[with the suspensions for Pepe, <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> and Jose Mourinho]</b>, but there are <b>[Barcelona]</b> players who didn’t respect the principles of fair play or who made racist insults, covering their mouths, who will be on the pitch. We say over and over there are double standards</p>

  <p><b>[Aitor Karanka says <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is attractive for any club]</b> He is a young striker and he scores goals. It is clear that he has everything and even more at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. He is no longer a player who comes from playing in a minor league. He arrived at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and scored important goals, both in the league and the Champions League, and I think what makes him even more attractive is his price tag. I think that any big club is eager to bring in players who score goals. When there is a young player, with goals and at that price, which I think is not very high either, he is attractive for any club</p>
