  <p><b>[Teenage Estudiantes defender Juan Foyth has responded to claims he is set to join Tottenham]</b> I like competitive leagues more than anything. I always watch the Italian, English, Spanish leagues. The leagues that they normally show on TV here in Argentina<br /><br /><b>[On the Tottenham reports]</b> I read this on social media. Something about my agent or Veron had traveled there. I don’t really know what they said. I haven’t heard anything about that. I will try to speak with my agent when there’s something more concrete. I have never spoken with <b>[Mauricio]</b> Pochettino or with any person from Tottenham<br /><br /><b>[Foyth also revealed that he would not be joining compatriots Leandro Paredes and Sebastian Driussi in moving to Zenit]</b> My agent never told me that an offer had arrived from Zenit. I would not go to Russia right now. If I do go it is not because I want to, but rather to help the club out economically</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham have completed the signing of young Estudiantes defender Juan Foyth]</b> It’s a club that bets on the young and I think I’m going to have a chance to play. I also spoke with Mauricio Pochettino and I liked what he said. It was what helped me decide that Tottenham was the right place to continue my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Foyth admits nerves contributed to a shaky start at Tottenham, with the youngster having gone from playing FIFA at home to training with the likes of Harry Kane and Dele Alli]</b> It’s been a really good first 16 months for me. I’m really happy to be here. The staff and my team-mates are good people so I’ve been enjoying every day, every moment I have here. I’m here because this is a big club. We have a lot of strong players and the staff have great plans for every player - that was a big factor in why I signed for Spurs.<br /><br />When I arrived I was very nervous because one day I was playing FIFA at home and the next I was training with the likes of Harry Kane and Dele Alli, so it was a big change for me. My new team-mates have had a big impact though and they helped me a lot. I might have been nervous initially, but they received me well which gave me a lot of confidence and meant I could enjoy my time.<br /><br /> think I was a different player at that time to what I am now. I wasn’t really fully prepared to play in the Premier League back then but after training extensively with players like Davinson <b>[Sanchez]</b>, Jan <b>[Vertonghen]</b> and Toby <b>[Alderweireld]</b> and against such quality forward players that we have here, I think I have learned a lot in that time<br /><br />The last few months have been incredible for me. I’ve really enjoyed it recently, but I can’t stop. I have to keep working and keep improving every day. I think I have improved a lot in the time I have been here. It was a good decision I feel, to come here. I’ve got a great bond with my team-mates and I’m enjoying every moment here</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Juan Foyth has revealed Mauricio Pochettino was the reason he decided to join Spurs ahead of Paris Saint-Germain]</b> More than anything I decided on Tottenham because there was an Argentinian manager and support team - or they can <b>[at least]</b> speak Spanish - and because it was a club that supported young players a lot. Also, I had the chance to talk to Mauricio and he told me I had very good features but that he was going to improve that. He was a defender as well so I thought he might have very good recommendations and advice to give me. He <b>[Pochettino]</b> told me it’s a situation he had been in. It happens, so I think he could understand in that sense because he’d been out there, in that same position as me<br /><br />I started playing as an attacking midfielder but as time went by I grew taller, because I was quite short, and maybe I lost a bit of the dribbling ability I had. That’s why gradually I was moved to a defensive midfielder and then ended up as a central defender when I was 16. It’s late, no? At the time I was happy because when we played small-sized games I always said, ‘I’m Rio Ferdinand’. Then when I started to play there it was hard because I didn’t touch the ball much - but after a few games it was normal and I enjoyed it. Maybe it’s given me a bit more confidence on the ball. But the problem is that when I played in midfield I wanted to take the ball every time, so maybe I have to be careful. I looked up to Rio Ferdinand very much. I used to like his physical strength. Another player I used to watch a lot was Lucio - I paid attention to his style. When I was younger, Kaka was my idol because I played a bit more forward and he played in the same position</p>

We must not change everything quickly. We have to get his idea slow and I think to me and to all the players he tried to give us confidence and see us all happy. From the first day he arrived he started to talk with all the players individually and with the squad, and I think that helps</p>
