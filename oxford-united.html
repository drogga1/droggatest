<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Oxford United confirm two positive tests]</b> Those involved will now be off site and asked to self-isolate for 10 days as a precaution. Neither had symptoms and can exercise independently within the current guidelines while they are away from the club. The medical team will be in contact with them on a day-to-day basis and all players will still be completing their daily medical questionnaire and temperature checks, with regular testing continuing. The club has notified the necessary medical channels and the EFL and all measures have been taken internally to ensure that the highest levels of safety and hygiene are maintained throughout the club. We have thoroughly reviewed everything we have been doing this week and are satisfied that everything has been done with player and staff welfare as a priority. We have learned to be flexible and we will adapt once again but the message to all the fans is to respect the guidelines that we are all living by right now, and most importantly, stay safe</p>
