  <dd>American tycoons George Gillett and Tom Hicks offer £435 million for the ownership of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. This includes £215m for the building of a proposed new stadium on Stanley Park. The club’s board, led by chairman <a href="david-moores.html">David Moores</a> and chief executive <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>, unanimously recommend that this offer be accepted. <a href="david-moores.html">David Moores</a> sold his 51% majority shares in the club to the current owners - American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks</dd>
  <dt>2007 02 06</dt>
  <dd>The offer from George Gillett and Tom Hicks is accepted, valuing the club at £218.9m (£5,000 per share), and confirming debts of £44.8m. In their original press conference, Gillett promises work on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s new stadium would begin immediately, saying: ‘The spade has to be in the ground within 60 days’</dd>
  <dt>2007 05</dt>
  <dd><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are beaten by <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> in the Champions League final, with Hicks promising afterwards that serious funds will be made available to manager <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a> with which he can strengthen the squad. It results in the infamous soundbyte: ‘If Rafa said he wanted to buy Snoogy Doogy we would back him’</dd>
  <dt>2007 11</dt>
  <dd><a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and the owners fall out over the Spaniard’s transfer targets for January 2008. Gillett and Hicks reportedly tell <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> to ‘concentrate on training and coaching the players he already has’. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> responds with a frosty press conference in which he repeats that phrase in answer to every question. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s form, impressive in the early weeks of the season, begins to deteriorate.</dd>
  <dt>2008 01 14</dt>
  <dd>Hicks admits the club had made an approach to former Germany manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Juergen Klinsmann</a>, with a view to <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> replacing <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> as manager. The meeting took place at the height of the feud between <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and the owners in November. Hicks says, however, that such a move was ‘an insurance policy, to have him become manager if Rafa left for Real Madrid’.</dd>
  <dt>2008 04</dt>
  <dd>It emerges that Gillett and Hicks are barely on speaking terms, throwing the club into turmoil. <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>, it transpires, was present when Gillett and Hicks met with <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> the previous November, further souring his relationship with <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>. Days later, Hicks rounds on <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a>, accusing the chief executive of failing in his commercial and professional duties, and advising the termination of his contract. <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a> would leave his role at the end of the following season.</dd>
  <dt>2010 01</dt>
  <dd><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans are left incensed after Tom Hicks Jnr, a board member at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, responds to an e-mail from a supporter with a foul-mouthed tirade. Hicks Jnr is forced to resign, with commercial director Ian Ayre and financial director Philip Nash added to the board.</dd>
  <dt>2010 03</dt>
  <dd>Reports surface suggesting a bid of £110m has been made from the Rhone Group - a New York-based private equity firm - for a 40 per cent stake in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Gillett and Hicks fail to respond to the offer within the deadline.</dd>
  <dt>2010 04</dt>
  <dd>Gillett and Hicks announce the appointment of British Airways chairman Martin Broughton, who will oversee the formal sale of the club as soon as possible. The Americans’ statement reads: ‘Owning <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club over these past three years has been a rewarding and exciting experience for us and our families. Having grown the Club this far we have now decided together to look to sell the Club to owners committed to take the Club through its next level of growth and development’</dd>
  <dt>2010 05</dt>
  <dd>Sunday Telegraph reports that Dubai International Capital were close to a £500m takeover prove wide of the mark. The group that initially missed out on buying the club to Hicks and Gillett and were believed to be ready to commit funds for player transfers and for a new stadium.</dd>

  <p><b>[Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks says Club does not need to sell <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> or Fernando Torres]</b> I’m disappointed because I think we’ve done everything we can to improve the club in so many ways over the past three years from the way it had been run before.<br /><br />I think we have a great management team now led by <a href="christian-purslow.html">Christian Purslow</a>. The commercial director Ian Ayre has done a great job. We have a strong financial director in Philip Nash. We’ve grown our sponsorships from £40 million annually under the last year of Moores’ ownership, to this coming year we’ll do close to £100 million, so all those extra sponsorship revenues are resources for the club to use to support the wage bill to be competitive<br /><br />We have no intention of selling any of our top players. We have a substantial transfer budget in place. There’s so much misinformation about transfer spending. It’s more than doubled under the ownership of George and myself from the past three years and we will make significant investment this summer, but it’s really about getting the right players. We will sell the club. We’re not going to sell it to the wrong group, we’re not going to sell it for the wrong price. We’re going to take our time and do it in a very thoughtful way and try to find the right steward to own <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. We hope it gets done by the end of the calendar year. I don’t anticipate that it will be done necessarily before the beginning of the next season. I think £600-800 million is not an unrealistic value range but, you know, the market’s the market. We’ll see. sWe’re more concerned about finding the right next owner, somebody that can make the investment in the club to get the stadium built and let <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club be the best possible football club in the world.</p>

  <dd>In a bid to retain control, co-owner Tom Hicks attempts to refinance the £237m debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland. If unable to find fresh credit, the Texan could be forced to relinquish his investment on October 15. Reports emerge on September 19 that a £280m package had been agreed with private equity firm Blackstone. A large-scale campaign from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters follows and the company announces the following day that they had no intention of concluding a deal to leave Hicks stranded.</dd>
