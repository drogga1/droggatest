  <p><b>[Rennes head coach Christian Gourcuff has slammed the proposals of Marco van Basten to abolish the offside rule]</b> This is the worst crap I have read a long time and yet I did not read it wrong … It’s immeasurable bullshit. We would return to the time of village vs. village, and at the time it ended with players being killed. The offside is a manifestation of collective intelligence. There would be no more collective spirit if the offside rule was removed. The offside rule is fundamental - if you do not understand that, you do not understand football.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chelsea can wait - Meet Ligue 1 Rising Star Joris Gnagnon]</b> He puts his physique to good use, but he also reads the game well and his technique means he’s capable of bringing the ball cleanly out of defence. For me, he’s an ideal defender. He seized his chance when it came, he’s improving all the time, and he has a big future.<br /><br /><b>[Gourcuff said of the Gnagnon’s attitude]</b> He’s very humble and has everything you need to succeed. We’ve extended his contract, we know that he’s the kind of player we need to keep if Rennes are to grow in the coming years</p>
