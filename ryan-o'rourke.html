  <p><b>[<a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a>]</b> The Dublin born man went on the RTE show in November after he returned to Ireland following a 1,497 day stint in an Egyptian prison. <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> was arrested in Cairo in August 2013 on the Muslim Brotherhood’s so-called Day of Rage but was cleared of all charges last September<br /><br />An RTE spokesman told Independent.ie: ‘The Late Late Show interview with <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> was his first major television interview since his release from prison. It was a wide ranging and lengthy interview about his experience, including the varied reaction in Ireland to his imprisonment. As such he was given the opportunity to address and clarify a number of longstanding rumours surrounding his case which had been widely circulating during his imprisonment. Mr Halawa was aware in advance of the interview that he would be given an opportunity to address those rumours</p>
