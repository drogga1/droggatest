  <p><b>[Albert Puig on Seung Ho Paik]</b> The football world has changed, of course La Masia is going to as well. We were amazed with the talent in that team, but above all with Paik. We did not waste our time and we took him into the Infantil A team<br /><br />We did not waste our time and we took him into the Infantil A team. Lee had some big offers from England but his obsession has always been making it in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, which won out over money. We have to take it step by step and let their own progress in the game determine their rise in La Masia’s structure, not the opposite. Paik has undergone an incredible physical growth in the last two years. But he still has to work out definitively what is his best position in order to use his talents most effectively. <b>[Lee]</b> is a far more electric player, he has to play up front or as a second striker to utilise his speed and great ability with the ball at feet</p>
