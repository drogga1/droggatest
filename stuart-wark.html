  <p><b>[Felda United midfielder Stuart Wark is hopeful that B. Sathianathan will guide them to a strong finish in the Super League and the Malaysia Cup]</b> So far it has been good for me, I’ve learnt a lot. When I first came to Malaysia I was playing in a more attacking role, as a striker. But since coming to Felda, I’ve been playing as a defensive midfielder, doing quite well, enjoying it and learning a lot. My teammates have made the transition very easy for me, I have exprienced players beside me such as Fazly <b>[defender Norfazly Alias]</b> and <b>[defender and skipper]</b> Shukor Adan. The coach has done a great job and in helping me. Everyone is happy with him, and hopefully <b>[from]</b> the results of the last few games - we’ve won the last two, drawn a lot - things are looking a lot better. Hopefully we can continue to keep the performance up, get more points on board, maybe concentrate on getting a good run in the Malaysia Cup. Hopefully get in the final, we’ll see how it goes.<br /><br />If he had had his own players to bring in, had been able to make the decisions from the start, I think yes, things would have been different. But it was not meant to be, so I think he’s making the most of what he has, and now he can bring in some of his players<br /><br />For me, I still don’t understand how we failed to qualify <b>[from the group stage]</b>. Against Ceres at home we dominated them from start to finish. But in the away game we missed a penalty in the final 10 minutes, and an open goal scoring chance in the last five. If we had put one of them away, that would have given us another three points. And against Ha Noi they scored a last-minute goal <b>[equaliser]</b>. That’s another three points we should have had. If we then had another draw, that should have been enough for us to qualify<br /><br />It’s difficult. We know the structure <b>[at the Malaysian FA]</b> has changed, TMJ <b>[new president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> is now in charge. A lot of players from Johor have come out of retirement, so it’s difficult. For me, anything is a bonus with the national team. I just want to play every week with Felda. If it happens, it happens, if it doesn’t I’ll keep enjoying my football, I’ll keep working hard and I’ll always be available</p>
