  <p><b>[Rafinha has returned to his native Brazil with Flamengo after eight years at Bayern Munich]</b> The eight years have been wonderful, I’ve had some great moments here. The treble in 2013 was special. All things come to an end eventually. We are together every day and know each other so well - we are a family. The friendship we all have is the greatest thing</p>

  <p><b>[Rafinha hopes Neymar returns to Barcelona to reestablish the pure magic of his combination with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez]</b> I hope Neymar comes back. He is a great player that would be really good for Barcelona. I have never seen anything like the Messi-Ney-Suarez trident, pure magic. And I hope Antoine Griezmann comes, too. I see myself in Barcelona next season and I will fight to continue. I want to play football and Barcelona is my home, I have a contract with the club and I have a lot of confidence.</p>
