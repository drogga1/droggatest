  <p><b>[Barcelona have announced an agreement with Inter Milan over the loan of Rafinha for six months]</b> I’m really happy, it’s a great feeling to be here. It’s an important stage in my life and I had a lot of desire to approach this new phase in my career. There have been a lot of important players at Inter who have made history. I want to do my best and give everything to finish as high as possible and win titles with this shirt. I hope to play in as many matches as possible and help the team to reach our objective which is Champions League qualification.</p>

  <p><b>[Rafinha stressed the Germans’ respect for Brazil]</b> Everyone knows that Brazil look very different now, that we have restored the joy, are playing good football and are now a favourite. Players at Bayern and all over the world know that Brazil are back.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Rafinha is eager to tackle Inter in the Champions League]</b> It wasn’t expected. Painful is not the word for Inter’s decision. I had a few months there in which things went very well, I regained confidence after a long injury. My team-mates and the fans made me feel very comfortable, like I was at home. It was a busy summer and because of the uncertainty of what was going to happen it wasn’t very clear. Things were changing, but I was at home, comfortable at being with the best team in the world<br /><br />I felt like a footballer again and I was happy doing what I like the most. For me, it was an incredible experience. I was surprised I enjoyed it so much. My team-mates were excellent, the squad was fantastic. What stayed with me is the passion the fans have. It reminded me of how they experience football in Brazil<br /><br />There were times last season when they were better away than at home. When I played, it was a team that changed a lot. So I think anything could happen<br /><br />If they don’t count on me in January, then the best thing for me and them would be a way out. But I’m happy here. I want to play football. I don’t care how and where. If I’m physically well, I’ll be prepared for whatever comes</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Rafinha says he is close to reaching a deal to join Flamengo]</b> There is mutual interest. We are about to reach an agreement. Some details are still missing. But I hope we can resolve this as soon as possible. I want to make it clear that Flamengo is my first option when I return to Brazil. I have seen the whole Flamengo project and I really liked it. I still want to win titles and I saw the opportunity with Flamengo.<br /><br />My cycle at Bayern is coming to an end. There are many things that can happen in the next six months, but I think it’s my last year</p>

The friendship we all have is the greatest thing.<br /><br /><b>[The former Schalke defender has made just 26 appearances in all competitions]</b> I do my work and train well, but the coach does not count on me. I do not know why. I have not made any problems. But of course I am disappointed</p>

That’s why my mother said that I should say thank you for everything, to all employees and players. These people are very important to me</p>
