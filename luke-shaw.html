  <p><b>[Luke Shaw has insisted he does not view his selection for the Under-21 squad as a punishment]</b> I spoke to Roy <b>[Hodgson]</b> about it and he rang me the week before it came out and said it’s not a punishment or anything like that. I haven’t been playing, so it’s for me to help out the Under-21s. I’ve been talking to the manager and we’ve spoken about and think it’s a great idea for me to go to help out with the Under-21s and get some game-time as well. It’s not just me. We’re all happy to help. It’s always been a privilege to play for my country, no matter what level it is and I will do it and do my best.</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw says he always knew he would be ready to play his way back into favour at Manchester United]</b> I’ve always, especially recently, felt really confident, and I knew I was in a good moment fitness-wise with the work I’d been doing. And I knew when my chance would come, I’d be ready. I just want to kick on now. I’m not looking back, I’m only looking forward. I’m feeling good and it’s been really nice to be back on the pitch and enjoying having game time. The last few weeks personally have been good but, as a whole and as a team, we’ve been disappointed with some of the results <b>[over Christmas]</b>. But I hope there are many more games for me and many more good results for the team as well<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho has added his voice to the praise being lavished on Shaw of late]</b> It’s really nice to hear. The manager has been really good with me and has given me extra confidence. He’s just told me to go out and enjoy the games and that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m just focused on working really hard for the manager and for the team because I want to keep on playing and hopefully more games will come<br /><br /><b>[On an unfortunate double leg fracture suffered in September 2015]</b> A bad injury like I had always stays with you a little bit afterwards but it’s in the past and I feel really good and really fit, and my leg feels perfect. Body-wise and fitness-wise I probably feel the best I’ve ever felt. Mentally, I feel very strong as well and I’m enjoying my football, and it’s now about pushing on and helping the team</p>

One of the best in the world, the quality he’ll bring to the side will surely boost our attacking threat<br /><br />We’ve already seen his quality in training and some of the things he’s done are a joke</p>

It was nice they were doing so well and it was amazing, but you sit there wishing you were there. That’s another thing pushing me on more because it’s horrible sitting there when you’ve been there and you want to be there even more</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw admits that Manchester United conceded stupid goals on a sad night against Tottenham]</b> You look at the first half and I think we were outstanding. We had a lot of chances to put the game to bed. Of the chances we had, <b>[we should have scored]</b> maybe one or two, then for me it would have been ‘game over’. We spoke at half-time and Jose said they hadn’t had one corner, one cross or one dangerous opportunity. Then, from their first corner in the second half they had a goal <b>[from Harry Kane]</b>, but even then we should have been relaxed because it was only one goal and we still had a lot of time. But then came another mistake, another silly, stupid goal. We were so on top and it is just really disappointing, everyone in the dressing room is really sad, especially after the first half we had<br /><br />It is a sad night for us, we have got to pick ourselves back up, keep working hard and we need to pick up points after two losses. We need to win and win in a good way. We played really well in the first half and if we keep playing like that, and take our chances, then we will win games. You see a lot of things in the media that go on about what our dressing room is like, but we have a really good spirit, a really good group of lads who want to work and achieve big things here. We have a group of hard workers and amazing talents, everywhere you look on the field. We have got to start taking our chances and I am sure we will start winning games</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw believes Jose Mourinho has never wanted to sell him at Manchester United]</b> He <b>[Mourinho]</b> put his trust in me at the start of the season. I think at times if he didn’t trust me it would’ve been easy for him to say he wanted to sell me. I think he always believed in me and I always believed in myself and just needed to get back to what I needed to do. He’s played a big part but I’ve done a lot too to get back into his team and earn his trust back.<br /><br /><b>[Shaw added on a battle to prove his worth to Mourinho]</b> It’s been a tough two years but mentally it’s made me stronger and made me want to prove to him that I can do what sometimes in the last couple of seasons he said I couldn’t. I’m feeling positive and feeling good and focused on what’s to come. I think at times he got frustrated with me because he knew I could do better. Maybe he was right but I don’t want to keep focusing on that. We had a chat before the season and he said he wanted me to stay. That motivated me a lot and obviously I’ve come back and played games in pre-season and got my fitness fully and everything is good<br /><br />I’ve always believed in myself. I’ve had hard times but to be the best, you’ve got to be professional. That’s what I’ve learnt and especially from the staff at Manchester United, I’ve learnt a lot. I just need to look forward now, keep professional, keep training hard, keep improving myself as a player, keep doing what I’m doing at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has revealed that he almost lost his right leg after suffering a double fracture during a Champions League clash with PSV in September 2015]</b> I’d be lying if I said I didn’t sometimes think about stopping playing football, but I had a lot of good friends and family around me and they helped me through it. I nearly lost my leg, I was actually really close to losing my leg and I never knew that until six months after when the doctor told me. Of course, if I knew that I would <b>[still]</b> never have stopped, even if he had told me there was a worry, I would have tried <b>[to carry on playing football]</b>. I want to be playing football, I want to be playing in the biggest games possible, winning trophies - that’s my motivation, and like I said I want to be known as one of the best full-backs in the world.<br /><br /><b>[Shaw added on how close he came to having his leg amputated]</b> At the time, they were thinking about flying me back <b>[from Eindhoven]</b> and if I’d have flown back, I would probably have lost my leg because of the blood clots and stuff in the leg. I’ve got - I don’t want to talk about it too much - two scars down the side of my leg where they had to cut it open and pull them out because of how severe it was. But I don’t really care about that anymore. I feel really strong - and my right leg is exactly as it was before my leg break<br /><br />Yeah, you could say that is fair. In periods of time when things were going really good, that’s when I might have taken my foot off the pedal and got comfortable. Maybe at times I wasn’t carrying on to the next level and that’s where I’ve changed from a kid to a man and I have realised that. Now I’m back in the England squad, I have to keep going and take that criticism on board</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Luke Shaw pulled no punches in rating his side’s 3-1 defeat at the hands of West Ham]</b> We have to look at ourselves as players. We’re the ones who go on the pitch. The manager isn’t on the pitch is he? If you want the truth I think it was honestly horrendous. We didn’t look like a team that was going to beat West Ham. I think individually and as a team we were awful. That’s not good enough. It’s hard to take and we’re sorry to the fans for what they saw<br /><br />Obviously at half time there were a few words and I think it was needed. It was wake up and words that he’s said before: we need to be moving, we need to concentrate more, we need to want the ball, we need to be playing. That didn’t happen. It’s disappointing and a very, very bad day for us. From the first minute you could see we weren’t winning the second balls and our duels. It’s hard to take. It just wasn’t good enough from us. That shouldn’t be happening. Games like this we should be dominating, creating chances, showing people why we deserve to play for Man United and that didn’t happen. It was very poor from us. Very, very poor</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s half-time team-talk was a kick up the arse]</b> If I’m honest, yeah, 100% <b>[I could see it turning around]</b>, as soon as we came out in the second <b>[half]</b>. I felt as soon as it kicked off, something inside me was meant to be. We were meant to come back, meant to win. A lot of strong words were said at half-time in the changing room. I think everything that was said was correct, and what we needed. To be 2-0 down at half-time against Newcastle at home was really bad. It helped us. The changes helped us. We came out a new side, what we should be like every game. There is no reason we shouldn’t be like that - the quality we have, which I’ve said in the past we have but we’re not utilising. At half time, I’m sure there were a lot of happy people around the world loving every moment of it, but the team spirit is very strong in here. The half-time team talk was very strong, but it was needed and gave us a kick up the arse, you could say. We came out different, the way we were much better in the second much quicker and more direct, and more like the United in the old days.<br /><br />The fans were amazing, they pushed us on. They were a massive factor. Especially with the bad results, they’ve been really good to us. You could say this was payback but we should be winning these games. It’s a good day for us and a good win that was much needed before the international break. It’s now most important to remember that second half, to keep that with us, and keep doing it from the start, and keep that momentum, hunger and passion. We should be wining more games comfortably</p>

We’re Man United and that’s what we’re known for. And today I think it clicked really well and you saw a lot of that today - and a really special goal I feel in the third goal. Great passing, movement, and a great finish to go off with it. We kept our composure even when it went 2-1 and we kept doing what we needed to do and we did that amazingly today and well done to all the team. There’s things to look forward to now and we need to keep going and do what we did today.<br /><br />A very good result after, obviously, a tough week for everyone at the club. But this weekend was looking for a reaction and I feel the lads played really well today, and it’s nice to get the three points that we really needed</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw insists Kylian Mbappe and Paris Saint-Germain have not put a massive dent]</b> I think this will now be our biggest test. Obviously, we’ve been winning and winning really well. We’ve had a couple of tough away games which we’ve won and now we’ll see how we adapt to a loss as we haven’t had one in a while. We’ll see how we go into the next game and we want to win that one. It’s the most confident I’ve felt within the group in a long while, especially before the PSG game, as I felt so confident in the team. What we have been doing is very positive with the mentality going into that tie but it wasn’t our day. But we’re all very confident and we take that into training every day. The results have been showing that. Look, we can’t take one loss as a massive dent to us. It’s just a learning curve and we go again.<br /><br />These are the games you want to play. You’ve got to beat the best teams in the competition to win it and it’s better to do it now, and get them out of the way. We know what we need to do against Chelsea as we had the game there earlier in the season and I felt we played really well and were unlucky not to get the win. We’ll remember the positives from that game and take it into Monday. They’ve been going through a rough patch and will be looking to put things right against us. It’s such a big game for them to do that but we’re the same. I don’t think anything else other than it is a very hard match, a tough game to have, but we’re ready for it.</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw considers Manchester United’s interim boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> to have overseen an amazing job]</b> It’s just amazing to look at the job Ole has done since he came in. How much he has turned it around and how much the place is in a positive way now. You know, Ole does it at the right time <b>[shows another side to him]</b>. He knows how good we can be and, if we’re not up to his standards or the standards of Manchester United, he will certainly let you know. We’ve had a few moments like that where we might have been comfortable in a game but got a bit sloppy. He’s the manager and he tells the players what he wants. It’s good and what we need sometimes, a kick up the backside from the manager, if we’re getting too comfortable. It keeps everyone on their toes but he’s an amazing guy and a brilliant manager.<br /><br /><b>[On arch-rivals Liverpool]</b> This is the biggest and best game to be involved in. Of course, we know how well they’ve been doing and how big the rivalry is between the two clubs. It’s one that everyone wants to be involved in. It’s always close to your thinking because of how big it is. It’s a really exciting thing to think about</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw has revealed that the Manchester United dressing room was in turmoil at half-time against Liverpool]</b> We were all very disappointed with how the first half. We didn’t play well at all. We gave too many balls away too cheaply and luckily that didn’t cost us. But we had a change of formation, we had a good chat at half-time. Everyone was going crazy. We said ‘relax and we just need to play our game’ and I think the second half was better. We still weren’t at our best but overall I think we created the best chances and I feel we should have won<br /><br />We all know how unbelievable Liverpool’s attack is and I don’t even think David (de Gea) had a save. So, that’s credit, not just to the back five, but the whole team for doing their job. These are the games that you want to try to step up in - you want to try and prove why you’re here. You want to play against the best, you want to test yourself against the best and I want to keep doing that in my career. I think I’ve still got another level to come. I don’t think I am really at my best and I know what I can do when I’m at my best</p>

We have to pull off something special, but I feel that we’re capable of it. I am really positive that we can go there and get a result and get through to the next round.<br /><br />Most importantly we need to make sure we don’t concede, especially early on. I feel if we get one goal then it’ll make the tie completely different. They’ll feel it and it might change the game completely. It’s a long time, 90 minutes, and you never know what can happen if we get that early goal and our confidence goes onto an even higher level. I feel we can do it with the way we’re going at the minute, especially away<br /><br />We just need to defend well and when we get our chances, take them. We did it away to Juventus, a very tough game, and very few people do that. We just need to think about the good things we did there and take that to Paris with us. We’ve got such amazing attacking players. Players that can create and players that can score wonderful goals and I’m sure we’ll have a strong enough squad</p>

Like I say, we are really enjoying everything that is going on at the moment and I think the results have shown that. We have had a couple of blips but I think it is nine away games now <b>[that we have won]</b> and they have not been easy ones, so that shows what a job Ole and his staff have done. Long may that continue<br /><br />That is not down to the players to decide. If you look from the outside, you would say ‘why not?’ - he has been fantastic since he has come in. He has given everyone a breath of fresh of air and I think the way he has gone about the job has been unbelievable and the achievements we have made in a short space of time have been fantastic.

I know the fans were really hurt, but we as a team were very hurt. Last season was a massive disappointment. How other teams were doing as well - especially over the period when we had time off and there were teams winning trophies. It was really tough for all of us to take and you couldn’t really enjoy your holidays. You see the Champions League final and the Europa League final and they’re all English teams - it makes you feel even worse and especially the way the finals went. None of us want that to happen again. I think that’s why we’ve all come back again with a different mindset and of course we had that break to clear our minds, but now we’re all focused on getting United back to where they belong<br /><br /><b>[Shaw says that change of approach has given the squad fresh impetus]</b> They won’t have it as easy as last season. People are probably already doubting us, but they can carry on doing that. For me and for us as a team we know what we are capable of doing and we will have a much better season than last season. We need to get back to winning ways, we need to be lifting trophies - let’s start the season right and hopefully we can start off with a good run and keep that spirit going. We all believe massively in the squad, the manager and the staff. We want to put last season behind us. This pre-season has been really tough for everyone, physically and, at times, so hard mentally. But it is helping the squad massively.<br /><br />Ole is more focussed on keeping the ball, playing out from the back and keeping possession. A lot of times last season we didn’t do that well enough. We’ve worked a lot on tactics, pressing-wise. When to go, what sort of moments. The other side of that is to keep the ball. Just to keep the ball more and play as a big team, a good team. We want to be winning games, but with possession as well. He’s made his ideas clear</p>

It hurt even more that there were so many English teams around us who were playing in finals and had done well while we were just on holiday. There was nothing we could do about it other than watch the games and think. Of course, it hurt. We all felt it. We have a lot to prove this season and I am sure we will. We are going to have a much better season<br /><br /><b>[After reflecting on a positive pre-season campaign which saw United win all six of their summer fixtures]</b> We have worked very hard and all taken it in a positive way. Now we are all benefiting from it massively. We feel good and fresh. The players seem more energetic. I look at my team-mates and I feel like I see more hunger in them than last season. Everyone wants to prove a point. We are working on things in training so we have more of an idea now on how we want to play and what the manager wants from us. That is what we needed, for the manager to show us how he wants us to play. I feel we are ready and I can’t wait</p>

Sometimes it’s easy for people to forget what I’ve actually been through. You need to have a thick skin to play football anywhere, but especially at the biggest club in the world here at United. Everyone’s watching and wants to have a go whenever you lose. They’re just waiting to criticise the moment anything goes wrong but that’s part and parcel of playing for United. No disrespect to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> who are a fantastic club, but they’re not exactly having the greatest of seasons and it’s hardly mentioned. I find it quite funny that if it’s United, everyone criticises, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> don’t get a mention. Look, we know when we haven’t been good enough and at times we haven’t been. We all know why we’re here. We’re here to take this club back to where it belongs - winning trophies and challenging for titles. And I honestly believe we’re on the way towards doing so. We know when we’re not at our best and we know when we play well what we can achieve - but we have to sustain it that’s why I believe there are a lot of good days to come<br /><br />We’re all aware how the manager has tried to take the criticism on himself this season. We admire him for that, but there does come a time as a player when you have to look at yourself and realise that it’s all on you. The manager can’t keep defending us and taking the criticism. It’s up to us now - we’re the ones who need to shoulder the blame and start performing on the pitch. Ole is different to managers I’ve played for in the past at United who have not been slow in criticising us. Every manager has their own way of doing things and as a professional you just have to accept that they believe that the best way to be successful is their way.<br /><br />In the dressing room he always lets us know if we aren’t doing the thing he expects from us. But there isn’t a lot he can do once we go out onto the pitch. Then it is down to us. Ole can only do so much to prepare us but once the whistle goes then it’s up to us to prove we deserve to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players. We’re all here because the manager believes in us and it is disappointing there have been times this season when we’ve let down him, ourselves and the United fans. We know we’re much better than our results suggest. The good thing is we’ve still got a lot to play for, with top four and two cup competitions, so there is time to put it right.

If you look back at all the games we played, I can remember only one mistake, for the penalty at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, and that has literally been it. He has been a solid eight out of ten in every other game he’s played, never puts a foot wrong, puts his foot in the right position every time and, for me, he’s the best one-v-one defender in the world. No-one can get past him, he’s really improved that side of his game and his attacking side too. You can see Azza is learning each day and wanting to learn more too.

Every time I’m facing Anthony, I like to have a little joke around with him, talk to him a lot and tell him: ‘I’m coming for you’. Actually, probably the hardest player to get the ball off is Paul. He’s so big, strong, he’s got quick feet. To be fair, he’s got everything to be the best midfielder in the world. You could ask any player in the team about that.

The way he could play the ball through the lines or in behind, he wasn’t afraid to try things.

He’s clearly a natural goalscorer. This season - even though he doesn’t start all the time - his goals return and his stats are great, and he’s got some assists too. For someone so young, in their first season, he’s done brilliantly. He’s still got so much to learn, but if he carries on working hard and pushes himself every day then I don’t see why we can’t see him turn into another <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> or a player of that style that’ll score lots of goals for us<br /><br />Purely the fact that he’s so two-footed, it’s unbelievable. When I was younger, when I played youth football, there was a young lad called Lewis Baker who played with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he was always both-footed. Him and Mason are probably the only two pure two-footed players I’ve seen. When I was at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> could also use his left and right very well. Also Ravel Morrison was very strong on both feet and we’ve seen a lot of people talking about his potential in recent weeks, but I’d say Mason is stronger on that front</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw is looking to help <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to major silverware and inspire the next generation of supporters, much like his own boyhood idol <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> once did]</b> How big the club is and how successful it’s been in the past, I think <b>[is what]</b> inspires all of us, especially the ones that are there now. We’ve seen how good and how great it is when the club’s winning trophies and we obviously want to get to that stage and inspire young people, like I once was, watching United win a trophy. The squad, the group we have, is amazing. Everyone gets on great and we all love each other and we all want to push each other towards that goal of winning trophies. On the other hand, my family and friends I’d love to celebrate with and hopefully I’ve got times like that to come and I can live it in real life.<br /><br />Obviously I would have to go towards a left-back and one I watched a lot. For me, he was probably one of the best left-backs ever in the game: <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>. Like I said, I watched him a lot and I wanted to become a player like him. I was lucky enough to go to an England camp with him and it was amazing to be around someone I idolised so much and I watched a lot of him and he was the player I wanted to be like when I grew up</p>

He was paired with Paul in a small training group last week, which people saw on the videos, and we saw flashes of what they were capable of.

I felt like I was really flying at that point in my career, I was feeling really confident and obviously nobody ever wants to break their leg in a game! It’s obviously a long time on the sidelines and you have times when you feel down. You feel a long way away from where you want to be, you don’t feel right, your leg doesn’t feel right, and you go through those periods, but the most important thing is to look towards the end of it. See the goal and focus on that. You’re going to be back playing, training, and that pushed me a lot of the time, watching the lads playing and training. There are times when you don’t want to be involved, but it’s good for you to be around everyone to keep involved. You don’t want to be forgotten, you want to be around it.</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw says <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> earned &amp; deserved <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> extension]</b> All the players are really happy for him. Obviously his situation was up in the air and we try not to talk about that kind of thing at training but we’re just so happy for him. Before he arrived, a few people outside the club weren’t too sure what he was going to bring to the club, but he’s shown everyone because he’s brought goals and a different style to our other strikers. He’s earned and deserved the chance to stay here longer. He brings happiness and a smile to the place. He’s great in training but he’s also been really important at times during games and scored some great goals. Now that everything’s sorted, hopefully he can relax now and settle back into doing what he was doing before football stopped<br /><br />The last time we played an actual competitive game was against LASK in Austria, when obviously there were no supporters in the ground, and I suppose that was sort of a trial run for how things will be here when we get back to playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. For me, fans are first and foremost; the atmosphere they make is what football is all about and we’re definitely going to miss having them at our games, both at a packed <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and the amazing away support that follows us everywhere. We love our fans and we’ll miss them, but it’s far more important that we don’t bring them back too early in the current climate. We’ll have to create our own atmosphere on the pitch through the people we’ve got on the sidelines, and it’s useful that we’ve got a couple of weeks now to get it into our heads that it’s going to be so different to what we’re used to. We need to be ready for it. We’ve had that taste of it already against LASK and we can use that to our advantage</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw reveals he scored twice in 4-4 <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> friendly draw as <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> &amp; Fernandes also on target]</b> We had a great 11-a-side training game on the <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> pitch over the weekend and it was eventful! There have been a lot of different things circulating on social media and I’m happy to set the record straight: it did end 4-4 and I did score twice! Also on my team, Bruno <b>[Fernandes]</b> got one and Jamo <b>[<a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>]</b> got one, while, on the other team, Rashy <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>]</b> got two and so did Odion <b>[<a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>]</b><br /><br />To be fair, my first goal was decent. It was from a great cross by Bruno and my volley went straight in. I was happy with it. My other one was just getting forward, Juan <b>[Mata]</b> played it to me on the edge of the box, I took a touch and shot in. It was quite an open game, as you can probably gather, with a lot of space, since it was the first game back. Everyone looked good and the most important thing was getting minutes in the tank. This was definitely a step forward from the games we’ve been having at the training ground<br /><br />It was also our first chance to get used to a silent <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, which was different. We all felt like it made the pitch seem bigger because the stands are totally empty. Sometimes during games the fans push you on when you’re tired, but now we’ve got to get to grips without that support. It was a really valuable exercise to be able to play at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> without that. We were creating our own noise around the stadium and that’s something we’ve got to make sure we do. The important thing is that it’s another step forward. It’s getting more and more exciting now and we just want to get playing games. We’ve got a couple of in-house games at the training ground scheduled over the next few days, which will help us step things up even further before the big game next week against Spurs<br /><br />It’s a massive fixture and I think everyone on both sides has got full-strength squads now, so it should be a really good game. It’s definitely one we’re all looking forward to. In training, we’re looking really sharp, really fit and ready to go. We’re looking forward to it. We just need to pick up where we left off, doing the things we were doing before the break, and, hopefully, we can climb towards the Champions League spots, which is what we really want</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> looks unstoppable]</b> He’s improved greatly from when he first came on the scene, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch as well. He’s matured so much. He’s really turned into a man and I think everyone’s seen the way he’s conducted himself off the pitch; especially during this pandemic, he’s been unbelievable. He’s a massive example to everyone. He’s matured so much and a lot of credit for that goes to him and also to his family, who have kept him very grounded<br /><br />He’s a big inspiration for a lot of young people, especially the ones who are coming through from Manchester. In Marcus, they’ve got someone to look up to not just on the pitch but off it too, which is really nice to see. As a player, he’s improved so much but he always wants to learn, always wants to get better and, to me, he’s getting better every time I see him play. He’s looked unstoppable at times this season and he’s looked so confident. I haven’t seen that in him before. He was always confident, but not to this level, and he’s matured so much. He knows he has the ability to be one of the best and he’s pushing himself all the time to maximise that. There’s no reason why, if he keeps going, keeps pushing himself, that he can’t win it (the Ballon d’Or) one day.</p>

  <p><b>[United team-mate Luke Shaw says <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> has been an unsung hero in United’s recent success]</b> Nemanja I think has still got legs in him. He might be getting towards the older stage now but for me he’s been a massive part of the recent results we have had. He’s a big part of that midfield and he’s really stepped it up in the last few weeks and been a key player for us. You don’t get the plaudits all the time. Other people in the team are getting the goals and assists, but he’s a massive part of why we keep clean sheets and the solidity that we have in front of the back four. It’s nice to know he’s there cleaning everything up</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Shaw says this is the most confident <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> side he has played in]</b> Over the past years, it hasn’t always been the most exciting and we have not always played as well as I feel like we are at the moment - especially in my time here. This is the most confident <b>[we have felt]</b>. Around the training ground and on the pitch now, the confidence is so high and we are going into games now full of belief. A big turning point was going 1-0 down <b>[against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> the other day. In recent times we would have struggled with getting results, but I think that is a sign that we are going in the right direction. Of course we are very happy with how things are going but of course there is still room for improvement we all believe<br /><br />The manager has done a brilliant job. Of course the players he has brought in, the group of players now, we all get on really well and I think there is a great happiness in and around the training ground each day. Everyone is smiling, everyone is enjoying each other’s company and I think that is important to have a successful team. Everyone wants the same thing and gets along with each other and I can see a big change in the group not just on the pitch, but with each other off the pitch too<br /><br />For me, Bruno is a massive part of the change, the culture that is now going on at United. He pushes that day in, day out. <b>[He is]</b> an amazing guy off the pitch, he’s funny and he has massive confidence in his own ability, which none of us doubt. He’s been perfect on the pitch. The whole team has changed I believe. The injuries we had also - Paul <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> and <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> - have also come back and hit the ground running in this part of the season. Everyone is pulling their weight and doing a great job.<br /><br />The growth that Mason has made in the last year-and-a-half he has been in and around the first team is amazing. For me personally, I feel like he has turned from a kid to a man in such short time and now he’s understanding what this league is about. He has grown in size, he has got stronger and he is not fragile anymore. <b>[Before, he]</b> could be pushed off the ball. The most important thing I would say for him is ignore the hype, ignore what people are saying, just focus on yourself, keep doing what he’s doing and there is no reason why he can’t become a very important player for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the future. He can become a United legend, no doubt about it.<br /><br /><b>[Top four our biggest priority]</b> It’s great <b>[but]</b> we don’t want to get too comfortable with it, we want to keep pushing ourselves. We believe next season will be a very good season and we have got big priorities to obviously reach the Champions League. We are still in two cup competitions that we believe greatly that we can win. As long as we all stay fit and we keep doing what we are doing, I don’t see why we can’t achieve these things. Top four - Champions League next season - is the biggest for us. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is one of the biggest clubs in the world. We need to be in the biggest competitions and I think the games we have left, they are winnable. If you look at the start of the season, I think these are games that we didn’t get points in or struggled in. Hopefully we have turned our fortunes around and we have learnt from what we weren’t doing back then and we feel confident with our run in that we can get maximum points and I don’t see why we can’t</p>
