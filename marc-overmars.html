  <p><b>[Overmars reveals United sealed Blind deal by email]</b> In the past, a transfer like Daley Blind’s to Manchester United was precluded by lengthy negotiations. We did not even sit down around the table now. The entire transfer was done by email. When Manchester United agreed to meet our asking price, I asked our financial director and legal department to deal with the paper work and that was it. That just goes to show big clubs like Manchester United do not get overly worried about such big transfer fees.</p>

Not even for an insane amount. They should play about 40 games for Ajax first in 2018-19.<br /><br />De Jong to Barcelona? He is not for sale. And I have communicated this to all parties involved. It’s the same for Matthijs. Clubs that are interested are free to come back next year. Of course, Davinson Sanchez’s move last year showed that it is not always easy to stand firm. But we have now reached a point where we simply say that we are not selling these players. They are still only 19, 20 years old. I have told these players and their agents that a transfer after this season could be an option if the right offer comes in.</p>

There is absolutely no chance, regardless of any offers that could come in.<br /><br />We also know that some of our players have reached a certain level where it becomes impossible for us to hold on to them, though. We know that. I think we could be talking about three to four players, but we obviously want to lose as few players as possible. It’s not like we will sell all of our key players. But Europe’s five to six biggest clubs are in attendance for some of our players on a weekly basis</p>

Players at Barcelona stay for five years, at Ajax, no longer. What energy it cost us to keep the current team together. We had to go through those qualifiers last summer. If that had not gone well then I would have had them here one by one at the door. And even if you manage that, then you know it’s only for one year<br /><br />You get to the <b>[Europa League]</b> final, but can you continue with that? No. The team falls apart, key players leave.

No, I’m joking, but if he was really interested in coming back to Ajax, I would go to Barcelona the next day to speak with him. I think one of Suarez’s biggest qualities is his mentality. The power to win, to score goals… he is one of the best in the world.<br /><br />It’s important for Barca to have players like De Jong. With his talent, at his age, he could become a Xavi or an Iniesta. <b>[Barcelona]</b> have to bring through their own players and mix them with good players from elsewhere. De Jong’s not Messi, there’s only one <b>[Messi]</b>. But he’s a player that fits in really well at Barca. I’m excited to see him there next season</p>

Arsene Wenger arrived a year before me, Dennis Bergkamp made a big impression in England, it was a fantastic time, I think we changed the history of the club a bit.<br /><br />This type of player was very important for Arsenal because that’s where they take you. After Alexis, Arsenal tried to sign another player like that but he was not given, so he could go back to Arsenal</p>

For me, De Ligt can play easily at any of the six best teams in the world right now. He has the power, the mentality, the heart. If I worked at another club, I would like to sign him immediately. We do not need to sell him, we do not need the money, but I know he will go to one of the big clubs<br /><br />My job is to make a top team, but we cannot keep players like Madrid or Barcelona, who can have <b>[Jasper]</b> Cillessen on the bench for four years. Players come to Ajax to be seen. Two years ago we played the final of the Europa League and rebuilt again because we lost players<br /><br /><b>[On Martin Odegaard]</b> We loved him. The salary that the boy should have earned at that time was 100,000 euros. Madrid offered 2 million. And he left. That’s why we have to be the first. There is too much money around football. There should be rules, as in American sports, for this to be fairer. Spending on signings grows and grows and will not go down. Someday it will go down and it will be like the global crisis we were experiencing recently</p>
