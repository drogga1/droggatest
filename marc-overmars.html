  <p><b>[Director of football Marc Overmars also expressed his delight at securing Ten Hag’s services for the foreseeable future]</b> We look forward to the coming years with great confidence. I think it is good for Ajax that the manager will be here in the years to come after such a successful season. We want to continue building. That will not be easy, because a few defining players will of course leave, but we hope to catch it well. Erik has to turn it into a team again. He has been entrusted with that</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal ignoring Ajax chief Marc Overmars’s transfer advice. He talks of Hakim Ziyech, who contributed 21 goals and 24 assists to the Ajax cause last season]</b> I am a bit surprised that it is still so quiet around Hakim. I think he has played better every year and his statistics are exceptionally good. Many clubs are increasingly looking at that. They look more at the numbers than at what he shows and what is happening around him. I think Hakim Ziyech is better than Mesut Ozil. I would tell Arsenal: sell him and you will get Hakim for half the price. But they didn’t listen to me. So it could just be that he stays with Ajax.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> appears to be edging towards the exits]</b> The end is in sight. It is still about bank guarantees, Ajax is always very strict about that. I hope it goes quickly now, but they will work it out. They are Italians</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax’s director of football Marc Overmars says <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a>’s transfer to Juventus is nearing its conclusion]</b> The end of the transfer of De Ligt is near. We’re awaiting bank guarantees because we are very strict with this at Ajax. Hopefully, things will progress, but I think there will be no further obstructions. They are Italians<br /><br /><b>[Mexico international <a href="edson-alvarez.html">Edson Alvarez</a> could act as De Ligt’s replacement]</b> This transfer is not depending on the development of De Ligt’s transfer. <a href="edson-alvarez.html">Edson Alvarez</a> is a player we think is good, so he might come to us. He is a good age, 21, and plays on a regular basis in the national team of Mexico and we know him very well because we scouted him over a longer period. He has progressed very well, and he can play in many positions</p>

Alvarez is a player who has a good reputation in our books. His arrival could indeed happen. I think he has the right age - 21 years old, he’s a regular starter for the Mexico national team and we know him very well because we’ve been following him for quite some time now.

I certainly won’t let him go yet, although I know that he is on lists at major European clubs. That door will remain closed for the time being<br /><br /><b>[Overmars is hopeful <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Hakim Ziyech</a> will stay put in Amsterdam and become a club legend]</b> With Hakim, I regularly think he has reached his ceiling but every season he takes another step. I sometimes tell him he can become Mr. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, so why leave? But if we’re being honest, he is 27 years old and at his peak. If he can make the step he has in mind then of course it would be allowed of us<br /><br /><b>[<a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">Donny van de Beek</a> is another player who has caught the eye]</b> Next summer I expect a lot more interest in our players. It becomes harder to keep our squad intact. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> players are loved everywhere. Think of Van de Beek and <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a>.

I am not saying that he can do everything else perfectly, but he does pick things up quickly. He is a happy boy and that is also important. On the way to the top, 50 per cent is determined by quality and the other half is a mental issue.</p>

It has already been well established that some of our players will be leaving this summer and we needed to plan for that, so it’s great that we’ve been able to finalise this transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax director Overmars slams Dutch FA over coronavirus plan]</b> The league is dead, life is more important. Why would it be about money and not people’s well-being at this time? I had hoped that the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> would take an independent decision, but they are now hiding behind UEFA<br /><br />I have a lot of difficulty understanding that. We in the Netherlands are not as dependent on television rights incomes as the leagues in Spain, England, Italy and Germany are. I think that they had been put under big pressure by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to continue playing at whatever cost<br /><br />I’m comparing the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> with the sentiments of American <a href="donald-trump.html">President Donald Trump</a> a week ago when he thought the economy was more important than the coronavirus</p>

Jan is no longer a left-back either. We have confidence in Sven Botman and Lisandro Martínez can also play there</p>
