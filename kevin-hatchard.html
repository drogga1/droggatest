<blockquote>
  <p>[How do you become a football commentator?] I did the broadcast journalism course in Nottingham Trent University. Many commentators have come out of that, including Adam Summerton [BT], Mark Scott [BBC], Phil Blacker [Sky]. If you look at the success rate of those people who came out of that course, you can see it had a beneficial effect. If you have the resources to do it, it’s definitely worthwhile.<br /><br />From my experience, a vocational course is definitely better than a theory-based course so something like a broadcast journalism course is really good. It’s not essential, but it can’t do any harm. It helped me with things like editing, being tidier and sharper with writing for broadcast, and because it did radio and TV, it shows you what is required in a newsroom. You’re also surrounded by other people who want to do it, so you see how serious you have to be to succeed.<br /><br />[How do commentators prepare for games?] I would start on a Monday [for a weekend game]. I would try watch the footage of the teams’ previous games. I also start collecting newslines and snippets that I have seen. That could range from a coach’s comment about a transfer or it might be something funny I have seen. I like the fun stuff, the silly stuff that does not appear in a stat pack or any official documentation.<br /><br />I also have a database of information and stories that I keep, so as time goes on, if I don’t use it one week, I can use it the next time I cover that particular team. Then once I get towards Thursday, I start putting stickers together with the stat pack. I do a sticker for every player in both squads. It won’t have all the same stuff on every player. It’ll have four lines of information that’s important to me. In terms of ages, I know a lot of commentators have the age of every player on every single sticker, but if a player is 26 or 27 I don’t care, if they’re 19 or 35, then it’s a story for me.<br /><br />If a player has a great record against a particular team or a player has said something inflammatory about a team that might influence the main story, then that will go in there. Or even silly stuff like if they’ve just gotten a new tattoo, that’ll go in there. I have a set of stickers for each team and then a set of statistics for each team, e.g. their defensive record, the last time they’ve won a trophy, their record against the opponents, recent form.<br /><br />As well as the stats for each of the teams, I’ll have a set of newslines for each of the teams: What the coaches said about their team, about the opposition, have any players said anything interesting recently. What I eventually distill all that down into is three or four sheets of paper and then stickers on my main book where I then can look at formations.<br /><br />If I read something or see something on TV, or even notice a Tweet that’s someone’s sent, I’ll do a note on my phone and send that to myself and then copy it into the database I have on my computer. That’s just the way I do it. All the commentators have totally different ways of doing it. I’ve never found anyone who does it exactly like me, but I’ve never found two commentators that do it exactly like each other</p>
