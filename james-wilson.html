  <p>[Manchester United striker James Wilson is gearing up for yet another loan switch after agreeing to spend the rest of the season at Sheffield United] Manchester United striker James Wilson has joined Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the remainder of the 2017/18 season. The English centre-forward came through the ranks of the Academy and famously scored twice on his first-team debut, under the interim management of Ryan Giggs against Hull City in May 2014, before going on to net two more goals during Louis van Gaal’s spell as manager. This will be Wilson’s third loan spell in the Championship, after bagging five goals in 27 appearances at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion during the 2015/16 season, prior to his spell at Derby being cut short by the aforementioned injury.</p>

  <p>[Manchester United have sent James Wilson on loan to Aberdeen] am very happy to be here. It was my coach at Manchester United Ricky Sbragia who first told me about the interest from Aberdeen, probably three or four weeks ago, but I have since heard that the club have been following my progress for a good while. They have kept an eye on me which is nice. I just felt coming to Aberdeen was the right decision to make. I have spoken to the manager on the phone. He is very positive. He told me a lot about his philosophy and plan for me going forward for the season. I chose Aberdeen because it is a massive club. Scottish football is also getting a lot of coverage, a lot of good coverage. I know a lot of the Aberdeen games are televised. All round I feel it is the right move for me. It is a new beginning for me really. A few of my loan moves have not worked out as well as I would have hoped so this one is very important. It is a big year for me. I am hoping to get as many minutes under my belt as I can and hopefully get goals to help the team push forward. Without blowing my own trumpet, I do back myself and I am a confident lad. I would like to think that this will be a good move and will be a special year. Confidence is very important for a striker. If you can keep it high then everything else will follow.</p>

  <p>[Manchester United forward James Wilson has admitted he is looking to use his loan move to Aberdeen as an opportunity to put himself in the shop window] I’ve not [spoken to Mourinho] directly but obviously he doesn’t see me in his plans for this year so the right move was to come on loan and Aberdeen was the right place. I want as many minutes as possible and as many goals as possible, but I am in my final year at Man United and I’m looking to put myself in the shop window. But obviously short term I want to help the team do well. Since I spoke to a few people about the club, they have mentioned the big names that have come here and done well and gone back to their clubs and gone stride for stride with the lads who are already in the team. It was a big factor in me coming here to develop my career. The coverage that the Scottish league is getting at the minute is really good, one in every three games is on TV. The crowds here are the same as you’d get in a Championship game, and overall I just think it was the right move.</p>
