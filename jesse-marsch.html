  <p><b>[Jesse Marsch cleared the air Friday, denying reports that he was in line to take over as manager of Red Bull Salzburg]</b> I’m the New York Red Bulls coach. This whole thing that came out, I can’t figure out how to place it, but nothing’s ever changed other than facilitating our relationship with our <b>[sister]</b> clubs over there, but I’m the New York Red Bulls coach. Period.<br /><br />Since the New Year I haven’t been in Salzburg, I’ve been in Portugal with Leipzig. There’s been no contact with Salzburg. I was there before Christmas just to spend time with both clubs and watch what’s going on there, but I’m the New York Red Bulls coach<br /><br />We decided to split our responsibilities to have them go to the combine. We’re familiar with a lot of the players already and I watched the games online and through the video, so I’m familiar with all the players in the college game right now and we felt, as a network, that it was most important for me to spend some time in Leipzig and continue to work with them and make sure that we integrate all of our clubs together in the right way<br /><br />I’ll take it as a compliment that people even think that that’s a potential avenue for me, and I’ve already said publicly that I’m an ambitious guy. Certainly the opportunity to challenge myself in leagues that are at the highest level, I think is something that interests me very much. But again, right now all my focus has been on the New York Red Bulls</p>

  <p><b>[Playoff defeats always hurt]</b> It was devastating, it was devastating to lose and fall that short with that good a group. A lot of it falls on my shoulders, so now it’s up to me to figure out how to make this team even better so that next time we get into that situation we’re more prepared and we’re ready to take it all the way. Two years ago was devastating because of how, in the end, we were so close. This past year was devastating because we didn’t get close at all with a team we thought should have been able to really make a run at it. How we came up so short at the end really made us look carefully at a lot of different things.<br /><br />The decision was clear for me. Sean Davis and Tyler Adams are ready. It was impossible not to make room for those guys to have opportunities. We know that those guys are going to make us a better team moving forward, and that’s why the decision was made. It’s cold, it does sound cold, I understand it. It’s not fair in a lot of ways, but it’s the reality of the world that we live in. It’s not an easy thing to get through because in life you have strong personal relationships, and in this business sometimes you have to put those to the side and it makes life not easy sometimes<br /><br />I actually think we’ll have a better attacking group of players than we’ve ever had since I’ve been here. That’s saying something because we’ve scored a lot of goals<br /><br />We’re trying to find ways to manage how we’re giving up big chances at times. A big emphasis this year has been on being more compact, not giving teams such opportunities to play through our press, and how we make sure that when we do press we all press together so there aren’t gaps in our team and it’s more difficult to play against us. We think that can make it harder to play through us, and we think that it means we can reward our press and counter-press more often to try and create more attacking options and expose teams when we have the ball<br /><br />We think Aaron Long is going to emerge this year as a regular starter. We think he has a very high potential. He may have some growing pains early, but he’s shown a lot with the USL team, and in the times he’s played with us in the Champions League<br /><br />Ultimately the coach is in charge so the pressure’s on me. It’s my job to figure out how to make these guys winners</p>

We looked quite good, we were brave and we were more decisive in going after the game. That part was good, so we came out after halftime and obviously we missed a penalty but still kept pushing the game. Ultimately, given everything, it’s not a terrible result - and we’ll be ready for next week.</p>

I wouldn’t be surprised if Luis is called into the next camp, I think he’s had a really good start to the year, and had a really good camp. That part of the battle was really fun to watch; even though Tim made some great saves, Luis came away with the win and the shutout.</p>

  <p><b>[On Sacha Kljestan]</b> I thought that Sacha <b>[Kljestan]</b> did a great job on that tonight, and the other guy who put such a great performance in tonight was Alex Muyl. He won like every duel, every aerial ball, every footrace, every tackle, and it set the tone for the whole team.<br /><br />Alex, he knows that his next step is more quality, more goals, more assists, more chances, and I know he has it in him because I watched him in college, and he was a goal-scorer and he was a final-play guy. I’ll be honest, I underestimated the ability he has to run and compete and push on that end.<br /><br />I know it’s only a matter of time, and sometimes with young attacking players they just need to get more into a comfort zone and more confident and then the final plays will start to come, and Alex I’d definitely put in that category, so I expect him to be much more productive from a goal-scoring and assist perspective this year<br /><br />Tyler Adams is showing some maturity and progress, which is really great to see. And now the other challenge is also now finding ways to give Sean Davis opportunities because we still believe so deeply in Sean. You know, it’s a balancing act that I’ve got to figure out how to deal with, but I think that both those guys are really going to continue to grow this year<br /><br />Right now our homegrowns aren’t just guys that we have on the roster because they’re homegrowns. They’re guys that we think have big futures at this club and potentially, who knows, beyond.<br /><br />A lot of things get talked about, a lot of different clubs, and I’m not going to talk about anywhere else, but I think right now we are at the forefront of youth development. I don’t think that anybody is building, continuing to build an academy the way that we are and continuing to invest. I think that our USL team is a clear conduit between the academy and our first team. And our USL team and our first team and our academy, we all play similar. There’s a similar style, and I think that we’re showing as a first team that we invested in homegrown players, we invest in young players, and we invest in youth development.<br /><br />So I think that now when people start to talk about all the different clubs, I can’t believe that Red Bulls are not considered one of the top, if not the top, because just by pure numbers and performance and Matt Miazga going to Chelsea and everything else, people need to start to pay attention that there’s a real effort here to try to invest in young talent, and that it’s going to continue to pay dividends for us down the road</p>

So all these six-pointers are valuable and important. We’ll have another one next weekend.<br /><br />At this point in the year, it’s about making progress and growing so that you continue to understand what it’s going to take within the year to be the team you want to become. That’s where I look at, regardless of the result, and feel pretty good about the night</p>

It’s a day for the fans to appreciate Dax, for Dax to appreciate the fans. For Dax to get to see the people that meant a lot to him.</p>

I think it was also a good game for us, a good game for them, a good game for the league. There’s a lot of attention paid to it. That’s the way it should be. And then Dax makes a big play for them, too.<br /><br />What’s most important for us, specifically, is that we have such a strong belief in the team that we have here and the group that we have here and how we do things and what we’re building. I think that we’ve already in this short season learned so much about ourselves and continue to get better. and now have to put it to the test in this week because it’s going to be a very hard week, and we’ll find out more about ourselves in the next week</p>

That’s plain and simple.<br /><br /><b>[Rather than assign blame, Marsch put Sunday’s performance on one person]</b> I have to take responsibility for this, because to have a team that’s not ready to play from the start, and to play a first half like that where we show no life and no commitment and no belief, I have to look carefully at what I’m doing. And, you know, there’s not enough guys that are playing up to their potential and their capabilities, and so again, that has to fall on my shoulders<br /><br />Time for us to learn about ourselves.

  <p><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> This would go back to when he was 15 when I first met him. You could tell he was different. It wasn’t just that he was athletic and was a good player. It was that he believed he was going to be a good player. That maturity and that self-belief that he has lends itself towards him continuing to grow in a big way.<br /><br />Michael Bradley was always very locked in to his process. At a young age, he was very mature, but they have a different kind of intensity. Michael’s intensity is very, I think, inner-focused and over the years he’s had to teach himself to expand outside of himself. Tyler has a real ease to his inner focus, his ability to integrate within a group, his appreciation for people around him. He’s social. He’s a balanced young man. I think that will help him integrate and adapt to whatever situation he’s in<br /><br />Our goal is to play him more in the middle of the midfield this year, but I still think there will be times when we do use him out wide. We’ll just have to look at each week and realize where we’re at and figure out how to get the best out of our team in that particular week. Tyler is the type of person and player that grows each day and each week. I expect that, a year from now, we’ll be talking about a very different player than we are right now</p>

He’s not intimidated. He’s ready for this challenge.<br /><br />I remember seeing Ben Mines play - in 2016 was the first time that I watched him - and I think that he was on the U15 team then. He would play out on the right wing and he was so aggressive and when he got the ball, he was so aggressive to go at guys and make plays. And, you know, you could see that he was still trying to figure out the defensive responsibility part, but you could see how gifted he was just with the ball on the move</p>

It is a group of people that are all committed to each other and that’s from Marc de Grandpre and the organization to Denis Hamlett and the way that we run the sporting department. And then when we talk about how our first team, our USL team, our PDL team and our academy teams work together, there’s a system here. It’s a factory. It’s a player and a football factory, and we believe wholeheartedly there’s no one in this club who doesn’t believe in the way we do things, and our identity, and it actually makes life easy for everyone</p>

So, there’s more than just him but certainly he was a catalyst in that sense.<br /><br />It’s taken time to groom. He still has a ways to go yet. It’s not like he’s a finished product. But, that was the thing that anyone, when they recall the first time they met Tyler, they referenced that. Whether he was 13, or 15, now 19, that he’s a man. For whatever reason he’s this old soul and he’s figured out how to manage this world. It’s going to continue to reward him. He’s only getting better. I think we sometimes see, every day, the growth before our eyes. We see how every day he gets better and every day he’s more confident and he has more belief and he has a better ability to lead and communicate with people around him. It’s just growing.

  <p><b>[Bradley Wright-Phillips has made goals look easy to come by during his time in Major League Soccer]</b> There is this perception that Brad’s not one of the premier players in this league. Brad got a couple of shots in on him early in the game and I was saying to the fourth official if that’s David VIlla, he gets the call. Why doesn’t Bradley Wright-Phillips garner the respect of the premier players in this league? Because you could make an argument that he is the best player to ever play in this league, and the best goal-scorer to play in this league, and he should be treated as such by everyone, including referees. If we’re talking about protecting the star players, and making sure that we’re protecting attacking players<br /><br />The win today was amazing. We bounced back well from <b>[Real Salt Lake]</b>. It was what we needed, and the boys reacted well<br /><br />I’ve made this argument for four years with Brad, that he doesn’t get the respect that he deserves. But I don’t think he gives a damn. He’s just going to go out and do his thing and show every day what he’s about. He’s incredible. He’s incredible. He should be the most underrated player in league history.

So, although it winds up being a loss on the scoreboard and the result doesn’t go our way - and listen, I’m judged by results ultimately - but this team has something. There’s something to this group. As disappointing as it is to be right on the doorstep of a big moment for the club, I’m so optimistic with this group.</p>

  <p><b>[Roller-coaster week ends on a high for Red Bulls playmaker Kaku]</b> This was Kaku’s best game by a mile. He’s worked hard to try to understand tactically what we’re trying to get out of him. He’s worked hard to understand now what the reactions are, where he’s needed, what kind of final plays. Even on Thursday, we used to kind of put him in situations where he could make more final plays in training and I think it created clarity for him<br /><br />In these high-level games, for us the tactics are often the most important thing. And in some ways, I didn’t think it would be fair to Kaku or the team to put him in situations where he might not be ready for it. Now, when you see tonight, of course, everyone is going to say: ‘Well, he should have played on Tuesday’. That game was a very different game. Very different game. It was a game about them locking in on us, not having any space, about mobility, about movement up top. And it’s not to say that Kaku couldn’t have fit in there and that we couldn’t have helped him do certain things. But we made that decision based on what we thought that game would require, and if he came in late, there might be more space and he might be able to make some plays and he almost did<br /><br />One of the things we’ve talked to him about is not feeling like he just has to make plays. That the most important thing about being here is just integrating into what we do. Once he figures out the system, the rest will come with ease because he has those gifts<br /><br />Is it time to take the handcuffs off? The answer is yes. Now it’s time to let him go and understand and allow him to really fit into the group, and today I think he showed everyone, including himself, that he’s going to be a really good fit here and he’s going to be a big player here</p>

But I think as time has gone on and we’ve both now been able to process what the rivalry means to us and to our clubs, I think we’ve both been able to focus more on the tactics and the ability for our players and our team to execute on the day than it has been about the emotion of anything between him and I. And then I think in that process we’ve been able to clearly look at the other team and go, ‘you know what, they’re good’. ‘They’re good at what they do. There’s things to learn from what they do.’ And you have to respect the fact that he knows that we have a way, and I know that they have a way. And when you look at coaches, and you’re trying to pick up on qualities that you can learn from, that’s the first thing I always look for. Do they have a style, do they have a way? How do they execute it? Do they look the same team day in and day out? And for sure, when you look at New York City for the past three years you can categorically say that that’s the case.<br /><br /><b>[Marsch had similarly high praise for Vieira]</b> We’re <b>[from]</b> very different backgrounds. Patrick comes from the best clubs in the world, and has been around some of the best managers and developed himself to be a great manager in his own right, and I think <b>[he]</b> has an incredible future in Europe and in big clubs. For me, I was a young American who grew up here and tried to figure out a way to take myself from being a player to being a good coach. And I’ve been lucky to have great mentors, and I landed at a great club here at New York Red Bulls and now I’ve been tasked with trying to figure out a way to make this style of play, and this club, and this philosophy the best that it can be for this setting in our league. Frankly it’s a big compliment to even be considered a coaching match-up with a guy like Patrick Vieira. I think that we’ve tried to, in our way, challenge the things that they’re good at every time we play them. That’s not necessarily that different than anyone we play against, but we know that New York City is really good at the things that they’re good at<br /><br />It’s a rival, maybe it’s too complimentary right now because there still should be a lot of emotion. We’re going to be ready on Saturday to give our best. We’re going to be ready to go after the game. We’re going to be ready to throw a lot at it, and we’re going to be ready for them to throw a lot at us. It’ll be fun, but it’ll be hard and it’ll be real</p>

  <p><b>[The Hudson River Derby]</b> I think New York City probably has the best team they’ve had yet, and I think we have a good team too. We’re still establishing ourselves in the season, and trying to find ways to get better, but yeah, it has potential to be a really good matchup between two really good teams.<br /><br />I think actually, and I don’t mean this to be self-serving in any way, but they look more like a Red Bull team than a possession team than they used to. They counter-press a lot more. They move their backline a lot more. They look to, I think, be better against the ball, where in the past they’ve had much more emphasis on movement and ideas with the ball. They’ve always been real interesting to watch, but this year I think it’s becoming a little bit more similar to the things that we really like. I admire his ability to teach a team how to be good with the ball and really manage games that way. I think we’re trying to become a little bit more like them, and I think they’re trying to become a little bit more like us<br /><br />What does this rivalry usually come down to? Is it David Villa’s day, or is it Bradley Wright-Phillips day. Obviously that midfield trio for each team can help feed to the success of that striker on the day, but these two players, in many ways, have defined this series and I think that will come down to it in many ways again</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls dominate midfield battle in Hudson River Derby demolition]</b> We designed a specific tactical pressuring scheme to try to limit <b>[Villa and Moralez]</b>. That being said, you know, with Moralez, he’s very nifty and he’s very clever at finding little pockets.<br /><br />So it was sometimes going to be Tyler around him, but it was also going to require whoever was in the vicinity to be aware of where he was and to close down his space. And then I think you saw a tough day for David Villa based on the performances of Tim Parker and Aaron Long. If we can continue to get really good defensive performances and continue to tactically be on top of games, then the potential for this team is good<br /><br />I think we won the battle of the midfield. I think we picked up more second balls. I think we pressed them better. We picked them off in possession more, and Tyler covered a ton of ground and he made a bunch of plays to break them up to make it hard on Moralez. Even when he didn’t take the ball from Moralez, he made him alter everything he did and often play backwards. The more that you can now put him in situations where he’s got to find ways to wiggle out of and not be in open space, then it’s obviously much more difficult for him<br /><br />Tyler, I thought, a really good day. Sean Davis, really good day. Kaku, obviously, very good day, and <b>[Valot]</b>, very good day, too. We like our midfield. We like our ability to run. We like our ability to think, to understand the tactics. So yeah, it’s a good group</p>

He was big, he was fast, he was good on the ball, he was good in the air, so I thought why not take a look at him. We asked him if he would be willing to come here if it meant spending a year with Red Bulls II, learning our system.<br /><br /><b>[Long said of his decision to join the Red Bulls]</b> I gave myself a timeline. If it doesn’t work, if I go to Red Bulls and it doesn’t work for two years then I have to do something else, but I was still in the mindset of making it<br /><br />He’s funny, he’s likeable, his work ethic is so strong. He’s not afraid. When you work with him up close, Dave Sarachan learned this and I think Gregg (Berhalter) has too, you can’t help but like him. You can’t help but like the way he works every day, the way that he trains, the way that he treats his teammates.

I still believe that his max potential is when he plays our way, when he plays really strong against the ball, when he uses his athleticism. What it shows with the national team is this kid can play in a lot of different ways, and at a lot of different levels, and I do believe he can thrive in Europe<br /><br />We had this conversation with Dave Sarachan, we even had this discussion with <a href="gregg-berhalter.html">Gregg Berhalter</a>, when they watch him at first they don’t really rate (Long).

Having said that, I think this in every way will be mission impossible! Who cares? Honestly, who cares? As long as we go there and play brave then we can walk out of there and be very proud. We will be smart, but our way to play defensive is to make sure we understand how to be aggressive in certain areas and we still play our version of football and calculate exactly how we want this game to be played</p>

It requires luck, being in the right situation, being surrounded by the right people. Staying healthy. I talked often about Erling having a father that played football and that’s a big advantage for him, his father and him understand how to navigate this world. They made a really good decision coming to Salzburg. They could’ve gone to a lot of bigger clubs at 18. They saw that Erling needed one more step in his career, to continue to improve and make mistakes and find the right development path. For me Leipzig is a great club for any player, especially a young player and especially an explosive player who’s good in transition so in theory it’s a great fit for Erling. The people at the club are really, really good people and focused a lot on development of players, on taking care of players, on professionalism. The standard for the quality of a club at Leipzig is so high.<br /><br />Erling is a special player for us. He’s a goalscorer. He’s aggressive around the goal. His overall mindset fits our club and our philosophy perfectly. It’s great. He’s young, he’s explosive, he’s dynamic and he’s fearless. At 19 years old he has massive potential. I’ve been around other young players, including at Leipzig, that at 19 years old have major potential as well. The key for Erling is not what is his potential but the drive to achieve the potential and he has that. He has the personality that’s never satisfied. He’s always thinking about improvement. He’s already a top professional in terms of how he takes care of himself and how he prepares off the field every day</p>

How can I use this platform to unite U.S. Soccer, club soccer, academies, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, youth national teams, men, women, everything combined? Because the only chance we have to really tap into our potential is if everybody believes in a common purpose and everybody works together</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg head coach Jesse Marsch reiterated his belief in the high-press]</b> I’d much rather go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and lose that match 4-3 than sit back for 90 minutes and maybe try to catch them on the counter. I just enjoy this way of living. And I also believe it breeds success. We went through this with New York. When I inherited the New York team it was a very passive team, they would sit a little bit deeper and then they would give the ball to <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> and they would catch you on the counter. I had to change the whole mentality of how we thought about things and how we played<br /><br /><b>[Marsch’s Red Bulls developed a style that allowed them to shine in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, highlighted by that pressing mindset]</b> It became infectious. It was so fun over the years to sit with Dax, Sacha, BWP, <a href="luis-robles.html">Luis Robles</a>, these guys who were older and played a certain style who basically we had transformed the way they thought about football. We would be watching a Champions League game and they would be going crazy because the other team would be sitting back and allowing <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to have 5,000 passes and they would be going like ‘press them, press them<br /><br />It’s the right way, baby. When I worked with <b>[former RBNY GM]</b> <a href="ali-curtis.html">Ali Curtis</a>, when we first came to Red Bull together, he coined a phrase, ‘If you want something in life, you don’t wait for it, you go out and get it.’ And that was the way we described our style of play. I call it going down swinging</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg coach Jesse Marsch says <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Takumi Minamino</a> made it clear that he wanted to leave the club in January]</b> Taki made it clear at the beginning of the talks in November that he would like to leave in winter. He wanted to make sure that he behaved best in the rest of his time in Salzburg. We helped him think carefully about his next step. It was clear to us: He will leave us. In the end, he went to the reigning Champions League winners, a deal that means a lot to the entire club and is a great honour<br /><br />Erling was uncertain what to do and when. He knew that his role in Salzburg was special. Red Bull Salzburg was intrinsically important for his development. There were significantly more discussions with Erling. Being younger than Taki made it all the more important to deal with the situation properly. It took more work so that he didn’t lose focus. In the end it is difficult not to understand his decision. The experiences we had with him and his father were wonderful and we will not forget them. We are proud of Erling and its success</p>

  <p><b>[Former boss Marsch backing Reds new boy]</b> When I came <b>[to the club]</b>, I knew he was going to be a big part of what we were about. He’s smart, very clever. He’s not pure explosive but he understands football, he understands how to make final plays and tactics.<br /><br />What you have in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is so many talented and experienced players that play ahead of him, so it might take a while for Taki to establish himself in that group.<br /><br />I think over time, they’re going to figure out more and more and more that he can play almost any of the front six positions for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Because he’s so smart and clever, he’ll figure things out and get better as he goes.<br /><br />I’ve heard that in training he’s done really well and they’ve been really impressed, but in games it just hasn’t come together for him. It might take a little bit of time, but knowing Taki he’s a guy who has so much drive and will find a way to get better every day. It’ll only be a matter of time</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg boss Jesse Marsch says <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> can become one of the best in the world]</b> First, his physical qualities, his speed, his power, he can get to top speed from like one step, his size, all of these things for me put him right away in the upper echelon of players. He’s got the potential to be one of the best players in the world. What makes Erling so special is his mentality. To start with, he was in the youth World Cup, he scored nine goals in one game. We gave every one of our players who had international obligations three weeks off before they were supposed to come with us. Erling had six days off and then said ‘no, I want to come to camp’. Erling came to Salzburg last winter, he played one game in spring, so he had a lot of sitting on the bench. He was so keen to start proving himself, right away I knew this kid had ambition and grind. In the first training sessions, you could see his competitiveness. He was often the first guy at training and the last one to leave. There were days when I had to tell him to go home and rest. He’s fearless, he’s competitive, he’s got a drive to get better, he’s equipped with so many qualities that make him very different and special, along with the ability and pure talent, he’ll be fun to watch in the coming years, that’s for sure</p>

I think he could be good in <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>’s position where against the ball, he is ready to do some pressing, but then with the ball, he comes into almost a 10 position for build-up and gets in the box to score goals. <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is so good at it but I think that’s something Taki can do as well.

  <p><b>[Marsch admits viral video of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> half-time team talk made him ‘uncomfortable’]</b> I wouldn’t say I was happy - when all of these documentary videos come out, they can be uncomfortable. I hate watching myself speak German, it’s painful! But I went through this in the U.S. - people love this content now. I watched The Last Dance with Michael Jordan as soon as it would come out and I could not wait to watch the next episodes - real life is the most interesting story. We had an interesting story to tell this year with our club and the Champions League - it had been so many years that we had been fighting to get there and we finally achieved that goal. People wanted to see our story and in the end, the half-time video, the only thing I always say about content inside of a team is you have to make sure it represents not just one individual, but it represents the whole group. In that moment, I felt that the focus was a little too much on the coach and not so much on the full team.<br /><br />In the end, regardless of what was said at half-time, the team and the coaching staff, we all managed to be better in the second half together - that’s what is important. The players are young and they haven’t been doing this as long so maybe it’s a dream to play in the Champions League against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but my focus was preparing our team. That was a big part of the message and why I handled half-time the way I did - because I knew that we could be so much better</p>

But then when you also consider his tactical intelligence, his motivation, his discipline, his desire to improve and grow, then the combination means you have something very unique. We are only scratching the surface of the potential for Erling. He will continue to do well at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and I’m not sure how long he’ll be there before it’s time for him to take the next step, but he has the potential to be one of the best players in the world, no doubt. It’s another player that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be very lucky to have. It won’t be cheap, but he loves the explosive style of play and being in open spaces, running in behind defences and being aggressive. Just by theory, it fits the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> plays. He would be an incredible fit</p>

Just from a mentality perspective, he’s one of the most aggressive, cut-throat, attacking players I have ever seen. If a defender stops him going one way, that doesn’t faze him at all - he wants the ball again and he’s attacking - again and again and again. For <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he could play in any of the front three positions and he would be fantastic. From a footballing mind, from an explosive perspective, from a finishing perspective, from a mentality perspective, he is an incredible player and has the potential to get even better. It won’t be cheap for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but that would be a great asset, that is for sure.<br /><br />He can <b>[play all across the front line]</b> because he is intelligent but he likes drifting to the left side and then be ready to run in behind the opponent or get balls on the run and come in on his right foot. But he can do this on the right, on the left, he is so smart at finding space and timing his runs. His pace is incredible and then his finishing at speed <b>[…]</b> From an attacking perspective, he has very few, if any, weaknesses, and then he even has an ability to work for the team. And he is fit all of the time. He is almost never injured, which is a big asset for an explosive attacking player to have as well</p>
