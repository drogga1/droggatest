  <p><b>[Mislintat had been the driving force behind Kagawa’s move to BVB, revealing how he had extensively monitored the attacking midfielder through repeated visits to the Far East]</b> We were in Japan six times, did 10 to 15 pieces of video analysis just from that player. And once we completed our job, we were convinced that he’s a player we can use, especially for this price.<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel also did not like how involved Mislintat was on a day-to-day basis with the players at the club and had him banned from their training ground in Brackel]</b> I would probably never have come up with the idea of ​​engaging with other clubs and offers, if not for what had just happened. The ban initiated by the former coach to enter the training grounds and the clear instruction to keep me away from the inner circle of players and the staff, including many friends with whom I have worked closely for years, has had a decisive impact on my thinking</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal transfer chief salutes special Ousmane Dembele amid talk of January bid]</b> I saw him, he had not even played for Stade Rennes in the first team. I bet he did not know which foot he used in certain situations because he just did not think about it. I felt this is a really special player. Shinji Kagawa was one of those. We were in Japan 10 times, but actually I was safe after the first 30 minutes of play. Nobody could grab it. With one move, he changed the entire direction of the game.<br /><br />The change was made by the signatures of the club officials, not by a strike. As a club, we must channel the strengths and weaknesses of our players and stop complaining. Ousmane did not come to training - right. But this ability to develop strategies to exploit every gap was worth gold on the field. Ousmane decided to play games for us and was significantly responsible for the 2017 cup victory. Many of these top players who make the difference come from different environments, where they became hungry for promotion and success. They have a special intrinsic motivation</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi signing showed the old Arsenal are back]</b> saw him (Guendouzi) play in Lorient when the club was still in Ligue 1. I like this club, you always find interesting players there. Guendouzi attracted attention with his long hair and his personality but my interest is also the weakness of a player. Can you stop them? Matteo ran inexpedient over the whole field but for me one thing was clear: It’s just a matter of time to break with that habit. For us, the transfer of this 18-year-old boy was an important signal to show the world: We are the old Arsenal again, who give young players a real chance.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven Mislintat has offered an alarming assessment of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s recruitment strategy, with the transfer specialist revealing that broken promises and a change in direction led him away from the club]</b> Last summer there were leadership changes at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It had actually been agreed that I would become technical director, so then I would be around the team on a daily basis. But the new leadership had their own agenda and other candidates. On top of that, we had different approaches. Previously we had a strong systematic approach to transfers, a mixture of watching things live as well as quality data and video analysis. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> actually owns their own data company. That meant that we acted independently, we knew about all markets and players in all positions that came into question. However, the new leadership work more strongly with what they are offered from clubs or agents through their own networks</p>

  <p><b>[Sven Mislintat says <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> has been billed as the absolute team player]</b> He is one, possibly the only one, of these extraordinary top, top, top strikers who is an absolute team player. A striker like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, for example, would never give a penalty to Pepe to score his first goal. It’s vice versa - ‘Come on, I will take this penalty kick, nobody else!’ <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> gave the chance to Pepe. His instinct was, ‘Let’s score and let’s go forward together’. He takes care about his team-mates.<br /><br />Since he joined <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, he played where he was asked and needed, and so he helped especially <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> to adapt to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Maybe this attitude costs him to play for clubs like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> but maybe they made a mistake not to go for him. I like his mindset. It is good for a team’s atmosphere<br /><br /><b>[Mislintat added on <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s decision to swap <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> It was clear <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> had to make the next move in his career. There were some rumours he was going to go to China. I thought that was too early a move for him. I knew <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> well and knew he wanted to play for a big side in England or Spain. When I started talking to him, it was obvious it was not about money; it was about a new challenge, to play in the biggest and most competitive league to compete with the best players. And it was about reaching the next level. Today, he is one of a few players who were able to score a substantial number of goals in at least three of the big five leagues</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> head of recruitment Sven Mislintat on <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>]</b> In the dressing room, he is not arrogant or extroverted. For me, without any doubt, he is one of the best professionals I ever worked with. He is a hard worker, a great athlete. He is always smiling. He is a quiet leader but he really is a leader<br /><br /><a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> is funny. There is sunshine if he is around</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> scout Sven Mislintat has backed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s out-of-sorts winger <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a>, as the Frenchman struggles to make an impression at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>]</b> Ousmane, like I have said many times before, is in a sense, a bandit. If you understand him and support him, he can help you win games on his own. That helped <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to be successful, but it also means that if he wants to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, he will do everything to make it happen. And talented players who may have a slightly tricky character barely have a chance to make it to the top, but often these players are real winners<br /><br /><b>[An experienced operator in the transfer market, he believes the way clubs present themselves in negotiations is skewed, and leads to inaccurate views of players]</b> I find it very unfair that this transfer, which brought sporting success with Ousmane’s big contributions to the cup victory and financial success with a three-digit million profit for the club, is discussed only negatively. Clubs need to stop talking about the bad player and the good club. We as clubs are fighting hard with each other and with players. It’s about winning: the negotiation, the money, the best players to win more games and achieve your goals</p>
