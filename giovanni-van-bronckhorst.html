  <p><b>[<a href="guido-albers.html">Guido Albers</a> says his client Giovanni van Bronckhorst is interested in succeeding <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a> at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> I think the rumours have come a little bit early and no-one from the club has spoken to Gio. But I think every coach in the world would be interested in working in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And what we would say if a club like <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> has an opportunity to work for them then of course he would be interested in doing that. It is an amazing club with an amazing fanbase but it’s up to them who they decide to go for. Giovanni left Feyenoord, he was competing on a limited budget but won the Eredivisie against two clubs in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> who have greater resources. He had a great relationship with the fans, the players, the media and the city and he’s ready for the next challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Rangers star Giovanni van Bronckhorst hopes to one day come into contention for prestigious coaching posts at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> and Ibrox]</b> At the moment I’m enjoying my work in China. But as a player I had ambition and as a coach I have ambition. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> for me is the number one league in the world to be working at and, for me, it is definitely an ambition to work in. I always said if I could coach the teams I played for it would be a big dream<br /><br />I can only look with pride and a smile on my face on my wonderful years at Rangers. The gap between Rangers and <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> is getting closer and hopefully <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> will make Rangers champions again. He’s doing a really good job. I can see similarities between Steven and me, it’s a different task to being a player but we’re both enjoying it. I also enjoyed being part of a special team at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but unfortunately I had a big injury. But I look back on it as a great experience<br /><br />Last year I spent five months with the City group and a lot of time in Manchester with Pep. He was very open. He talked about the training sessions and I could watch and see everything and talk with his staff. Those are moments you can see him really in action and he is a very special coach. Those months with him in Manchester I could see a lot of things I didn’t see before and it helped to develop me as a coach. Pep is a coach at the moment who is influencing a lot of young coaches. And he’s not the only one, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is doing a great job at Liverpool</p>
