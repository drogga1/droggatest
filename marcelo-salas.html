  <p><b>[Marcelo Salas says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Can Catch Inter]</b> This visit was not scheduled, but I wanted to say ‘hi’ to the lads. Some of my former team-mates are still playing and it was nice to see them again. I spent some wonderful years here and I will come back to watch <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> - Inter. After the match with Chievo it will be difficult for the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a>, but there are still a few games before the end of the season and I think they can still trouble the Nerazzurri</p>

  <p><b>[Marcelo Salas says <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> is perfect for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> In modern football it is important to have an element like him who can play in more than one role. He was a great swoop. He’s a very useful player, blessed with dynamism and good technique. Arturo is the ideal midfield partner for <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a>. They will be perfect, a complete and well assembled partnership. One will steal the ball with the right level of sporting aggression, while the other can dictate play</p>
