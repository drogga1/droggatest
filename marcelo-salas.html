  <p><b>[<a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> Salas says <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> is perfect for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> In modern football it is important to have an element like him who can play in more than one role. He was a great swoop. He’s a very useful player, blessed with dynamism and good technique. Arturo is the ideal midfield partner for <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a>. They will be perfect, a complete and well assembled partnership. One will steal the ball with the right level of sporting aggression, while the other can dictate play</p>
