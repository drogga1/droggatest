  <p><b>[Cindy Cone call out <a href="carlos-cordeiro.html">Cordeiro</a> after controversial USWNT court filing]</b> I am hurt and saddened by the brief USSF filed. This issue means so much to me, but more broadly to all men &amp; women and, more importantly, to little girls &amp; boys who are our future. I disavow the troubling statements and will continue to work to forge a better path forward</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. Soccer confirmed on Monday that the federation has hired William Wilson as its new chief executive officer]</b> We are thrilled Will is joining U.S. Soccer as our CEO. He brings an unrivaled set of experience and expertise to soccer in America. His global perspective, background in marketing and growing sporting events and extensive experience in the sports business will be invaluable in growing soccer at all levels. Soccer is the world’s game and Will is the perfect person to help us grow it to America’s game</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT trial pushed back to June due to coronavirus pandemic]</b> I don’t think a trial is good for either party or for soccer both in this country or internationally. Our women’s team is the best team in the world. I am hopeful we can find a resolution before this goes to trial<br /><br />We are hopeful we can schedule <b>[talks]</b> very soon. I think it’s challenging right now with the backdrop of coronavirus. I’m a big believer in getting people in the same room and finding resolutions. In the meantime, we may have to settle with jumping on phone calls. I’m hopeful this will be the case in the coming weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Cindy Parlow Cone on Policy 604-1]</b> I want to again personally apologize to all black people, as well as other minorities, for us not being leaders in this fight. I want to affirm that your experiences in our country are real, that I hear you, that I see you and that I believe in you. Repealing Policy 604-1 was just the first step. We will continue to engage with our players, our staff and soccer stakeholders to help us be a positive force for change going forward</p>
