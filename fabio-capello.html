  <p><b>[Fabio Capello on why England underperform at major tournaments]</b> Because they’re tired. They’re the least fresh of any of the competing national sides, because their league doesn’t have a break. It’s like when you’re driving a car: if you stop halfway to put fuel in then you’ll definitely get where you want to go, but if you don’t then there’s always the chance you’ll be running on empty before you reach your goal. In my opinion, the football played in the first half of the English season is much better than in the second half. And because of that, if you want to be a competitive team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you need a really big squad, which is a luxury you don’t get with the national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Capello believes <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> can succeed if deployed the right way by Conte]</b> Italian football is not very fast but <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> has never been very fast in his career. I think he can do well as a director, like <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a> at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and not as a winger. He does not have the speed to be a box-to-box player. I think he can be a player like <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Brozovic</a> and not a player like <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a>. He is not a man who does a lot dribbling</p>

They are the future, they can make history later.’ And the only one of them who did little was Gago, while the other two did their part. They needed experience and character. You have to sign young people and then use them little by little, taking care of them. You cannot give them the responsibility now</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Capello says he gave the England players a choice between <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> or ‘Calamity’ <a href="david-james.html">David James</a> when it came to replacing <a href="robert-green.html">Rob Green</a> in goal at the 2010 World Cup]</b> You can’t say anything. Everyone makes mistakes. He made one, so I changed. I put in Calamity James. I had Green and I had <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a>, just a kid. I asked the players. <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a> or Calamity? ‘Calamity.’ I put Calamity in because of the players’ trust. <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and the defenders had more faith in James. <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a> had played only once<br /><br />Everyone saw it. Besides, because of the effect on the ball, when it hits the bar, the floor - the pitch was dry - and goes up like that, it can only have gone in: it’s physics. There had been a conference in Salt Lake City in February: an hour about the ball, 45 minutes about referees. The preparation was perfect, they said. This, that, the other. And I said to the referees’ chief: ‘Why not put someone behind the goal, a fifth official?’ ‘No, we’ve decided this way<br /><br />Look! I said this would happen. We worked for two years and because of someone else’s mistake we’re going home. Because you didn’t put someone there. What’s he sitting in the stands for? Put him behind the goal. It was there! I told them that in February</p>

  <p><b>[Former England, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> manager Fabio Capello has encouraged footballers to actively support their local communities]</b> There has been a big debate in many countries about whether footballers should agree to take pay cuts at this time. I am not sure about pay cuts, as that involves the clubs, but I do believe that top professional footballers, who earn so much money today, should realise how lucky they are and give support to people in their local communities at this terrible time. This isn’t just about money; it’s about giving time, the benefit of their status and celebrity and being active members of society<br /><br /><b>[Capello, meanwhile, also pointed to specific ways players could help, using the examples of fellow Laureus Academy members <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Alessandro Del Piero</a> and Ryan Giggs]</b> <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a> is raising funds for the Italian Red Cross and is planning to bring together the 2006 Italy World Cup winning team to play in a fundraiser. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, the manager of Wales, has offered rooms in hotels he owns in Manchester for use by health workers. These are very good and imaginative examples of how football individuals and teams can do good and show that sport cares. It is the local communities which keep football teams alive and pay television subscriptions which have made the sport so profitable and the players so wealthy. What is so frustrating is that we cannot see this enemy. It is there, it is attacking us, but we can only fight back in an indirect way.</p>

  <p><b>[How Ibrahimovic was transformed by Capello at Juventus]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> came from <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and he was just playing for fun, scoring was an optional for him. With the potential he had, he had to look for the net more and stop performing like it was a circus. I had to make him understand this thing to make him that great player he is, because he still proves it at the age of 38. It’s all been down to him: I only gave him suggestions and he put into practice<br /><br /><b>[Capello admits that he has not always had so much success helping players attain the peaks that their potential]</b> <a href="antonio-cassano.html">Antonio Cassano</a> is my biggest regret. I couldn’t make him the great player he could have been. I worked so hard but I didn’t do it. I heard from him a few days ago. His wife has since put him in line.

  <p><b>[Lautaro Martinez urged to stay at Inter by Capello]</b> If I were him, I would stay at Inter, because at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> he would be a substitute.<br /><br />It seems to me that, economically, in Spain the only team that will not be destroyed in this pandemic is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> are going to suffer a lot.
