  <p><b>[Fabio Capello on why England underperform at major tournaments]</b> Because they’re tired. They’re the least fresh of any of the competing national sides, because their league doesn’t have a break. It’s like when you’re driving a car: if you stop halfway to put fuel in then you’ll definitely get where you want to go, but if you don’t then there’s always the chance you’ll be running on empty before you reach your goal. In my opinion, the football played in the first half of the English season is much better than in the second half. And because of that, if you want to be a competitive team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you need a really big squad, which is a luxury you don’t get with the national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have never properly replaced Xavi despite boasting some of the world’s finest forwards]</b> The problem for Luis Enrique is the centre of the park. He has an incredible attack, but in midfield he doesn’t have Xavi - who has never been properly replaced - and Iniesta has suffered injuries. On the other hand, Real Madrid have made very good signings and above all picked the time to do it well, while Barcelona haven’t reinforced their squad as they may have liked to.<br /><br /><b>[On Barca’s MSN attacking unit]</b> The three are excellent in terms of quality and creativity, but above all they provide the perfect mix of attributes. <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez is the centre forward that Barcelona had been looking for for a while, Neymar has improved a lot and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi is the same phenomenon as always.

Sergio Ramos is difficult to mark on corners, because he moves based on the various blocks, while Cristiano Ronaldo has to be watched before the ball. He always anticipates the movement when scoring a goal. Keylor Navas has grown so much as a goalkeeper recently and often rescued the result for Real Madrid this season. He plays almost as a sweeper and can see in advance what is going to happen.<br /><br />Real have a better midfield, but Juventus’ defence is superior. The attacks are both at a high level.<br /><br /><b>[Capello coached both Real and Juventus]</b> I am cheering on Juventus tonight.

I asked him how much he weighed when he won the World Cup and he said 84kg, so I asked him to at least get to 88. It was a shame, he didn’t want to make the smallest sacrifice and the best he managed was 94kg. He played three games in partnership with Ruud van Nistelrooy and we lost all three.</p>

I’d say Juventus got themselves a fantastic deal by selling him at that price.<br /><br /><b>[On Paulo Dybala]</b> Dybala is still a long way off <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He has to improve his consistency and the way he participates in the overall moves.

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid head coach Fabio Capello thinks his former club are paying the price for thinking they could achieve the same level of success without Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Maybe Madrid <b>[are worse]</b>, they are paying the price for thinking that they could get results without Cristiano Ronaldo.

I’m not too worried about the most recent defeat, but more about what they’re doing well and doing badly. We know they’re not defending well in their area, but they do have Courtois who gives them security<br /><br />Attention to Los Blancos’ great quality, but the Giallorossi are better physically and Di Francesco is more flexible.

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney had lost everything prior to making to a move to MLS]</b> Rooney is a good player, but I saw the season when he returned to Everton and he didn’t perform well. He was on the pitch like a different person. He was not with the team. It was not the Rooney I remember - fighting, running - nothing. He lost everything, all his characteristics. He decided to go to America. The football is different, it’s a new experience and a lot of Italian players go there at the end of their careers.</p>
