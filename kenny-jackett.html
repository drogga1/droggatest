  <p><b>[Portsmouth and Oxford played out a 1-1 draw to leave their League One play-off semi-final on a knife edge]</b> We did get very good deliveries in today and when we got the ball into certain players, we got into good areas. To be fair to them, they defended their box very well and got the blocks in. I do think, in terms of shots, we will come out on top but we can do better on Monday. Certain things are rusty but there was a real heart and spirit about our side today that I really liked</p>

  <p><b>[Oxford secured their place in the League One play-off final after a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Portsmouth on Monday night]</b> I’m obviously very disappointed. We got our noses in front twice in the two matches and we’ve given away two sloppy goals. We’ve been able to take control by scoring the vital first goal but we’ve not been able to capitalise on it<br /><br />With their goal, though I haven’t seen replays of it yet, apparently it’s just gone over (the line) - those are the small margins you are talking about. But I’ve got no qualms about goalline technology unusually being used in these semi-finals. We both knew these were the rules<br /><br />We’ve been in the play-offs two years in a row now. We need to dust ourselves down, raise our standards and try to go one better next season and go up. And when training starts again we’ve got to make sure there is no hangover from this</p>
