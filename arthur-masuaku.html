  <p><b>[West Ham United defender Arthur Masuaku has praised <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> as the first manager to have aided his development in England]</b> Since I joined the club, he is the first manager who I felt has helped me improve. He believes in me a lot. He always says to me that he believes in me, that I can give more than I’m giving now. It’s good when you have that support from your coach. You feel stronger and I hope I can improve this year because I understand some things better because it’s been a year with him, and he’s given me that support<br /><br /><b>[In his quest for regular playing time this season, Masuaku is faced with competition from <a href="aaron-cresswell.html">Aaron Cresswell</a> and Ben Johnson but he has welcomed the challenge as it helps them get better]</b> You need that competition in each position. Cress is my guy; Ben as well. We’re all trying to give our best to play. I think it will be the best one in the moment that will play. If Cress is ahead of me, I will try to just give my best to be ahead of him. Ben as well. It’s good. We’re very good at playing in the same position</p>
