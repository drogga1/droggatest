  <p><b>[Japan sack Vahid Halilhodzic two months before World Cup]</b> You never know what can happen in football. We’ll do everything we can to produce good results <b>[at the World Cup]</b>. It’s all about results in this game</p>

  <p><b>[Japan veteran Maya Yoshida desperate to move on from <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>’s capitulation against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Even when I was in a small club starting out we conceded many goals, but not like this. It was shame, we really embarrassed ourselves. It was a disaster, it shouldn’t happen of course, but it’s done, it’s gone and we have to go forward. We can’t change the past so we have to focus on the future. From the next day after the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> game we tried to prepare well for the games with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, one of the best clubs in the world. We knew we had two games in front of us against them so we had to show good character. I thought we did well in the cup game, but we have to keep showing our character now, to fight and play for our pride and the supporters. We are trying to be as a team. We know and understand how important it is to be as one. The manager has tried to handle it well and we just believe our way, which will be the right way. The trust is easy to destroy, difficult to build up, so we need time to get it back. City are tough opponents, we know how hard this will be, but still we will fight as one together and die together. Not one guy goes this way or the other, we are together. We have had a lot of team meetings and discussed how we wanted to move in the right way. We are still a team<br /><br /><b>[Yoshida knows they are fighting for survival]</b> The last three seasons has been tough for us, for me as well. We are used to finishing in the top half of the table and now it’s a relegation fight. But we are ready for this fight. We still have confidence and we need to get back on the right track as quickly as possible<br /><br /><b>[He is set to win his 100th cap for his country in the World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan on November 14 and the 31-year-old said]</b> It’s always a pleasure to be part of the national team, appreciate my family and team-mates, the medical staff, everyone. I couldn’t imagine anything like this when I was young, never. I started from a small city, was struggling to get 11 kids to play. Then I went to Nagoya with Grampus and everyone said it’s difficult, then I went to Holland and people said it’s too early, you’re too young to go there, and then they said an Asian player can never be a success in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Now I am here all these years and how many caps? It’s all good<br /><br /><b>[So good that Yoshida is also eyeing a third appearance in the World Cup finals when it is hosted by Qatar in 2022]</b> I hope to play in Qatar, otherwise I would have already retired. Personally, in terms of my physical condition it’s really good so I had no doubt I could go on and play in the next World Cup. Before the last one I decided to look at my future to see if I should continue, but in this moment I have decided to keep going and we are doing well so far in the qualifiers. I have good memories of Qatar, we won the Asian Cup there in 2011, and the hospitality was very good. I have no doubt the World Cup will be a success there</p>

  <p><b>[Maya Yoshida’s seven-and-a-half-year journey at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> came to an end when <a href="southampton-fc.html">the Saints</a> loaned the Japan international to <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> on deadline day for the final six months of his current deal]</b> Nobody expected me to leave <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>. The media, teammates, fans, or staff. I felt good there, but I played little. It was a dilemma. In the end, I had the courage to try and the desire to improve further to go further. Instead of being content to sit on the bench and witness the generational change from there, I would like to play again and be the protagonist of the matches and my career.</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> defender Maya Yoshida was won over by his first game at the Stadio Ferraris, also known as Marassi]</b> <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> strikers dive too much. My first experience of the Ferraris was excellent, as it’s a stadium built for football, so it reminds me of the English arenas. The fans are very close to the pitch and cheer you on for the whole game. I am ready to play and hoped that I would get my chance to debut, but I’ll keep training and wait for my opportunity. Working hard is the only way I can earn my playing time. I have already realised you need to be wary as a defender in Italy, as the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> strikers dive too much. That doesn’t happen as much in the Premier League</p>
