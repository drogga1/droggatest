  <p><b>[Mexico, United States not included as CONMEBOL]</b> The 2019 Copa America Brazil will be a passionate competition in which anyone can win the title. In addition to having the participation of the national teams from our 10 member associations, we’re once again welcoming the Japan national team, whose association we have a close link of friendship and good relationship with. And, for the first time, we’ll have the participation of the Qatar national team, which will be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Chile’s capital city Santiago has been chosen by CONMEBOL as the venue for the first single Copa Libertadores final]</b> These decisions are in line with our strategic goal of improving the sporting development of South American football through greater resources, more investment and better standards across the board. Besides generating more income to re-invest in sporting development, the single finals will be a great opportunity for South America to take a big leap forward in sporting infrastructure, event organisation, security controls, comfort and services in our stadiums, and in the regional and world promotion of our tournaments, clubs and players. The single finals of the CONMEBOL Libertadores and Sudamericana will be events that inspire all us South Americans to think big.</p>

  <p><b>[CONMEBOL propose rearranged Copa Libertadores final be played outside Argentina]</b> It is a shame that we are in a situation like this because of some misfits. The image that has been sent to the world is the wrong one, this is not the football that we want. The conditions are not equal, given there is a team that was attacked. When the teams of each club enter the field, we want there to be equal conditions. We want to see a show. We believe that we must send a signal that there are no excuses. Let the team who scores more goals on the pitch win. The board of CONMEBOL has taken the decision that there is no equality in the current conditions. We have to provide the conditions so that both clubs have the ideal conditions for the final to be played. We will meet with the presidents of Boca and River in Asuncion to find a date and play this game.</p>

  <p><b>[CONMEBOL is lobbying FIFA to stage the World Cup every two years]</b> The proposal we have made to FIFA is to play the World Cup every two years and not every four. Instead of having the Nations League in between we can just go ahead every two years and have a World Cup and that is for everyone. It’s for the players because they could play four World Cups if we move to a two-year cycle. If we stay with this format many players will not be able to play more than two. There are many solutions. We could hold the tournament in Europe, South America, North America, Africa and Asia without such a long wait. So we see an opportunity there and there is a proposal put forward to FIFA.<br /><br /><b>[Dominguez also extolled the financial virtues of increasing the World Cup frequency]</b> In terms of economics FIFA make money and give more money</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Copa America pushed back to 2021 as global pandemic rages on]</b> This is an extraordinary measure for an unexpected situation and responds to the fundamental need to avoid the exponential evolution of the virus. It wasn’t easy to take this decision but we must safeguard at all times the health of our players and all those who form part of the big South American football family. Have no doubts that the oldest international tournament in the world will be back stronger than ever in 2021</p>
