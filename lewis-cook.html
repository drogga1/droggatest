  <p><b>[Lewis Cook speaks about being mentioned in the same sentence as England 1966 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore after captaining the Young Lions to victory at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup Korea Republic 2017]</b> To be mentioned straight after in the same sentence as him was crazy. Our team, our age group, have been together so long now, we knew each other, we could relax with each other and have a good time around the camp. Having that friendship really made it just like playing with your mates on the pitch in a World Cup - it is pretty mad</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Cook speaks about winning the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup Korea Republic 2017]</b> My parents live in Yorkshire and they keep the medal in a safe. It is not on display. I don’t think it will sink in for a few years and maybe not until I’ve stopped playing. It was an amazing day. We watched pre-match videos at the hotel from <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>. Then I gave the pre-match talk on the pitch in the huddle. My message was simple, ‘Play our own game, the biggest game of our lives, fight for England but, above all, enjoy yourself’. To win it … it is crazy to be mentioned in the same sentence as Bobby Moore. It means I have achieved something significant. It is hard to put into words what it feels like to lift a trophy for England. My family - parents, grandparents, my girlfriend … unfortunately not my dog - came out to South Korea</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Cook’s verdict on <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> and their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> plight]</b> That’s where they belong, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I don’t know if they would want to go up that way (with a 22-team league). They would want to play the rest of the season and go up as champions probably, because they were on course to do that. I would be happy for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> to be in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but we will see what happens</p>
