The club’s preference would have been for Billy to stay at Rangers but when he made clear his desire to move to the Premier League it was important that we maximised the commercial value for him. We believe we have done this.<br /><br />The agreement will provide Rangers with a significant sum for a young player who has yet to play first-team football, and further significant amounts could be due based on milestones being reached. We are pleased with this outcome and believe this deal represents good value for Rangers.<br /><br />That he was sought after by many Premiership clubs, and indeed a number of the largest clubs in Europe, further demonstrates the quality of player now being produced by the Academy. Everyone at Rangers wishes Billy well for his future.</p>

  <p><b>[The director of Chelsea’s stadium project team has had a cheeky dig at Tottenham as the clubs both prepare to upgrade their venues in the coming years. Hugh Rosen said]</b> To be fair to Tottenham, they are not just looking for football. They are looking for American Football, looking at rugby and as far as I am concerned if they can’t win at football they are welcome to try any other sport they like.<br /><br />For us, Roman <b>[Abramovich]</b> gave us one brief, the whole stadium, the billion pounds or whatever it is going to cost, is about winning football matches. There is nothing else. There are no pop concerts, no boxing, no American Football and no other team, just our home priority.<br /><br />Everything was designed around the existing centre spot, it doesn’t move and everything revolves around that. Here we are, 112 years into our history trying to rebuild our stadium for the fifth time on our own site, around our own pitch. There are 13 London clubs, this is the only one that has never moved home ground and never will move home ground<br /><br />We are not in a position yet to start and therefore not in the right position to know yet when we are going to finish. In the end it doesn’t really matter. When history is written in 100 years’ time no one is going to care if it was 2022, 2021, 2020. What matters most to us, and as the owner also said, it is about getting the timing right. So as soon as we know we will let you know. There is no date yet. It will be the finest stadium in Stamford Bridge since the last one, the one before that and the one we all grew up in.<br /><br />It’s all about Chelsea and building the best stadium we can for ourselves. It is about continuity. Our badge, our crest is a lion, it looks like a lollipop stick but in fact it is a shepherd’s crook in the paws of the lion. When the club was founded in the Rising Sun in 1905 the group of friends that founded it included the Abbot of Westminster and his device is the shepherd’s crook of Westminster Abbey.<br /><br />We found that to connect the club to the building, where everyone recognises it as a London building, it has been there to stand the test of time, people congregate there once a week and sing a little. This for us was a good exemplar of what Stamford Bridge should look like. So when you see the stadium, it is a 21st century homage to Westminster Abbey. That’s why it is very deliberately done for Chelsea to symbolise our home. Jimmy Greaves said this was the best part of London</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea ban supporter for life over racial abuse allegations after <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> incident]</b> The club delayed reaching its decision in these cases in order to ensure that it did not prejudice the related police investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service has, however, recently announced that it has elected not to initiate any criminal prosecutions. This allowed the club to conduct its own investigation, which included seeking representations from the individuals concerned, reviewing video evidence, interviewing potential witnesses and obtaining expert opinions from two lip reading professionals. All individuals sanctioned as a result of our investigation were then offered the right to appeal and, where applicable, those appeals have been heard<br /><br />We understand that this incident has been the subject of discussion amongst supporters, and the club appreciates that emotions can run high during matches. However, in this case the behaviour of all six individuals crossed the line of what is acceptable. Furthermore, in the case of the supporter who was found by the club to have used racially abusive language, there is no place for this behaviour at Stamford Bridge and a permanent exclusion was the appropriate sanction. Given the particular circumstances of this case, the club did not consider that attendance at an education course in return for a reduced sanction would have been appropriate</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea apologise over ‘unchallenged’ sex abuse by former club scout Eddie Heath. Evidence from 23 witnesses paints a grim picture of the historic abuse]</b> The board wishes to thank all the survivors and witnesses who came forward to assist the reviews and the club apologises unreservedly for the terrible past experiences of some of our former players<br /><br />It is evident from the review that Heath was a dangerous and prolific child abuser. His conduct was beyond reprehensible. The report details how abuse was able to occur unchallenged, and the life-changing impact it had on those affected<br /><br />Although the club today is a very different place from the club then, with new ownership, operational structures and safeguarding procedures in place, we will not shy away from responsibility for what happened in the past. The intention of the review was to shine a bright light in the dark corners of the club’s history so that we can learn lessons to help protect the players of the future. We also have no desire to hide any non-recent abuse we uncover<br /><br />We must continue to challenge ourselves to do better as a club and as a sport. This is an issue that has affected all of football. Police data indicated that by March 2018, 340 clubs had already been impacted, 300 alleged perpetrators identified and over 2,800 referrals and reports received. Tragically the number of victims stood at almost 850. While we implement the recommendations of the report, it is important that we also look to the future and ensure that abuse like this never happens again anywhere in football. Survivors of child sexual abuse are also able to claim compensation by writing to the club. Claims for compensation are being assessed and managed by the club’s insurer and the club will support survivors through the process</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea ticket touts arrested and jailed outside Stamford Bridge]</b> Chelsea Football Club has taken legal action against 11 ticket touts, one of whom has received a six-month jail sentence, operating in the locality of Stamford Bridge on and around matchdays. The High Court has ordered injunctions which stop these touts from trading in tickets to matches at Stamford Bridge as well as preventing them from loitering or waiting near the ground prior to matchdays. The club will act to fully enforce these orders. Breaching the orders imposed by the Court can lead to serious sanctions, including prison sentences. One of these touts has been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for contempt of court in connection with an injunction.<br /><br />All 11 touts have been ordered to pay the club’s costs incurred in putting a stop to their touting behaviour. This amounts to more than £170,000 in total. This action is part of an on-going undercover operation which will continue throughout the 2019/20 season. Ticket touting is known to have links to organised crime. The above action taken against touts operating around Stamford Bridge sends a strong message to others looking to engage in such criminal and anti-social behaviour.<br /><br />Chelsea Football Club already employs a series of visible preventative measures on matchdays to protect our supporters from touting, including signage outside the stadium and along the Fulham Road to inform visitors of the risks of purchasing tickets from unofficial sources. We have also agreed the installation of additional signage and matchday messages at Fulham Broadway station. The club operates a Ticket Exchange policy which enables season ticket holders and members who cannot attend a match the opportunity to lawfully sell their ticket in a safe, secure and reliable online environment to other season ticket holders and members. We remain committed to working alongside the Metropolitan Police and Local Authority to eradicate ticket touting from Stamford Bridge and will continue to operate a comprehensive and long-term operation to combat this problem. We will also continue to work alongside other organisations and venues on anti-touting techniques.<br /><br />This football club will not tolerate touting and will continue to identify offenders and take further legal action through the Courts to ensure that our club and the surrounding area are safe for our loyal supporters and visitors. Individuals found in possession of unlawfully purchased tickets will be refused entry to the stadium or removed from it.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea slam <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> for transfer ban after <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> let off with no punishment]</b> Chelsea is grateful to <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a> for the diligent approach that it gave this matter. The club has not yet received the written reasons for CAS’s decision but wishes to make the following clear:<br /><br />1. The approach taken by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to this case has been deeply unsatisfactory, not least as <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> chose to treat Chelsea entirely differently to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for reasons that make absolutely no sense to Chelsea.<br /><br />2. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> accused Chelsea of having breached Article 19 of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations in relation to 27 players, covering the period from 2009 onwards. Of those, 16 players were registered by Chelsea in exactly the same way as other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs registered players at the time. Furthermore, Chelsea sought clarification from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in 2009 about whether it needed to apply for permission to register players in this category. <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> subsequently liaised with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and it was confirmed to Chelsea that players in this category were entitled to register and that no special application was required (and in fact no special application process existed). Accordingly, the fact that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> brought charges against Chelsea for this category of player was perverse. We are grateful that this appears to have been corrected by <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a>.<br /><br />3. In relation to the remaining 11 players, Chelsea’s position was as follows:<br /><br />a. Six players qualified for one of the exceptions set out in the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations. As a consequence, to the extent there was any breach in relation to these players, the breaches were of a procedural nature only.<br /><br />b. With respect to the remaining five players, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s position was that it deemed these players to have registered prior to any application for registration being made. Chelsea maintains, as was held by CAS in the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> case, that the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations do not cover a concept of deemed registrations and accordingly it is not open to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to deem that registrations were made before they were in fact made.<br /><br />4. Chelsea respects the importance of the work undertaken by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> in relation to the protection of minors and has fully cooperated with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> throughout its investigation. However, if <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> continues to impose inconsistent and unequal sanctions on clubs then it will not only undermine the very purpose of the regulations, but it will also bring into doubt the game’s confidence in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> being able to appropriately regulate this important area.</p>
