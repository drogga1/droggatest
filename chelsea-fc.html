How did Chelsea sign Mateo Kovacic when they have a transfer ban? Chelsea have made their first purchase of the summer in Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic despite <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> recently slapping a two-window transfer ban on the club due to its conduct regarding signing foreign minors. Despite being banned by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> from signing players for the next 12 months until the 2020 summer window, Chelsea managed to acquire Kovacic permanently because of a loophole in their transfer suspension. he Croatian joined the club on loan for the duration of last season and the agreement between Chelsea and Real Madrid stipulated the Blues had the option to purchase Kovacic for €45m before June 30, 2019. Because Kovacic’s loan deal between the two clubs was signed off on before Chelsea’s transfer ban was implemented in February, they can sign the player permanently without flouting the rules</p>

Evidence from 23 witnesses paints a grim picture of the historic abuse]</b> The board wishes to thank all the survivors and witnesses who came forward to assist the reviews and the club apologises unreservedly for the terrible past experiences of some of our former players<br /><br />It is evident from the review that Heath was a dangerous and prolific child abuser. His conduct was beyond reprehensible. The report details how abuse was able to occur unchallenged, and the life-changing impact it had on those affected<br /><br />Although the club today is a very different place from the club then, with new ownership, operational structures and safeguarding procedures in place, we will not shy away from responsibility for what happened in the past. The intention of the review was to shine a bright light in the dark corners of the club’s history so that we can learn lessons to help protect the players of the future. We also have no desire to hide any non-recent abuse we uncover<br /><br />We must continue to challenge ourselves to do better as a club and as a sport. This is an issue that has affected all of football. Police data indicated that by March 2018, 340 clubs had already been impacted, 300 alleged perpetrators identified and over 2,800 referrals and reports received. Tragically the number of victims stood at almost 850. While we implement the recommendations of the report, it is important that we also look to the future and ensure that abuse like this never happens again anywhere in football. Survivors of child sexual abuse are also able to claim compensation by writing to the club. Claims for compensation are being assessed and managed by the club’s insurer and the club will support survivors through the process</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea apologise over ‘unchallenged’ sex abuse by former club scout Eddie Heath. Evidence from 23 witnesses paints a grim picture of the historic abuse. One witness told the review]</b> The boys all knew it was safety in numbers; you didn’t want to be the last in the van, you risked being groped by him or having your bum slapped. He was regarded as ‘nightmare Eddie’. I think all associated with the youth team knew or suspected something as there was so much talk about it between the boys there. I did not talk to any adults about what was happening at the club<br /><br /><b>[Former Chelsea assistant manager Dario Gradi, who denies any wrongdoing, is also criticised in the report]</b> <b>[Witness]</b> AV reported his complaint of abuse by Mr Heath to Mr Gradi. Mr Gradi did not make the management of the club aware of the complaint. Mr Gradi’s inaction cannot be said to be ‘inappropriate’ as specifically defined by the terms of reference nor can it be said to have been contrary to any child protection or safeguarding rules or procedure in place at that time. My judgement that his response was inadequate is made by reference to the mores and expectations of the time as to responsible adult behaviour. I have concluded that he should have reported the matter to more senior staff. Accepted practice at the time would have been to do so and he failed to act</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea ticket touts arrested and jailed outside Stamford Bridge]</b> Chelsea Football Club has taken legal action against 11 ticket touts, one of whom has received a six-month jail sentence, operating in the locality of Stamford Bridge on and around matchdays. The High Court has ordered injunctions which stop these touts from trading in tickets to matches at Stamford Bridge as well as preventing them from loitering or waiting near the ground prior to matchdays. The club will act to fully enforce these orders. Breaching the orders imposed by the Court can lead to serious sanctions, including prison sentences. One of these touts has been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for contempt of court in connection with an injunction.<br /><br />All 11 touts have been ordered to pay the club’s costs incurred in putting a stop to their touting behaviour. This amounts to more than £170,000 in total. This action is part of an on-going undercover operation which will continue throughout the 2019/20 season. Ticket touting is known to have links to organised crime. The above action taken against touts operating around Stamford Bridge sends a strong message to others looking to engage in such criminal and anti-social behaviour.<br /><br />Chelsea Football Club already employs a series of visible preventative measures on matchdays to protect our supporters from touting, including signage outside the stadium and along the Fulham Road to inform visitors of the risks of purchasing tickets from unofficial sources. We have also agreed the installation of additional signage and matchday messages at Fulham Broadway station. The club operates a Ticket Exchange policy which enables season ticket holders and members who cannot attend a match the opportunity to lawfully sell their ticket in a safe, secure and reliable online environment to other season ticket holders and members. We remain committed to working alongside the Metropolitan Police and Local Authority to eradicate ticket touting from Stamford Bridge and will continue to operate a comprehensive and long-term operation to combat this problem. We will also continue to work alongside other organisations and venues on anti-touting techniques.<br /><br />This football club will not tolerate touting and will continue to identify offenders and take further legal action through the Courts to ensure that our club and the surrounding area are safe for our loyal supporters and visitors. Individuals found in possession of unlawfully purchased tickets will be refused entry to the stadium or removed from it.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea slam <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> for transfer ban after <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> let off with no punishment]</b> Chelsea is grateful to <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a> for the diligent approach that it gave this matter. The club has not yet received the written reasons for CAS’s decision but wishes to make the following clear:<br /><br />1. The approach taken by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to this case has been deeply unsatisfactory, not least as <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> chose to treat Chelsea entirely differently to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for reasons that make absolutely no sense to Chelsea.<br /><br />2. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> accused Chelsea of having breached Article 19 of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations in relation to 27 players, covering the period from 2009 onwards. Of those, 16 players were registered by Chelsea in exactly the same way as other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs registered players at the time. Furthermore, Chelsea sought clarification from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in 2009 about whether it needed to apply for permission to register players in this category. The FA subsequently liaised with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and it was confirmed to Chelsea that players in this category were entitled to register and that no special application was required (and in fact no special application process existed). Accordingly, the fact that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> brought charges against Chelsea for this category of player was perverse. We are grateful that this appears to have been corrected by <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a>.<br /><br />3. In relation to the remaining 11 players, Chelsea’s position was as follows:<br /><br />a. Six players qualified for one of the exceptions set out in the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations. As a consequence, to the extent there was any breach in relation to these players, the breaches were of a procedural nature only.<br /><br />b. With respect to the remaining five players, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s position was that it deemed these players to have registered prior to any application for registration being made. Chelsea maintains, as was held by CAS in the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> case, that the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regulations do not cover a concept of deemed registrations and accordingly it is not open to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to deem that registrations were made before they were in fact made.<br /><br />4. Chelsea respects the importance of the work undertaken by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> in relation to the protection of minors and has fully cooperated with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> throughout its investigation. However, if <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> continues to impose inconsistent and unequal sanctions on clubs then it will not only undermine the very purpose of the regulations, but it will also bring into doubt the game’s confidence in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> being able to appropriately regulate this important area.</p>
