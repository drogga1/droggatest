  <p><b>[Portland Timbers hope key additions take them back to the top]</b> The idea of Caleb is to get a strong midfield so we have Diego and David, Seba, Darlington and me, that we create good numbers from the middle which is where most of the game is decided. David can help us defensively to be more balanced without and with the ball. Seba can help us create a little more, to get more movement and dynamic in the middle and obviously to score some goals. He’s very dynamic and very creative. They can help a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The Canadian teenager Bayern beat out Europe’s best to buy]</b> You can see that he’s mentally very mature. As a 17-year-old, the way he plays is like a 25-year-old. In just one season he’s a very different player and that says a lot about his mentality.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Valeri gives Timbers star power needed to push past FC Dallas]</b> I think the hero was the team. It was an ugly game. They played well and we fought for this and we advanced, and that’s what we wanted so I’m very happy about the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls and Timbers facing long odds to book MLS Cup places]</b> Whenever you have a match played in these conditions, the weather is going to affect it, profoundly. But more important than that, when you begin a game like this, one that gives you a chance to win a cup, you have to have the fortitude to overcome anything.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United versus Portland Timbers has distinct Latin American flavor]</b> It’s very important to set the tone early and manage the time of the game. The game has different moments, and in order for us to be calm, and not feel that tension from outside, we have to be focused on every single ball and be precise and effective to win the ball.</p>
