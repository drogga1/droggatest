  <p><b>[Lazio president Claudio Lotito insists it will be harder to keep star player Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in the current transfer window]</b> We’ve created a glasshouse, where it’s understood that people can’t be forced to perform their roles in an environment where they feel cramped. Milinkovic has shown sincerity and responsibility, so that isn’t the case with him. He feels good here. Last year I managed to resist the assaults of other clubs, but this year I’d have fewer weapons if a different solution was proposed to the player. Let’s say that I used up some of my weapons last year</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio president Claudio Lotito has confirmed Lazio will consider offers for Sergej Milinkovic-Savic amid growing transfer links to Manchester United]</b> As I said a long time ago, it doesn’t matter how hard it could be <b>[to keep Milinkovic-Savic]</b>. We will see what the market can offer and all the conditions that are going to be. We <b>[as a club]</b> feel great with Milinkovic, as he feels with the club. Offers, if there will be any, will be considered in a spirit of cooperation in order to guarantee both the interests of the club and the player<br /><br /><b>[Despite that recruitment drive, Simone Inzaghi’s team had a disappointing season, finishing eighth in the Italian top flight]</b> The investments we made last summer should’ve allowed us to qualify for the Champions League, but we hope to have learned from the experience</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio chief Claudio Lotito has claimed that monkey chants from supporters are not always racist, in the wake of widespread allegations of abuse in Serie A]</b> he ‘buu’ chants don’t always correspond to a discriminatory or racist act. I remember when I was little, often people who were not black, who had normal, white skin, were booed by other players to discourage them from scoring a goal. It should be interpreted in the right way. We have so many black players, I don’t think that Lazio makes a distinction between skin colour. The club’s behaviour from this point of view is right in front of everyone’s eyes</p>

  <p><b>[Lotito’s comments sparked a backlash from the public and the club moved to exonerate the president from any wrongdoing with an official statement on Wednesday]</b> An inappropriate term has provoked an exaggerated twisting of words and conveyed a message in stark contrast to all the long-established initiatives implemented by the club for the defence of ethical and moral values to which president Claudio Lotito has always been aligned and have always placed him in the front line against any form of discrimination</p>

  <p><b>[In February 2015, Lazio president Claudio Lotito was recorded bemoaning the fact that two tiny clubs, Frosinone and Carpi, were in contention for promotion to Serie A]</b> If teams come up who are not worth a cent, in two or three years we won’t have a penny. I’ve done well in selling the TV rights. We brought in €1.2bn (£1bn/$1.35bn) thanks to my skill <b>[…]</b> If in three years we have Latina and Frosinone, who would buy those rights? They don’t even know where Frosinone is!</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio owner Claudio Lotito says he would accept a one-off match with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to decide the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title if the season cannot be resumed]</b> Yes, I would accept it. But I never asked myself the question. Starting the season again disadvantages us in a way. We had made a choice; believing that we could not play on three fronts, we had sacrificed the Europa League, because for timing and transfers it was the most uncomfortable competition. So, we would be able to play once a week while other teams played twice. If we start again, we would all play twice a week, so we would lose that advantage. But I think about the interests of 20 clubs. Today we are one point away from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. But in the first game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> we won 3-1 and also in the Super Cup we won 3-1, and we still had to play another match. For fairness, a team like Inter, who have eight points less than us, or Atalanta, who have 14 points less - tell me if they should be involved.<br /><br />At Lazio I have an excellent structure. I already have swabs and serological tests, and I have masks. In <b>[Lazio’s training base at]</b> Formello I have the cardiologist, the internist, the otolaryngologist and the urologist. I am able to do sanitation immediately, my company works in hospitals</p>
