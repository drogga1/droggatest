  <p><b>[Have Man Utd dodged a €100m bullet as Milinkovic-Savic’s form nosedives at Lazio?]</b> We had a plan to replace him, but there wasn’t enough time. When a bid arrives on August 17 and the market shuts a day later, I couldn’t sell him. I won’t mention figures, but certainly it was an obscene offer that I think no-one else in Italy could’ve refused.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and the many suitors of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic have been offered transfer hope by Lazio]</b> In today’s football, it’s difficult for a player to tie himself to just one club for the rest of his career, but at Lazio we are doing well. Our players show great affection to the club. Milinkovic-Savic? Unfortunately, Lazio don’t have the same economic potential as Barcelona and Real Madrid. When the conditions are on our side, and an offer you can’t refuse arrives, then we will face the matter.</p>

Milinkovic has shown sincerity and responsibility, so that isn’t the case with him. He feels good here. Last year I managed to resist the assaults of other clubs, but this year I’d have fewer weapons if a different solution was proposed to the player. Let’s say that I used up some of my weapons last year</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> chief Claudio Lotito has claimed that monkey chants from supporters are not always racist, in the wake of widespread allegations of abuse in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>]</b> he ‘buu’ chants don’t always correspond to a discriminatory or racist act. I remember when I was little, often people who were not black, who had normal, white skin, were booed by other players to discourage them from scoring a goal. It should be interpreted in the right way. We have so many black players, I don’t think that <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> makes a distinction between skin colour. The club’s behaviour from this point of view is right in front of everyone’s eyes</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> owner Claudio Lotito says he would accept a one-off match with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to decide the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title if the season cannot be resumed]</b> Yes, I would accept it. But I never asked myself the question. Starting the season again disadvantages us in a way. We had made a choice; believing that we could not play on three fronts, we had sacrificed the Europa League, because for timing and transfers it was the most uncomfortable competition. So, we would be able to play once a week while other teams played twice. If we start again, we would all play twice a week, so we would lose that advantage. But I think about the interests of 20 clubs. Today we are one point away from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. But in the first game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> we won 3-1 and also in the Super Cup we won 3-1, and we still had to play another match. For fairness, a team like Inter, who have eight points less than us, or Atalanta, who have 14 points less - tell me if they should be involved.<br /><br />At <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> I have an excellent structure. I already have swabs and serological tests, and I have masks. In <b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>’s training base at]</b> Formello I have the cardiologist, the internist, the otolaryngologist and the urologist.
