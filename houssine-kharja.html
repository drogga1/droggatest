  <p><b>[Former Morocco international Houssine Kharja says Inter have been following <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a> for two years]</b> <b>[Inter director Piero]</b> <a href="piero-ausilio.html">Ausilio</a> has been following him for a long time. Two and a half years ago, when he was still at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and was not playing, he started asking me about him several times. Inter is a major club, and <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s tactics will be perfect for him.<br /><br />He is very strong, in all the years of the national team I have never seen anyone like him. He is very intelligent, he will be able to adapt to Italian football. He may struggle in the defensive phase, perhaps at the beginning, but he will certainly be helped. After all, even Maicon had some difficulties, then he won the treble. <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a> is ready and will improve. <br /><br />Playing in a stadium like San Siro will be an extra stimulus: he’s not afraid of anything, like me. He played in Madrid and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, also winning a Champions League. The Meazza can only charge him up.</p>
