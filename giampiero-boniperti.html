I can see him as being the future president of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and I would be happy if he took that role. I remember going to see him play and I saw he was made of champion material. I was lucky in my choice, and I am happy for him today</p>

  <p><b>[Boniperti says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> too weak to win Champions League]</b> To win in Europe we need to improve on our physical power. We need to get into this mentality of being physically strong as well as mentally<br /><br />Winning a championship is always difficult, but to win two in a row is far more difficult. Some say we won a mediocre championship but maybe they’re jealous. We should remember how difficult it is winning a title in Italy. It was <b>[difficult]</b> in the 70s, 80s, 90s and it still is</p>
