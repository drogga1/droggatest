  <p><b>[Adelaide United centre-back Taylor Regan has called on his team-mates to bite, scratch and pinch Newcastle Jets]</b> We have everything a good squad needs. We need momentum, we need results and winning’s a habit. Right now, we don’t have that habit. Tomorrow we need to bite them, scratch them, pinch them, do whatever we have to do to win.<br /><br />The ACL’s a bit of a fresh start too … there’s a Chinese team in Newcastle at the moment that have just drawn and lost, and that’s against NPL sides. So it’s a different league, you know, it’s a different feel about it. It’s not as physical as the A-League and as demanding and they’re in off-season. So we worry about that when it comes Wednesday but if we can get a good result tomorrow night here in front of the fans it gives the fans something to cheer even more on Wednesday<br /><br /><b>[On Kim Jae-sung and Baba Diawara]</b> A few fresh faces arriving and things like that - it always cheers the mood up - and they’re good characters. Baba, obviously, speaks Spanish better than he speaks English and Kim’s a character. He giggles at everything, even if he doesn’t know what’s being said he’s still giggling. At the moment the mood is ok. For the situation that it is, the mood’s good</p>

  <p><b>[Adelaide United defender Taylor Regan claimed his side ‘showed what Australian football is all about’ in their 3-3 draw with Jeju United in the AFC Champions League]</b> We were so disappointed to let the lead slip. We knew how to break them down. In the end, 3-3 is probably a fair result. When the chips are down, there’s only one thing to do and that’s fight. The boys showed spirit and we showed what Australian football is all about - that is working hard at the end of the day, even if you are outclassed.</p>
