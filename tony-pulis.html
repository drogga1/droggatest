  <p><b>[Former knock-out king Mike Tyson, an undisputed heavyweight boxing champion during the late 1980s, paid a visit to <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a>’s training ground this week]</b> Mike popped in for a few minutes and it was lovely to see him. The organisers are big Stoke supporters so they were keen to get him down here, if only for a couple of minutes. It was a bit of fun, but we didn’t get him stripped off for a bit of training on this occasion. It was just a chance to shake a few hands.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis believes Ryan Shawcross should forget about an England recall and pledge his allegiances to Wales]</b> I’m convinced he should be in the England squad and if that’s not going to happen then my attentions would be turned to crossing the border. If England don’t think he’s good enough, Wales certainly do. He would be joining a Wales team with a genuine chance of qualifying for Euro 2016, so there’s some big games to be had if he made that choice.<br /><br />I still think his best years are ahead of him. He has still to reach his peak and should become better over the next four or five years. It’s lovely that he is now recognised as a Stoke City player in an age when players are going from club to club. Everybody has ambitions to play for a top-four club, but Ryan couldn’t be at a better club than Stoke. The supporters love him and he has so much respect in the dressing room. But he’s earned that, it hasn’t just happened</p>

  <p><b>[West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis ahead of his club’s home match against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> You can get on a team bus now and the lads will stick their earphones on and get their computers out and do what they do. But I’m not into all the gadgets. I’m just a human being who enjoys other people’s company. When we were young, on coach trips to away games when I was at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>, there’d be four of us at the front of the bus. All we’d do is sit there and talk football. If we’d been up at Middlesbrough we’d talk football all the way back to <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. Unfortunately, I just don’t see that so much any more</p>

I don’t think you can criticise <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> too much. He’s a top player at international and club level.

They say he’s really happy at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. It’s a fabulous football club - the new stadium and training facilities are out of this world. But the boy wants to win. And he has a manager who wants to win as well. They most probably need the backing from <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> and the club in some way and it’ll be difficult because of the financial crisis that has hit the world.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is a fantastic manager and his record shows that, given the tools, he can win football matches. He needs time. The big problem in society today and especially in sport is that people think it will happen overnight. Fingers crossed they’ll give him time there.

  <p><b>[Tony Pulis thinks Liverpool-linked <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> should ‘settle down’ with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> while pushing for Spain role]</b> I think Adama always had the ability to play. The big thing was his confidence. I think I probably caught him at the right time. He had gone and worked for a few managers who weren’t enamoured enough to play him on a regular basis. I obviously knew him as a West Brom manager watching <b>[Aston]</b> Villa, watched him in the reserves a few times. His pace and balance was just extraordinary. Going to Middlesbrough, he wasn’t in the team when I got there but I wanted to make him a focal point of the team. We did that and the biggest thing with him is that he grew in confidence and he started to believe in himself<br /><br />I made him my best friend. He used to come in and make me a cup of coffee after lunch and we would sit down and watch videos. He became a friend and he knew he’d be first pick on the team sheet. And the team understood what we could get from him and what we couldn’t. Having said that, as the season progressed, he learned the other side of the game <b>[defensive]</b> well as well. You meet people in life who are really, really good people, and Adama is a really good person. You hope and pray those people get everything out of life that they possibly can<br /><br />He’s gone to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> - we didn’t want to get rid of him at Middlesbrough, but the only problem was the finances <b>[…]</b> He went to the right club, stepped up and has murdered it. I think he can only get better. His temperament and personality is first class. His next step, I speak to him now and then, his next step is to get a place in the Spanish side. I’ll be quite content for him, and I said this to him, to settle down. He seems happy at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. He’s playing under a manager that’s confident with him and gives the respect Adama needs. But Adama’s big challenge is seeing if he can get a place in the Spanish team and keep it.<br /><br /><b>[Pulis did not enjoy the same sort of relationship with striker <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Martin Braithwaite</a>, whom he is surprised to see now playing at <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> champions <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> He was completely different to Adama in personality. Different traits as a player. I never thought <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> wanted to be at Middlesbrough although he signed a contract. He spent more time telling me that he wanted to leave than be at the club. In the end I hope and pray that the club got a good price for him because they paid a lot for him. They certainly paid him an enormous amount of money wages-wise, it was just extraordinary. Am I surprised he’s gone to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>? Yes. Is he playing every week? I don’t know. Is he going to play every week? I don’t know. Was he my cup of tea? Adama was. <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> wasn’t.</p>

He’ll give credit to the other players around him, I’ve spoken to him and he’s done that. You don’t win the trophies he’s won for no reason. When you’ve got young players working with a top player who’s won everything in the game, it really inspires them</p>
