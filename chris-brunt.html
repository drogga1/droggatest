  <p><b>[Northern Ireland midfielder Chris Brunt, who missed out on EURO 2016 due to an injury, on his country’s support at the European finals in France]</b> They have been fantastic and a real credit to their country. I must admit I have not been singing the ‘Will Grigg’s on fire’ song about our striker myself but, like most people, I cannot get it out of my head. It has been fantastic to hear so many people singing it and even the Germany fans were joining in.</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Brunt speaks about the togetherness in the squad ahead of March’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup qualifiers]</b> There was a party of five from the Irish FA - including <a href="michael-o-neill.html">Michael O’Neill</a> - who were near <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> checking facilities before EURO 2016 and they came to see me the evening after my operation. I really appreciated it, it was something they didn’t have to do, but that’s the kind of group we have. The players and staff are all very much in it together and that proved it for me</p>
