  <p>[Ronaldo Economics report] The Bianconeri need to strongly capitalize on the acquisition of Ronaldo, especially in merchandising and sponsoring. The club still lag behind the main European superpowers in this area. In 2016/17 Manchester United FC, Barcelona FC, Real Madrid CF and FC Bayern München recorded €320 million, €288 million, €280 million and €344 million, respectively, more than twice as much Juventus FC’s figure of €120 million</p>

  <p>[Ronaldo Economics report] Monetising the inherent value in social media is crucial for clubs in order to stay competitive and to enhance their profitability. Club channels also provide a unique setting for partners and sponsors to activate their brands and, ultimately, increase their sponsorship value or return on investment. This is the area in which Juventus FC will have to make a major effort to fully leverage Ronaldo’s investment</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Manchester United have continued their financial dominance over Manchester City] While in the first season under analysis United registered revenues 39 per cent higher than City, in the last season such a gap was reduced to 17 per cent. These figures are a result of the wider international appeal gained by Manchester City FC in recent seasons, which is especially reflected in broadcast [+129 per cent over the seven seasons], thanks to constant UEFA Champions League participation unlike the Red Devils.</p>
