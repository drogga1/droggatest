  <p><b>[Danny Higginbotham says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> could be the answer to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s attacking woes against <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s lesser sides]</b> United played brilliantly to beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. They were also excellent in both their league and Carabao Cup wins over <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and picked up draws with decent displays against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. So United have done well against the traditional top six and they also beat <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. Their problems have been facing the so-called lesser teams. United have lost to <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>, while they drew with <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>. The reason they produce their best against the top teams is because they do not necessarily have to dominate possession. That creates space to run into for speedy attackers like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> and <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a>. But they now have to find a way of dealing with teams that are going to sit in against them - and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> could be the answer. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> wants athleticism going forward and <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> does not necessarily fall into that category. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, like Mata, is a player who can unlock opponents’ defences, but he also has the dynamism <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> likes<br /><br /><b>[Higginbotham thinks <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>’s presence alongside <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> could free up <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in a more advanced position]</b> <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>, who was excellent against City, is starting to develop and seems to benefit from having <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> beside him. It was hard to see what <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>’s midfield role was when he moved from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52m, but <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has simplified things for the Brazilian. He now brings, energy, endeavour and a bit of physicality sat in front of the two centre-backs. There is an opportunity for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> to play a 4-3-3 formation but I don’t think you start <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> as a No.10 - the Frenchman is someone who can arrive in that position and express himself. With <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> protecting the defence, that gives <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> licence to go forward and drift into that No.10 position. <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> is now playing with freedom, cutting in from the left flank. He is a far better player facing the opposition goal than having his back to it</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Higginbotham says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> can be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne after an impressive debut against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>]</b> I’m not saying him and De Bruyne are the same players. But at times last season and earlier this season, City played more of a 4-2-3-1 with De Bruyne as a No 10 and we have also seen De Bruyne in a more retracted position in a 4-3-3. Fernandes also has the ability to play in both positions<br /><br />The one thing United struggle with is creativity and that is probably why they are better on the counter-attack. In Fernandes they now have a player who can dictate either from deep or from higher up the pitch, depending on what the game demands. On Saturday he started in the No .10 position, but as the game went on he realised he could have more of an influence from deep positions because of how compact <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> were<br /><br />What really impressed me about Fernandes was as soon as he passed the ball, he was immediately looking to pick it up again. He doesn’t admire his pass, whether it is a ten-yard one or a 30-yarder. It was all about how he could get back on the ball. He looks like a man who, if he has players making the right movement off him, he will find them. Every time Fernandes picked the ball up there were players making runs because they trusted him. Against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> he had the most shots, the most shots on target, the most passes and the most passes in the opposition half. Boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is looking for leaders and one of the things that stood out was that he wanted the ball all the time, he wanted to take responsibility, no matter where he was on the pitch. As debuts go, it was impressive</p>
