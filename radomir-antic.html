<blockquote>
  <p>[Radomir Antic claims Antoine Griezmann needs to be offering more to the collective cause] As a coach I can’t accept that a player with his characteristics touches the ball only three times in 45 minutes. The other day against Leganes he scored from a set-piece, but how many plays did he participate in during Atletico’s game?<br /><br />Atletico have this year broken records for transfer costs. They have the biggest budget in the history of the club. This, in a way, forces them to offer something more than we are seeing in their football, because Atletico at this moment, with the stadium and the budget, has overcome to the previously modest version of Atletico. Routine kills the inspiration, and in this Atletico there is no inspiration. It has never been argued that Atletico has used 15 or 20 strikers in the last seven years and none of them have been enough good to play<br /><br />I don’t have anything against Vinicius, but the other day he hit a shot to the corner flag and because it ended in a goal [against Real Valladolid] he is being made out to be a phenomenon. There are always different points of view. Real Madrid have not had authority in their game for a long time<br /><br />It’s true that when you train Real Madrid, Barcelona or Atletico that it is not enough only to win. It’s something that should be kept in mind. For me, football is always a mirror of the society that it represents. That is why when we talk about Barcelona it’s ‘mes que un club’ [more than a club]. That is true because behind Barcelona there is a different society. Behind Real Madrid there is a different society and it is something that I had in mind with Atletico Madrid, which generally represents middle class people and never wants to be inferior to anyone</p>

  <p>[Radomir Antic feels that the Camp Nou side are the wrong club for Antoine Griezmann due to the way they set up under Ernesto Valverde] Griezmann is a playmaker and Barcelona play without midfielders. If they sign him he’ll end up on the bench because he won’t find a place in the team. It seems absurd to me that none of the three greats of Spanish football have ever considered signing the best passer in the world, which is none other than Kevin De Bruyne. Since when is [Luka] Modric the best passer in the world? I can’t even say what it means to see him win the Ballon d’Or as the best player in the world, it doesn’t make any sense. He doesn’t give assists or score goals. You need players like De Bruyne, not like [Eden] Hazard - players that make others play. Barcelona certainly do not need Griezmann. Real Madrid… maybe a little more..<br /><br />The club must sell some players and look at the market to build a new project. They have to protect their coach, who is not to blame for what is happening because everything was already going wrong before he arrived. They will make great signings because they don’t have any titles to throw away - all they have to think about is the summer transfer window, not football<br /><br />Theoretically, La Liga is already decided. But this is football and Barca have more commitments. They might think they have already won the league because of their advantage. They only have Valencia left to face in the Copa del Rey but other teams have nothing left other than their Liga matches so we’ll see what happens. Indeed, we saw Atletico play with three at the front and three midfielders in the 4-0 win over Alaves - it’s clear that formation gives them good results<br /><br />Messi has a groin strain and that’s very uncomfortable, he might rest because there’s an important match coming up against Manchester United [in the Champions League], but I don’t think he will after what happened against Villarreal. La Liga is the only time you can give players rest, it wouldn’t make sense to do so in the final of the Copa del Rey or in the Champions League. It’s clear that Man Utd is a club that deserves respect and Barca must face them with their best possible team. I don’t think Barca are better than last year but this season they are managing to win without shining thanks to Messi. I’m not in favour of comparing Messi’s seasons but it’s clear that some of the things he’s doing will be remembered forever. The goals he scored in Betis and against Espanyol are the work of genius<br /><br />First, I would sit him down and speak directly. I would ask him what we have to do to make him more comfortable, would he consider training in the morning to improve his attributes, of which he has many. Talking about it is the best solution for Barcelona. It’s fundamental that there is feedback between the two, a dialogue, to understand what the player is going through. The first step to solving a problem is to admit it exists</p>
