It’s an official match, it was not a good match. The first part we had enough opportunities but we had defensive errors and CSKA Moscow condemned us. We’re frustrated by the defeat at home but we finished first in the group and that was the objective. These are evaluations that the coach has to do, we are all fit to be here but it is difficult for Solari</p>
