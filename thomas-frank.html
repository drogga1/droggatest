  <p><b>[Thomas Frank discusses his decision to resign after club chairman Jan Bech Andersen posted negative comments about him in an online forum using his son’s username]</b> It is no secret that the relationship between Jan and me has been strained from time to time, and after the last days of massive media attention, he and I had a talk. Based on that talk, I have chosen to end the cooperation</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United vs Brentford. Thomas Frank’s men have won their last two away matches in the Championship]</b> It will be one of the toughest away games we can play. We are going up there confident, we know that we are a good side. We need to hit our top level Wednesday then we can go there and win. We hugely respect Leeds and what they can do, they have been looking bright and sharp from the start of the season. We know what to expect but what to expect doesn’t mean it will be easy</p>

  <p><b>[Brentford moved to within two points of the Championship’s automatic promotion places with a comfortable 3-0 victory at Reading]</b> Bryan had to work in his flat. And he did everything to stay as fit as he could. He had no symptoms so, in that way, it didn’t affect him. When you can’t train properly, that’s not the best. So we did what we could. As long as he was in a safe place, that was the most important thing<br /><br />This was a very good performance going away from home. We maintained another high level, especially on the defensive side of our game. That is a most important side of the game to be focused on. You have to be disciplined and stick to your structure. It is my now responsibility to make sure that we maintain our focus</p>

  <p><b>[Said Benrahma grabbed a hat-trick as Brentford kept up their bid for automatic promotion with a 3-0 victory over crisis club Wigan]</b> I think in general <b>[Benrahma]</b> has had a good season so far but he has absolutely hit the ground running after this coronavirus break. He has added extra to his game, such as arriving in the box, and these last four games he has been getting better and better, with his passing and his finishing<br /><br />I have to praise him for his work ethic. He worked extremely hard. He has been good, he needs to keep it up. Three goals a game would be good!</p>

  <p><b>[Brentford needed late goals from Said Benrahma and Ethan Pinnock to beat <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a> 2-1 and crank up the pressure on West Brom in the race for automatic promotion]</b> This is a massive win. I just had a feeling because of all the circumstances of this game it would be difficult. <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a> are a good side and they fighting for their lives. They are well structured. This win was big in terms of how we managed it and how we kept going. It would be easy to say it was just a matter of time before that winner went in, but I was still extremely happy when it did. It’s most important what we do, but I will probably watch West Brom vs Derby tomorrow night</p>

  <p><b>[Brentford manager Thomas Frank has been named the Championship Manager of the Month for June]</b> I am delighted to be named Manager of the Month, but this is not an award for me, it is an award for every member of staff and every player at Brentford. Throughout the lockdown period, and since we’ve been back at Jersey Road, everyone has been working so hard to get us into the best possible shape. This a reward for all that work with another, bigger, reward hopefully ahead in the coming weeks</p>

  <p><b>[In-form Said Benrahma scored two second-half goals as he inspired automatic promotion-chasing Brentford to a 3-1 victory over Derby at Pride Park]</b> We knew when we went into this restart we were 10 points off the top two so that was a very difficult task. Our aim was to win as many games as possible and first and foremost to secure a play-off place and then see what is happening but now, can we catch them (the top two)? Fantastic but if not, then we want to keep the momentum and good performances and take that into the play-offs. Right now, we are in a very good place and we just need to continue. I am spoiled with good players that it is a privilege to coach and be around</p>

Our aim was to win as many games as possible and first and foremost to secure a play-off place and then see what is happening… right now, we are in a very good place</p>

  <p><b>[Championship promotion race: Brentford to overhaul West Brom? <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> for title?]</b> It’s a privilege to be part of a team who is winning eight games straight. There’s some that are more important and bigger wins and this one was one of them, definitely. I think it was a fair and square win. In the end, I just need to praise my defence. That’s the single best area we’ve improved in this season. I think I will watch the West Brom game on Friday but mainly because I’ll be sitting on a bus heading to Stoke!</p>
