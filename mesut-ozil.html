<blockquote>
  <p><b>[q: How excited are you about the World Cup kicking off?]</b> It’s exciting just to be talking about the World Cup. It’s the biggest stage a footballer can reach. And for the fans as well<br /><br /><b>[q: What are you most looking forward to?]</b> Not many players get to play in a World Cup - it’s a special honour to participate. And I’m looking forward to getting to know South Africa better and meeting the best teams in the world with the best players<br /><br /><b>[q: Germany is regarded as a tournament team…]</b> And we want to prove it again. We have a lot of respect for our group opponents, but the goal is to get through as the top team in our group. After that, the dream is to win the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[q: Who are the favourites?]</b> Spain, of course, and Brazil, Argentina and Germany. But there are many teams that are strong and can get far<br /><br /><b>[q: You won the under-21 title with Germany. Do those experiences help now you’re on an even bigger stage?]</b> In the under-21 tournament we faced a lot of players from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Spain, some of whom we’ll meet again now - and some of the Spanish guys have won Euro 2008 already, so it’s going to be very exiting to see how they do this time. As far as the experience of the under 21 games are concerned, I think it does help, though it’s certainly a different level<br /><br /><b>[q: There are quite a few young players in the German team. How is the feeling going away for such a long time together?]</b> Your first international tournament is one of the things you never forget in your life. It is a new chapter and something you can keep as a secret wish, but it is not guaranteed. Everyone has special feelings about internationals. For me, I will never forget my first game for Germany. And I feel lucky because 10 years ago, younger players did not have the same options as they have today. The attitude regarding youngsters seems to have changed in general. Young players get more responsibility<br /><br /><b>[q: Why do you think that is?]</b> Young players have proved they can handle the pressure and that they are mature enough to play. Some clubs had to look to their youngsters due to money problems and the education has been improved a lot. I think it’s great to have guys like <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jerome Boateng</a>, <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a>, <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>, Marko Marin and <a href="sami-khedira.html">Sami Khedira</a>.<br /><br /><b>[q: You have Turkish roots, but you were born in Gelsenkirchen. Were you tempted to play for Turkey?]</b> I am third generation in Germany: my father grew up here. Turkey will always be a special country for me but I did not doubt my decision to play for Germany - ever. I started to play for Germany in the youth teams<br /><br /><b>[q: You left Schalke when you were very young. Did that help you grow up?]</b> It was really hard for me to leave my hometownToday people compare you with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s Diego and even <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. Did you expect that things would go that fast?]&lt;/b&gt; Well, I knew what I could do on the pitch from the junior games. What I was missing was the goals. That works much better today. That people speak about me and the big names is an honour, but I think I have a fair bit to go. One day I want to be among the best but today I am just 21.<br /><br /><b>[q: Which players did you want to be when you were growing up?]</b> My Idol was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. He was the most perfect player. His technique, shooting and headers, his ability to read games and boss them was fantastic</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[q: Have you always been a creator?]</b> Yes, I’ve been a playmaker since my youth. I love to play the deciding pass and enjoy setting up goals - and scoring them myself. When I was a kid, my big idol was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I don’t have role models now, but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> are consistently playing on a high level. They haven’t become World Footballers of the Year for nothing<br /><br /><b>[q: Players of your kind, like <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, are enjoying a resurgence]</b> Football is more physical than it used to be, but creativity hasn’t been lost. Football is a very physical and fast game, but smaller players can assert themselves. Look at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a><br /><br /><b>[q: Is it tough being considered the ‘main man’ in a team at just 21?]</b> I managed to cope very well. I enjoyed the trust of the managerial staff and the team. I don’t feel any pressure on the pitch. I simply love and enjoy playing football. The World Cup was an incredible experience - it’s the greatest thing for a footballer. The time in South Africa was unforgettable. We have a very young team with a great future and will be given another chance<br /><br /><b>[q: Any tips for budding young playmakers?]</b> Talent alone is not enough. I can give the kids out there the following piece of advice: you have to work hard every single day and try to improve daily. I have to improve in every aspect. My biggest aim for the new season is to score more goals<br /><br /><b>[q: What are your goals for the future?]</b> For every player it is something special to compete for the Champions League or win the World Cup. My personal goal is to become one of the best players in the world</p>

So if I think of something new I want to try it on the pitch and see how it works. It’s always been the case that I’ve scored goals like that in training, but in games I just shot normally. But I’ve noticed that sometimes it’s easier for me to score this way because the goalkeeper has already come out at you and if you try a chip, maybe a recovering defender can reach the ball before it crosses the line. So with this technique you kind of eliminate that because you hit the ball harder, it then travels faster and it’s harder to stop<br /><br /><b>[So was the ‘chop finish’ something he first thought of back then on the streets as a teenager?]</b> If I’d tried that shot on the concrete I would have ended up breaking my knee.

If that’s true, how do you explain our results in the ‘big’ games when I wasn’t involved? There’s no real difference. I know people expect me to offer more, dictate play and make the difference - I do, too - but it’s not that straightforward.<br /><br />I’m not the only player in the team and, don’t forget, some of our opponents are simply better than us.

Yes, it happened a few times - usually in the winter - but what am I supposed to do? If you knew me, you would know it takes a lot for me to miss a game and I have never used sickness as an excuse. Actually the opposite. I played many games when I was ill or had injuries.<br /><br />Before the Champions League game against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> <b>[in March 2017]</b>, I was sick and Arsene <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> told me I was not in the squad because of that.

I’m the same person at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as I was at Schalke, Werder Bremen, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and the German national team.

And why, after the World Cup last year, did I return from holiday early for the first time in my career to start training three days before I was expected back? I did it for the new coach, the team and the club. Maybe people don’t like that I have a good contract? I don’t know or care</p>

The health and well-being of everyone is far more important than everything else. Guys, take all the precautions you can - be mindful and considerate of everyone, especially those who are at high risk. As we go through this global issue, we should not forget to say thank you to all doctors, nurses and scientists etc worldwide, who are helping to keep this virus from spreading. They are under high pressure in the upcoming weeks and deserve our respect and gratitude</p>
