<blockquote>
  <p><b>[q: How excited are you about the World Cup kicking off?]</b> It’s exciting just to be talking about the World Cup. It’s the biggest stage a footballer can reach. And for the fans as well<br /><br /><b>[q: What are you most looking forward to?]</b> Not many players get to play in a World Cup - it’s a special honour to participate. And I’m looking forward to getting to know South Africa better and meeting the best teams in the world with the best players<br /><br /><b>[q: Germany is regarded as a tournament team…]</b> And we want to prove it again. We have a lot of respect for our group opponents, but the goal is to get through as the top team in our group. After that, the dream is to win the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[q: Who are the favourites?]</b> Spain, of course, and Brazil, Argentina and Germany. But there are many teams that are strong and can get far<br /><br /><b>[q: You won the under-21 title with Germany. Do those experiences help now you’re on an even bigger stage?]</b> In the under-21 tournament we faced a lot of players from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Spain, some of whom we’ll meet again now - and some of the Spanish guys have won Euro 2008 already, so it’s going to be very exiting to see how they do this time. As far as the experience of the under 21 games are concerned, I think it does help, though it’s certainly a different level<br /><br /><b>[q: There are quite a few young players in the German team. How is the feeling going away for such a long time together?]</b> Your first international tournament is one of the things you never forget in your life. It is a new chapter and something you can keep as a secret wish, but it is not guaranteed. Everyone has special feelings about internationals. For me, I will never forget my first game for Germany. And I feel lucky because 10 years ago, younger players did not have the same options as they have today. The attitude regarding youngsters seems to have changed in general. Young players get more responsibility<br /><br /><b>[q: Why do you think that is?]</b> Young players have proved they can handle the pressure and that they are mature enough to play. Some clubs had to look to their youngsters due to money problems and the education has been improved a lot. I think it’s great to have guys like <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jerome Boateng</a>, <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a>, <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>, Marko Marin and <a href="sami-khedira.html">Sami Khedira</a>.<br /><br /><b>[q: You have Turkish roots, but you were born in Gelsenkirchen. Were you tempted to play for Turkey?]</b> I am third generation in Germany: my father grew up here. Turkey will always be a special country for me but I did not doubt my decision to play for Germany - ever. I started to play for Germany in the youth teams<br /><br /><b>[q: You left Schalke when you were very young. Did that help you grow up?]</b> It was really hard for me to leave my hometownToday people compare you with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s Diego and even <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. Did you expect that things would go that fast?]&lt;/b&gt; Well, I knew what I could do on the pitch from the junior games. What I was missing was the goals. That works much better today. That people speak about me and the big names is an honour, but I think I have a fair bit to go. One day I want to be among the best but today I am just 21.<br /><br /><b>[q: Which players did you want to be when you were growing up?]</b> My Idol was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. He was the most perfect player. His technique, shooting and headers, his ability to read games and boss them was fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[q: Have you always been a creator?]</b> Yes, I’ve been a playmaker since my youth. I love to play the deciding pass and enjoy setting up goals - and scoring them myself. When I was a kid, my big idol was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I don’t have role models now, but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> are consistently playing on a high level. They haven’t become World Footballers of the Year for nothing<br /><br /><b>[q: Players of your kind, like <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, are enjoying a resurgence]</b> Football is more physical than it used to be, but creativity hasn’t been lost. Football is a very physical and fast game, but smaller players can assert themselves. Look at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a><br /><br /><b>[q: Is it tough being considered the ‘main man’ in a team at just 21?]</b> I managed to cope very well. I enjoyed the trust of the managerial staff and the team. I don’t feel any pressure on the pitch. I simply love and enjoy playing football. The World Cup was an incredible experience - it’s the greatest thing for a footballer. The time in South Africa was unforgettable. We have a very young team with a great future and will be given another chance<br /><br /><b>[q: Any tips for budding young playmakers?]</b> Talent alone is not enough. I can give the kids out there the following piece of advice: you have to work hard every single day and try to improve daily. I have to improve in every aspect. My biggest aim for the new season is to score more goals<br /><br /><b>[q: What are your goals for the future?]</b> For every player it is something special to compete for the Champions League or win the World Cup. My personal goal is to become one of the best players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal star Mesut Ozil’s agent has hit out at those that he perceives have made the German playmaker a scapegoat following the 5-1 thumping at the hands of Bayern Munich]</b> Bayern had 74 percent possession. How can someone in the No.10 position create chances if you don’t have the ball? In these games people usually target a player who cost a lot of money and earns a lot of money - that is Mesut. But he can’t be always be the scapegoat. That’s not fair<br /><br />Football is a team sport and Arsenal are not performing well as a team. Eleven players were on the pitch but Mesut was singled out for criticism. Was he the reason that Arsenal conceded five goals? It started before the match, throughout the week leading up to the game. People started discussing: ‘Should he play? Should he be dropped?’. It was as if everyone knew Arsenal would not make it through and we needed a scapegoat. This is not right. You win as a team and you lose as a team<br /><br />I don’t agree that Mesut has not had an impact on big matches. What about the win at home to Chelsea this season and Manchester United the year before? What about the games for Germany against Italy and France at Euro 2016? People are always saying Mesut is not fighting or tackling, that he has poor body language, but that is how he is. Believe me, he is desperate to succeed. If it doesn’t work, he shows his anger and expressions. Was his body language an issue when Arsenal were playing well? He is not someone who runs around aimlessly and tackles just so everyone thinks he is fighting. If it doesn’t make sense to run somewhere he will keep that power for the next run</p>

  <p><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> I understood why Mourinho screamed at me like that in front of the other players. Actually, it was quite easy to understand. He told me loud and clear: Mourinho never wanted me to rest! That I get out of my comfort-zone on the pitch. He wanted to strengthen me. He wanted to push me so far that my development as a player was never going to stop. Looking back now, Mourinho was right. When I came to Madrid, I had this attitude that playing well was sufficient. I was satisfied too quickly. Mourinho drove that attitude out of me</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal star Mesut Ozil believes that playing in the Premier League has made him a tougher player]</b> The Premier League is the toughest challenge I’ve experienced in football. If you can’t take it here, without whining, then you’re history. It’s something I had to get to grips with in the first few weeks and months after my switch from Real Madrid.<br /><br />Whereas in Spain the entire game is based on elegant ball play - even teams from lower leagues try the same - in England you have scratching, biting and fighting. In England, football is one tackle after another. There’s barely any respite. Generally this doesn’t happen in Spain because the ball is constantly on the move. Pass, pass, pass. The opponent rarely has the opportunity to intervene because the ball is already on the other side of the pitch<br /><br />In England you fail to notice how hard it is during the game itself and how many attacks the body sustains. You’re so full of adrenaline that you don’t feel the pain. But then, under the shower, you discover the ‘misery’. After some matches my shins have looked as if someone has gone at them with a hammer, covered in blue marks. I’ve had scratches on the neck and bruises on my back, shoulders and chest from opponents’ elbows welcoming me into the Premier League when the referee wasn’t watching<br /><br />Some opponents also gave me a right earful on the pitch soon after my move from Spain. I’d never heard anything like it before. Nowhere is there as much chit-chat as in England. There are some players who are permanently rabbiting on. And of course it’s not exactly friendly stuff<br /><br />For example, after I’d been brutally brought to the ground in one of my first encounters, the opponent hissed, ‘It’s not Real Madrid. We’re not in La Liga.’ And as my new best friend turned away he muttered: ‘Come on, get up boy,’ with a malicious grin. In an attempt to fight back I’d go running to the ref to begin with and try to ‘work’ him. Every player does it. We all try to influence the referee verbally, to raise his awareness if we’re worried about getting hurt.<br /><br />We complain so that the next time he’ll watch more carefully and spot if we’re kicked or elbowed. I do this just like Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben or Lionel Messi - all players who get kicked a lot because opponents are trying to disrupt their rhythm and because sometimes it’s the only way to stop them. But, to my great surprise, I was forced to realise that even the English referees have their very own form of communication. In my early days at Arsenal they dismissed my appeals in a way that made me think I’d misheard them. They’d say things such as ‘Don’t whinge. You’ve got to deal with it. Welcome to the Premier League<br /><br />Sledging from the opposition. Cutting comments from refs. And football that’s harder than anywhere else - that’s the Premier League. That’s English football. And that’s the football I’ve got used to and love today. At Arsenal I’ve grown tougher. I’ve learned to take so much more. I’ve toned a few more muscles than during my time at Real Madrid so I’m in a better position to meet the physical challenges</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil reveals how he phoned Wenger to ask for Arsenal move]</b> I called a number that I’d saved in my phone back in 2010. ‘Mr Wenger,’ I said, ‘I promised that you’d be the first person I’d contact if I were ever looking for another club. Now I am.<br /><br />Arsene Wenger told me that he had been keeping an eye on me the whole time and that he liked how I’d developed. And all of a sudden I had that positive feeling again, the one I’d had during our telephone conversation back in 2010. I sensed that this man, who I’d never met personally, had a very high opinion of me and trusted me. Exactly what I needed at this difficult time<br /><br />Of course, I’d hoped that Florentino Perez would back down and not punish me for the argument between him and my father. That he’d approach me again. But he didn’t. The relationship had cooled. I contacted another club because it seemed to be the only possible way out. Time was flying. There were thousands of things to sort out if I were to actually move to London. Was I sure that’s what I wanted? That this was what would make me happy? Jose Mourinho was astonished. ‘You didn’t say anything to me. I thought you wanted to finish your career at Real Madrid,’ he texted me.</p>

The Chinese were prepared to pay me £100 million net over a period of five years. A fairy tale amount of money that went beyond the limits of my imagination. In spite of this, it took me less than three minutes to decline the offer. My agent, Erkut, called me to let me know about the bid. He said: ‘I think we’re agreed what we’re going to do, aren’t we? You won’t consider it, will you?’<br /><br />‘I’m nowhere near the end of my career,’ I replied. ‘I still want to win titles with Arsenal. I don’t want to play in China no matter how much they’re willing to pay. No way’. And so the matter was settled. In the knowledge, by the way, that Chinese president Xi Jinping is a fan. On one occasion Arsenal’s managing director came to tell us that the president had contacted the club asking for my jersey with a dedication. In fact, he wanted a Germany shirt and we promised to sort it out. That same day a courier picked up the shirt from my house.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil says Some people look at my body language and think I don’t care, but that’s me]</b> I simply love to live here. London is a world city. There is so much you can do. There are many different cultures here and I just feel very, very comfortable. The club is huge and I enjoy playing for Arsenal. Living in London is awesome.<br /><br />I like the people <b>[in Likya Ocakbasi Restaurant]</b>. They are part of my family now. And, of course, the Turkish food. It is very similar to what my mother always cooks. That’s why I like being here, I love these Turkish meals. I am very, very proud I am also Turkish and both of my parents are from Turkey. I was born in Germany and grew up there. By playing football I learned my different cultures and that is an advantage if you grow up as a person. You get a different view on certain things. I am very, very thankful I was able to pick the best from many cultures<br /><br />I was never a guy who liked to be in the centre of attention. Sure, today people recognise me everywhere. But I always simply wanted to be with my people. It was like that in school, too. I just went there and tried to do my best. But in the back of my head there was always football. That was my life and my love. On the pitch I always want to be successful and do everything perfectly. That’s how I flourish and my attitude changes. I simply love to play<br /><br />I was always a calm guy. I know what I am capable of and I don’t let myself get unsettled by other people. During my childhood and my career there were always people who liked me and people who disliked me. I know pretty well who I am and who supports me. Of course fame is a factor when you play for the biggest clubs in the biggest leagues in the world. You have only a little privacy. Still, I am trying to spend as much time as I can with my family and friends, and try to enjoy my life the way I want to<br /><br />Indeed I did not notice many pitches in London that can be compared to the Affenkäfig. Still, there are similar pitches here, too - but with lawn or artificial grass<br /><br />Where I started, the surroundings were not easy. The floor was cement and, if you fell, you immediately started bleeding. But it helped. Especially, because I always played against older boys on that very little space. You need to be skilled for that. For my development this was precious<br /><br />Many young players or their parents come to me. No matter where I am, they ask me how it was with me. And that’s a message I want to convey in my book: The most important thing when you are a kid is to have fun. If you are talented and you have a little luck, you will march your own way and nobody can stop you. You need to work on yourself, have self-belief and have fun. Then, you can make your dream come true<br /><br />Fresh, young players just keep coming through. In Germany there was a big focus on working with young players and talents were given the chance to establish themselves in the first teams. I wished it would be like that with English clubs, too. Sure, the clubs here have so much money due to the TV deals and can buy almost every player. But if you look at the Bundesliga and our national team you can see it is possible to be successful when you trust your own talents<br /><br />I have played for a few clubs, but to have my own song, like that one in Tokyo, is a unique thing for me. When I heard it for the first time I had goose bumps and I still get them. You just are really thankful for that amazing support<br /><br />I’m proud of quite a few of my goals but that one against Ludogorets was like on PES! Passing three or four opponents and then scoring. When I watch it, I think it was the best goal of my career<br /><br />Some people like me, some people don’t. Some people look at my body language and think I don’t care. But that’s me. I won’t change my body language or my style of play drastically anymore<br /><br />Expectations on me were very high everywhere <b>[I have been]</b>, because I am a player who can make the difference. You have to deal with that. There will always be criticism and there will always be praise. But what matters is what the manager tells me. I have said that numerous times. But what I can’t understand is when people say: ‘Look, he does not push anymore’ or ‘He does not run enough’. If you look at my numbers you can see I run a lot and I show a good attitude<br /><br />The disappointment <b>[against Bayern]</b> was very, very big, obviously. Especially as it was 1-1 at half-time. To lose that high during the second half was bitter. Not just for me, but for the whole team. And we knew ahead of the second leg that it would be extremely difficult, especially against such a strong team<br /><br />Of course we had high hopes. In my opinion Bayern was not as strong as they were in the years before. We expected to achieve something. The disappointment was huge, also because I think we have the quality to go far in the competition. Unfortunately it did not happen<br /><br />At the start of my career I thought about it <b>[after you’ve lost a game]</b> a lot and I was angry for a long time. Of course it is still similar if we lose a game. But you should not think too much about what happened, but look ahead. Life goes on and you have successful matches and you have bad matches. You just have to keep going full throttle<br /><br />You can’t compare the expectations at Real with any other club. Neither with Arsenal nor the national team. In Madrid you have to win every match. If you get a draw, even against Barcelona, you failed. Especially as a young player you have to develop accordingly and take on that mentality. Jose Mourinho helped me a lot with that. He supported me and always wanted the best for me. When I look back, there were many nice moments at Real and I made many friends there<br /><br />It does not only depend on the manager. Of course he was the one who convinced me to join Arsenal and he was a main factor for me to come here. He is a very experienced coach who made Arsenal one of the best clubs in the world. You must have respect for him, because he is a great manager. But I do not decide whether the manager stays or not. What’s important for me is that we develop as a team and reach our goals<br /><br />Money never played a big role for me in football. I play football because I love it. Sure, you do not earn peanuts and the offer from China was tempting and interesting. But as I said: Money is not everything. I want to win titles and I have my goals I want to achieve. That is more important than money. That’s why I said from the beginning, that China is not an option for me<br /><br />Many people ask me that question <b>[about Fenerbahce]</b>, my family, my friends. When they hear something like that they keep telling me: ‘Join that club’ or ‘Go there!’, but at the moment I have a contract at Arsenal and I do not think about Turkey or other leagues. You can never know what is going to happen in the future. I feel very, very comfortable here. We’ll see about the rest<br /><br />I became a professional when I was 16 years old. Many people came to me pretending to be my ‘best friend’ and only wanting the best for me. With me everybody is welcome but it is normal that over the years you have only those people close to you that you can trust 100 per cent. Sometimes they see things that I do not notice. I am happy that it is like this. That I have my friends I grew up with and my family. They support me, no matter if I am a successful football player or not. They love me because I am Mesut and I am proud of that. Many other football players have few real friends<br /><br />I like to spend time at home with my friends and family, especially my dog and my cousin. My friends and my family visit me regularly for longer intervals. We go out to dinner or to the cinema. If we have a few days off I fly somewhere, mostly into the sun. But, apart from that, I am usually at home<br /><br />I always want to control the game, give assists and help my team. It was like that with me from the start. In my position you have many possibilities playing forward: You can demand the balls, make telling passes or score yourself. I feel the most comfortable playing as a number 10 because I’ve done it since I was young<br /><br />Of course that makes me proud and it is an honour <b>[to be compared with Bergkamp]</b>. Bergkamp is a living legend at Arsenal and he was an amazing football player. But I do not want to compare myself with anybody. I have my own style and I’ve had it since I was a kid. I am proud of these comparisons, but I am Mesut Ozil</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil has released a statement explaining his meeting with controversial Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan]</b> The past couple of weeks have given me time to reflect, and time to think over the events of the last few months. Consequently, I want to share my thoughts and feelings about what has happened. Like many people, my ancestry traces back to more than one country. Whilst I grew up in Germany, my family background has its roots firmly based in Turkey. I have two hears, one German and one Turkish. During my childhood, my mother taught me always to be respectful and to never forget where I came from, and these are still values that I think about to this day.<br /><br />In may, I met President Erdogan in London, during a charitable and educational event. We first met in 2010 after he and Angela Merkel watched the Germany vs Turkey match together in Berlin. Since then, out paths have crossed a lot of times around the globe. I’m aware that the picture of us caused a huge response in the German media, and whilst some people may accuse me of lying or being deceitful, the picture we took had no political intentions. As I said, my mother has never let me lose sight of my ancestry, heritage and family traditions.<br /><br />For me, having a picture with President Erdogan wasn’t about politics or elections, it was about me respecting the highest office of my family’s country. My job is a football player and not a politician, and out meeting was not an endorsement of any policies. In fact, we spoke about the same topic that we do every time we have met - football - as he too was a player in his youth.<br /><br />Although the German media have portrayed something different, the truth is that not meeting with the President would have been disrespecting the roots of my ancestors, who I know would be proud of where I am today. For me, it didn’t matter who was President, it mattered that it was the President. Having respect for political office is a view I’m sure both the Queen and Prime Minister Theresa May share when they too hosted Erdogan in London. Whether it had been the Turkish or German president, my actions would’ve been no different. I get that this might be hard to understand, as in most cultures the political leader cannot be thought of as being separate from the person. But in this case, it is different</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil has released a second statement in response to the criticism both he and Ilkay Gundogan received in the wake of meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan]</b> I know that I am a footballer who has played in arguably the three toughest leagues in the world. I’ve been fortunate to receive great support from my teammates and coaching staff while playing in the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League. And in addition, throughout my career, I’ve learnt to deal with the media.<br /><br />A lot of people talk about my performances - many applaud and many criticise. If a newspaper or pundit finds fault in a game I play in, then I can accept this - I’m not a perfect footballer and this often motivates me to work and train harder. But what I can’t accept are German media outlets repeatedly blaming my dual-heritage and a simple picture for a bad World Cup on behalf of an entire squad.<br /><br />Certain German newspapers are using my background and photo with President Erdogan as right-wing propaganda to further their political cause. Why else did they use pictures and headlines with my name as a direct explanation for defeat in Russia? They didn’t criticise my performances, they didn’t criticise the team’s performances, they just criticised my Turkish ancestry and respect for my upbringing. This crosses a personal line that should never be crossed, as newspapers try to turn the nation of Germany against me.<br /><br />What I also find disappointing are the double standards that the media has. Lothar Matthaus <b>[an honorary German national team captain]</b> met with another world leader a few days back, and received almost no media criticism. Despite his role with the DFB <b>[German national team]</b>, they have not asked him to publicly explain his actions and he continues to represent the players of Germany without any reprimand. If the media felt that I should have been left out of the World Cup squad, then surely he should be stripped of his honorary captaincy? Does my Turkish heritage make me a more worthy target?<br /><br />I’ve always thought that a ‘partnership’ infers support, both in the good times and also during tougher situations. Recently, I planned to visit my former school in Berger-Feld in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, along with two of my charitable partners. I funded a project for one year where immigrant children, children from poor families and any other children can play football together and learn social rules for life. However, days before we were schedule to go, I was abandoned by my so-called ‘partners’, who no longer wanted to work with me at this time. To add to this, the school told my management that they no longer wanted me to be there at this time, as they ‘feared the media’ due to my picture with President Erdogan, especially with the ‘right-wing party in Gelsenkirchen on the rise’. In all honesty, this really hurt. Despite being a student of their back when I was younger, I was made to feel unworthy of their time.<br /><br />In addition to this, I was renounced by another partner. As they are also a sponsor of the DFB, I was asked to take part in promotional videos for the World Cup. Yet after my picture with President Erdogan, they took me out of the campaigns and cancelled all promotional activities that were scheduled. For them, it was no longer good to be seen with me and called the situation ‘crisis management’. This is all ironic because a German Ministry declared their products to have illegal and unauthorized software devices in them, which puts customers at risk. Hundreds of thousands of their products are getting recalled. Whilst I was being criticised and asked to justify my actions by the DFB, there was no such official and public explanation demanded of the DFB sponsor. Why? Am I right in thinking this is worse than a picture with the President of my family’s country? What does the DFB have to say about all this?<br /><br />As I said before, ‘partners’ should stick with you in all situations. Adidas, Beats and BigShoe have been extremely loyal and amazing to work with in this time. They rise above the nonsense created by the German press and media, and we carry out our projects in a professional manner that I really enjoy being part of. During the World Cup, I worked with BigShoe and helped get 23 young children life-changing surgeries in Russia, which I have also done previously in Brazil and Africa. This for me is the most important thing that I do as a football player, yet the newspapers find no space to raise awareness about this sort of thing. For them, me being booed or taking a picture with a President is more significant than helping children get surgeries worldwide.<br /><br />They too have a platform to raise awareness and funds, but choose not to do so.</p>

I have to perhaps produce some more assists but it is going well. As a player, I want to win titles and I hope we can reach that with the team because we have the potential.

I was happy to meet him while at Madrid - he was always my idol and I still watch clips of him sometimes before games and how he used to play</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil to say that he merely laughs off the former Liverpool star and manager’s critiques]</b> I don’t listen to these people - I just listen to my coach and my people who say things straight to my face. So of course, if I play bad, I know that just as I know when I play well. The most important thing is that the coach can help me - if I make mistakes he can tell me, we can speak and I can improve for the future. But if people just say bad things about me because they want to be in the newspaper - I know that and I don’t care about them.</p>

I know people expect me to offer more, dictate play and make the difference - I do, too - but it’s not that straightforward.<br /><br />I’m not the only player in the team and, don’t forget, some of our opponents are simply better than us. Also, what is a ‘big’ or ‘small’ game? In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, anyone can beat anyone. Look at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> beating <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, or <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> beating Man United. So you can’t say my good performances only came in ‘small’ games because these games don’t really exist. The intensity is there in every match and often the ‘small’ teams raise their standard against the ‘big’ teams<br /><br />I also get really frustrated when I miss a game through illness and people question if it is genuine. Yes, it happened a few times - usually in the winter - but what am I supposed to do? If you knew me, you would know it takes a lot for me to miss a game and I have never used sickness as an excuse. Actually the opposite. I played many games when I was ill or had injuries.<br /><br />Before the Champions League game against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> <b>[in March 2017]</b>, I was sick and Arsene <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> told me I was not in the squad because of that. The next morning, the guys from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> called me and said, ‘Listen, you have to come to the stadium, you have to be in the squad’. Despite my illness, I joined the squad and played the last 20 minutes. Most players don’t play when injured or sick - it influences your game, you can’t give everything - but I was always available unless it was impossible</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil vows to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> until 2021]</b> No. I have a contract until the summer of 2021 and I will be staying until then. When I signed the new deal, I thought about it very carefully and said it was one of the most important decisions of my footballing career. I didn’t want to stay for just one or two more years, I wanted to commit my future to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and the club wanted me to do the same. You can go through difficult times, like this, but that is no reason to run away and I’m not going to. I’m here until at least 2021.<br /><br />I said that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> was a big factor in me joining <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> - and he was - but ultimately I signed for the club. Even when Arsene announced he was leaving, I wanted to stay because I love playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and that’s why I’ve been here for six years. When I moved from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, it was a really tough time for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

  <p><b>[Ozil feeling helpless at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but is sure Emery will pick him again]</b> It’s disappointing, of course. But as a professional footballer, I have to respect the decision of the coach. Not being involved, watching from home, makes me feel helpless. I want to be part of the side, I want to support my team-mates to succeed. I’m not training all the time just for the sake of it, I’m ready to play.

  <p><b>[Ozil: People want me to change but I never will]</b> It’s my personality. People want to change me but, since the day I started playing football, I was always like this. If a game is not going well or I play a bad ball, of course I get frustrated because I know it can be better. It’s the same when I come off the pitch looking angry. I’m a perfectionist and sometimes I want too much perfection. It doesn’t take me long to get over - I’m not going around the pitch or sat on the bench pissed off for the next five minutes or anything. It’s just in that moment and then we continue<br /><br />I realise afterwards it’s not good to show this, but it’s instinctive, so I don’t plan it and it’s not easy to change. This is me.

And why, after the World Cup last year, did I return from holiday early for the first time in my career to start training three days before I was expected back? I did it for the new coach, the team and the club. Maybe people don’t like that I have a good contract? I don’t know or care</p>
