  <p><b>[While many leagues struggle to restart amid the coronavirus pandemic, the long-awaited K. League season is set to get underway and Jeonbuk Motors head coach Jose Morais is both curious and excited]</b> Here we have increased confidence about the return to normality and things are stacking up in order, the businesses are re-opening and normal life is returning to our daily routine. It looks good.<br /><br />We are lucky because in South Korea, clubs in the K. League have very good conditions. We have a hotel training centre almost, so we can be together. There was never a total lockdown of places, so there were always recommendations about the way to behave in order to keep ourselves safe and avoiding the possibility to spread the coronavirus. But never orders in terms of not allowing people to travel wherever they wanted. Even in Daegu, where we had more coronavirus cases, there was never a lockdown of the city in terms of no one from here is going anywhere. So, the people here were very cautious about the need to follow certain rules in order for the virus not to spread and for us to keep safe. Using masks, not a problem at all about social distancing. I think the behaviour was extraordinary in terms of creating good possibilities for the people to feel safe. We, as football players and as a group, and the conditions we had, allowed us to more or less be in a safe environment because the facilities were closed to the fans and public. During the whole week, we were training. We kept on going with our preparation and waiting for the situation to become normal and for the league to start. For the two weeks, we were more confident at the training ground. Players didn’t go out too much, we stayed here. After the first two weeks, players were allowed to go home for one or two days but just to go home to their families and come back. Fortunately, we never had any coronavirus cases among us and not even among the families of the players or any other staff. We can say that we were happy and we did our life not normal, but in terms of being prepared, we were very lucky to have the possibility to be together at this training centre. The people here in the kitchen, maintenance, they made our lives really easy to live.<br /><br />The first thought is you need to take as much points as you can from the beginning. But it will be shorter for others also, so less games, means less opportunity to recover points. It means if you win a good advantage at the beginning, it can be enough for you to take advantage and secure the league in a better way. It also means the league will be tighter and if you don’t win games in the beginning, it can be difficult to recover for teams losing. It’s 11 games less and 11 games less means 33 points. It’s a different scenario for sure. We have to be prepared and mentally tough<br /><br />There’s no other pressure than the normal pressure. The responsibility of showing quality exists but it’s the quality we have, so we can’t show what we don’t have. We have good quality, so we should be happy to show what we have and play in a way that we will achieve our goals. It’s obviously much more than just being worried about what we’re showing to the people. I think the world will be interested to understand in what way they can go further after the pandemic. All the eyes in terms of trying to understand the kind of measures we need to adopt in order to keep the security and safety of all involved. I believe that there is no precedence. We don’t know what will happen. We will do things that no one has done before. We will start the league in conditions that no one has before. We’ll wear masks on the bench and off to avoid the spread of the virus. The players will play without masks, so what will happen? No one is infected, so we hope that no one else will be infected in this case. We will play without supporters in the stadium, how will the broadcast be? The show will be the same. What kind of feeling will the people have in front of the TV? How they will broadcast in terms of giving a feeling that will please the people at home? There’s a lot of interesting things. I’m also curious but I’m excited about what will happen, hoping the result will be positive, and everybody will be healthy and happy to watch football at home</p>

  <p><b>[Former assistant Jose Morais says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> never lets a player down]</b> His focus is on his team, not on rumours. Rumours will always exist and he can even joke about rumours. But his concern is about how his team can perform in terms of achieving the goals they can achieve and what contribution the player can give to the goal. He will make sure the contribution the player can give is not affected with the rumours existing outside. Probably he will have an approach to the player that will make the player focused on the task while he is there. This is the way he works. He is understanding and a warm coach. He understands that every individual in a certain moment in life has his goals. For sure, he will know about what <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> wants for his future and he will be as supportive as he can to help him achieve what he wants. This is what every player coached by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> that left the club has to say, he is a special coach. He never lets a player down. He is honest in his feelings. This is a great quality. He will not fake what he is. He is what he is. Everyone knows what he is. Also, he is a coach to understand the reality of every individual<br /><br />It’s fantastic to work with someone like him. For me, he has skills and qualities that are special in my point of view. Leadership and management, he is an example for any other manager. The influence that he can have on players in creating an impact, make them champions, is fantastic. He does it in a very particular, simple way. He has character, charisma, a lot of knowledge about how to coach players with different kinds of ideas. He is capable of putting them together to make a strong team and create a winning mentality. This is what makes a manager special.<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham were emphatically knocked out of the Champions League by <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> in the last 16 in March]</b> People have feelings about things they’re seeing and they make comments. This is his way to win. He knows so much about football. He was experiencing so many situations that he can create the football that suits the needs of the club and team in a certain moment. If the team will be able to play the football he really wants, I think people will be pleased with this football. In certain moments, what is important for him is to be pragmatic and to win the game. He was always someone that wanted players to be positive. He always gave them a free role to take decisions and be creative. He also thinks it’s important to have the responsibility that whatever you’re doing in the game, there’s only one objective, that’s to win the game. This is the reason why he is one of the most successful coaches in the world. He wins games and competitions. If you want a coach to win competitions, he is one of these coaches. It’s difficult to compare with because he wins<br /><br /><b>[Lampard returned to the Bridge at the start of the season and despite an inconsistent run of form and a transfer ban, the former midfielder had <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> occupying the fourth and final Champions League spot at the time of postponement]</b> I always thought that him and <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> are future managers in England. They have the quality, charisma and quality. They have the interest in the game that put them in the path of managing clubs and players. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is a special guy, he has a special heart and feeling. Not only for the club, but as a human being, he is a great guy and fantastic person. I’m really happy to see him succeed. I believe that he will continue to have success and great future as a manager. I know the academy and it’s full of fantastic young players. Some of them went out loan and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> didn’t have space for them to progress inside the club. But there is a new generation of players who are now having an opportunity and today, the circumstances exist in order for the club to really use their own products. It’s an opportunity for these young players to create an impact. I think that in one or two seasons, we will see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> champions again with all these fantastic players</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Morais says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> can emulate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> a ‘good option’ to replace Benzema]</b> I think <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is definitely one of the players that can be a target for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> because he is still young and his quality, talent and strength is capable to project him into one of the best players in the world. This is the perspective Madrid wants and this is what you need as a player in order to attract the interest of Madrid. I definitely agree that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is a player that in the future could play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I’m not there now and I have no idea if it will be a reality, but Madrid is definitely a club that every good player in the world would like to play for. I believe <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> would be pleased to go to Madrid<br /><br />I think <b>[Haaland]</b> is a great player. He’s also one of the young players with very great quality. His finishing qualities are unbelievable. Doing what he did in this short period for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and creating the impact that he created. I think that it is never too soon for a quality player to go to a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. The higher the quality of player, the more the possibilities to succeed exist in a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. You have a lot of competition in the club because you only have good players there, high-level players. <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> is a fantastic player, a goalscorer, he has the quality that he has playing for Madrid all these years. I think <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is definitely a good option to replace a striker like him. Probably in the style of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> would also be a player that could have some similarities in the strength and speed, and capacity of playing</p>
