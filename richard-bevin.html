  <p><b>[LMA chief: <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players must all be tested for coronavirus before play can resume]</b> Our managers do not want to be back on the pitch unless the players have been tested. But at the same time the government must confirm that is OK, because the tests must be made available first - if there’s a shortage - to care workers, patients, NHS staff and their families<br /><br />In Germany, if you look at discussions about coming back in May, that’s probably a direct result of some very clear thinking from their government because they’re doing 50,000 tests a day. In this country we’re doing 10,000 per day, although the government are targeting 100,000 each day by the end of the month<br /><br /><b>[Bevan has suggested that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> sides should not be using public funds at this time]</b> Maybe the learning for the government is that when the furlough period comes to an end and they need to reset it for June, I would welcome them saying furloughing is only really focused on the people that really need it. Maybe we should be seeing the clubs in League One and League Two that need the furloughing. I’d like to see the government setting better guidelines so that the wrong businesses don’t take away the money from where we need it to be</p>

In this country (England) we’re doing 10,000 per day</p>
