  <p><b>[Sydney FC winger Filip Holosko is confident he will surpass his goals and assists tallies from last season]</b> If you’re winning and you are undefeated your confidence is higher than last season but last season I scored 10 goals and I believe this season I will score maybe the same number of goals or maybe more. We have still nine games to go <b>[before the finals]</b>.<br /><br />I had two chances. One in the first half and in the second half, I think, a big opportunity for me to score with my head but I didn’t score. Still 0-0 is still undefeated and we are happy and we are looking forward to play against Wellington<br /><br />I think Bobo is a great player. He does a very good job for the team. He’s scored now seven goals and I am sure he will score more goals <b>[this season]</b>. I have a good connection with him, he’s a very good striker in the box and very good with the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s quest to keep their A-League double-winning squad together has suffered a blow with former marquee Filip Holosko deciding to return to Europe]</b> Winning the championship and the Premier’s Plate was an incredibly special moment for me and my family. This is a hugely professional and family club and I will never forget that. I wish Sydney FC all the best for the future.</p>
