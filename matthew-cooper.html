They have endured their worst start to a league campaign and have been severely lacking goals.

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> has fallen victim to the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> axe just 18 months after replacing <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> in the Emirates hot-seat. <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> has been placed in temporary charge while the club search for a permanent successor, with the likes of <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>, <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> and <a href="nuno-espirito-santo.html">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> being tipped to take the reins. But were they right to sack Emery?<br /><br /><b>[Ollie Salt said]</b> i <a href="unai-emery.html">Emery</a> cannot have too many complaints after picking up just one win in his last nine games as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> boss. The Spaniard’s position had become completely untenable, while he almost committed a sackable offence last night alone by leaving <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> and <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> on the bench in their 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Yet the Gunners’ problems run far deeper than Emery. Aside from bringing in <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, their recruitment strategy has been poorly devised for too long now and the board have a lot to answer for. Not only do they need to find a suitable replacement, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> also need to make serious changes in the boardroom if that man is to be a success.<br /><br /><b>[Mark Taylor said]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were given no choice but to give <a href="unai-emery.html">Emery</a> the boot, and you’ll have to search far and wide to find a Gunners fan who would say otherwise. The worst start to a season in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history, losing control of his captain and constantly being mocked by supporters - it was a sorry state of affairs for the Spaniard in the end. It’s going to take something special to put <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> back on the map now … <br /><br /><b>[Alex Wood said]</b> Sacking managers with reckless abandon isn’t the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> way. <a href="unai-emery.html">Emery</a> was sinking - but he deserved until at least Christmas to turn things around. Let’s not forget that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are still below the Gunners in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> table. The beleaguered Spaniard also managed 22 games in a row without a defeat last season. Any new manager is still going to be left with a squad that’s unbalanced and lacking any discernible quality in defence<br /><br /><b>[Warren Muggleton said]</b> In football, pressure builds from the bottom up - now, the top has blown for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Emery. Anyone who has seen popular fan show AFTV will know the Gunners faithful have been disgruntled for most of 2019. While a poor showing against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the Europa League final in May was a sign of poor form to come. It has led to them sitting eighth in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, eight points off a Champions League return. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> want to get back into the elite - and the man with three Europa League titles to his name has shown, in 18 months, he is not up to the job<br /><br /><b>[Matthew Cooper said]</b> Unfortunately <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s position at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had simply become untenable. The club are currently in the midst of their longest winless run since 1992 and his poor handling of the <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> situations gave the board no choice. However, it is the next appointment which will be the most important, with the club desperately chasing Champions League football. Currently eight points off the top four, whoever gets the job has a monumental task on their hands</p>
