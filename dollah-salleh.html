  <p><b>[Pahang head coach Dollah Salleh’s return to Kuantan after a horrible spell with the national team could not have been better]</b> Still to early to say that we already have our best eleven. There is still a long journey ahead and what’s important is for us to be consistent.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh, head coach of Pahang has expressed his dissapointment towards his team despite their 1-0 win over Sarawak]</b> Thankfully we scored early and got the three points. But after that, we were at lost. I know the quality of my players and that’s not how they usually play on the field. The team did not sustain good discipline throughout the 90 minutes and I’m not very satisfied with that. We scored early and I expect we could score two or three more but they lost their focus after they scored that goal.<br /><br />In the final minutes of the game, we have to focus on defending as Sarawak were really attacking us back to back. With our team were in haywire, the lack of focus at the back could have cost us the game. They also have the home crowd which disrupted us</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh was left disappointed that his team just didn’t turn up in the away clash against Kedah]</b> Of course it’s disappointing. Everything didn’t go our way tonight. We had trouble with our focus and that surprised me. The players had trouble executing my plans. We got stuck in the middle and that meant our strikers didn’t get the service they needed. I’m not sure yet <b>[on making changes]</b>. It’s possible that I could maintain the same team but we’ll look at it over the next few days.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh wants team to continue momentum after a dominating display against Penang]</b> In the first half we can see that we played really well in the first 20 minutes. But after we scored two goals, we were a bit complacent, and Penang got one back during that time. However, I told my players if we scored the third goal, we can go on and win the game and we can see that we scored six in the end.<br /><br />Dont take this victory as a guaranteed success for our upcoming games. This will definitely boost our confidence and I believe with this win, I hope we can continue this winning momentum when we face Melaka United next</p>

  <p><b>[Coming fresh from their 6-1 trashing of Pulau Pinang, Dollah Salleh said his midfielders need to continue their fine form]</b> I hope they <b>[the midfielders]</b> can play as well as they did against Pulau Pinang when we play away from home. I believe the players can do it with a good understandings among them.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah wants Pahang to keep momentum against PKNS]</b> I am satisfied, today was the best performance that my men produced. The only hitch was in the final few minutes, when a number of injuries meant I had to make a few changes including the goalkeeper, and that disrupted the tempo somewhat and Melaka took advantage of it. What’s important is we play <b>[against PKNS]</b> like we did today. And I believe that is not impossible</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh is not happy with the match officials after their defeat to JDT]</b> I think we only started playing football only in the second half. We defended more and only waited for JDT to come and attack us in the first half. However, things changed in the second half. We started to attack them more but we were unfortunate not to convert our chances. But overall, I’m not happy with the referees. I think they are very poor with their decision making tonight.<br /><br />We know JDT are the best team in the country and I believe we will follow their footsteps and we will challenge them until the end of the season. I think we have to go back to the drawing board and work more on our tactical. Second half we were better than team, we throw everything we have at them and we were unlucky not to get the <b>[equalising]</b> goal. The way I see it, we were a bit sloppy and disappointing but at the same time I think second half, it was a pretty even game</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang boss Dollah Salleh was not impressed with his men’s performance against rivals JDT]</b> We are not safe yet. There’s much left to be done in the second leg. Truthfully tonight we did not play well enough, and JDT dominated the game. The only thing deciding the match was the fact that we were more clinical with our chances.<br /><br />Our fans’ support gave the team the edge and the motivation to fulfill what I needed from them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh admitted that JDT were the better team]</b> To be honest we did not play really well. JDT were the better team in the first 30 minutes but in the second half we were very disciplined with our defending and attacking. We didn’t create as many chances, and Soumareh’s goal was our only chance of the night and thankfully we scored from that.</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang boss Dollah Salleh also shared Sumareh’s bewilderment]</b> When found out about this, I was shocked. I still do not understand why Sumareh was given the suspension as the video <b>[recording]</b> clearly shows that Sumareh did not attack anybody, instead he’s the one who was beaten.</p>

  <p><b>[Negeri look to home advantage to overturn first leg deficit against Pahang]</b> All the players want to be there in Paroi. They are serious in training and have been fighting for their places. I’m having a headache trying to name the final 18 because everyone is available and that makes it difficult for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh reserve special praise for his players and believes that they can win the final]</b> Pahang is a new team, only 5 months I’m here. We are still not consistent yet but I believe with the players that we have, we can do something tomorrow.<br /><br />Why not <b>[win the final]</b>? We have many youngsters but individually we have players who can play high level of football. These players are mentally strong and I’m sure we can give a good performance<br /><br /><b>[On Yamil Romero]</b> He’s ok. He’s here almost two weeks with us. He’s got the skills, he’s very talented. The only thing is his match fitness but based on his experience of high level football, maybe he can do something tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang showed plenty of heart in the manner that they came back into the match in the FA Cup final against Kedah]</b> Not maybe….It was a mistake early in the game. I cannot do anything but we put that to one side. Actually we already briefed him in training. We know his character so we told him that if there’s any challenge, don’t get involved. Even before start game, we said the same to him. But this is football and it’s a lesson for him. We were planning for him to follow Liridon <b>[Krasniqi]</b>.<br /><br />Even though we played with only 10, we never gave up. As a coach, I’m proud of my players in the second half. Just that the result wasn’t with us. In the second half, we didn’t even feel like we were playing with 10. I just reminded them to be discipline and for them to support both defence and attack. That was is our real game. If we can maintain this, I’m sure we can catch up<br /><br /><b>[On Yamil Romero]</b> He struggled on match fitness actually but second half he did superb. When he gets match fitness, I think he can be one of the best players</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang boss Dollah Salleh was elated with the performance shown by his men, in their 2-0 Super League match win against Selangor]</b> In overall, this is Pahang’s true performance. Our form had dropped in the past few matches, but it had picked up again tonight, and it fact it had begun in the second half of the final. The boys were very disciplined, they supported the attack and when defending, and I’m not surprised we’ve come away with a 2-0 victory. We could have scored more but we missed a number of chances, but the three points are very important. Now we can head into the mid-season break relieved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pahang will push for success on two fronts after the break]</b> Why should we say no to the Malaysia Cup when we still have a chance in the league? And why should we give up the league campaign just to chase after the Malaysia Cup title? All the competing teams are on the same level, and those qualifying for the quarter-finals <b>[of the cup]</b> will likely be the top teams in the league as well.<br /><br />We have to accept it <b>[possible fixture congestion]</b>. When the schedule is too tight, I have to handle matters such as player recovery and such well<br /><br />We’ll take a one-week break, and return to training most probably on Thursday evening <b>[next week]</b>. The league will resume just four or five days after Aidilfitri, after all</p>

  <p><b>[Felda struck late to earn all 3 points against Pahang which left Dollah Salleh bitterly upset over the standard of refereeing]</b> I don’t mind losing but the standard of refereeing tonight <b>[Saturday]</b> was disappointing, as if the match was arranged. It’s not only the penalty but also many other decisions by the officials that favoured Felda United when it shouldn’t have.<br /><br />They got the penalty but in the situation when it should have been us getting one, it wasn’t given. Pahang have faced this many times but we remained patience and kept quiet but this time for the football in this country, I will not</p>
