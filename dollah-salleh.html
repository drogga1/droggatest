  <p><b>[Pahang head coach Dollah Salleh’s return to Kuantan after a horrible spell with the national team could not have been better]</b> Still to early to say that we already have our best eleven. There is still a long journey ahead and what’s important is for us to be consistent.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh, head coach of Pahang has expressed his dissapointment towards his team despite their 1-0 win over Sarawak]</b> Thankfully we scored early and got the three points. But after that, we were at lost. I know the quality of my players and that’s not how they usually play on the field. The team did not sustain good discipline throughout the 90 minutes and I’m not very satisfied with that. We scored early and I expect we could score two or three more but they lost their focus after they scored that goal.<br /><br />In the final minutes of the game, we have to focus on defending as Sarawak were really attacking us back to back. With our team were in haywire, the lack of focus at the back could have cost us the game. They also have the home crowd which disrupted us</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh was left disappointed that his team just didn’t turn up in the away clash against Kedah]</b> Of course it’s disappointing. Everything didn’t go our way tonight. We had trouble with our focus and that surprised me. The players had trouble executing my plans. We got stuck in the middle and that meant our strikers didn’t get the service they needed. I’m not sure yet <b>[on making changes]</b>. It’s possible that I could maintain the same team but we’ll look at it over the next few days.</p>

  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh wants team to continue momentum after a dominating display against Penang]</b> In the first half we can see that we played really well in the first 20 minutes. But after we scored two goals, we were a bit complacent, and Penang got one back during that time. However, I told my players if we scored the third goal, we can go on and win the game and we can see that we scored six in the end.<br /><br />Dont take this victory as a guaranteed success for our upcoming games. This will definitely boost our confidence and I believe with this win, I hope we can continue this winning momentum when we face Melaka United next</p>

  <p><b>[Coming fresh from their 6-1 trashing of Pulau Pinang, Dollah Salleh said his midfielders need to continue their fine form]</b> I hope they <b>[the midfielders]</b> can play as well as they did against Pulau Pinang when we play away from home. I believe the players can do it with a good understandings among them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dollah wants Pahang to keep momentum against PKNS]</b> I am satisfied, today was the best performance that my men produced. The only hitch was in the final few minutes, when a number of injuries meant I had to make a few changes including the goalkeeper, and that disrupted the tempo somewhat and Melaka took advantage of it. What’s important is we play <b>[against PKNS]</b> like we did today. And I believe that is not impossible</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh is not happy with the match officials after their defeat to JDT]</b> I think we only started playing football only in the second half. We defended more and only waited for JDT to come and attack us in the first half. However, things changed in the second half. We started to attack them more but we were unfortunate not to convert our chances. But overall, I’m not happy with the referees. I think they are very poor with their decision making tonight.<br /><br />We know JDT are the best team in the country and I believe we will follow their footsteps and we will challenge them until the end of the season. I think we have to go back to the drawing board and work more on our tactical. Second half we were better than team, we throw everything we have at them and we were unlucky not to get the <b>[equalising]</b> goal. The way I see it, we were a bit sloppy and disappointing but at the same time I think second half, it was a pretty even game</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pahang boss Dollah Salleh was not impressed with his men’s performance against rivals JDT]</b> We are not safe yet. There’s much left to be done in the second leg. Truthfully tonight we did not play well enough, and JDT dominated the game. The only thing deciding the match was the fact that we were more clinical with our chances.<br /><br />Our fans’ support gave the team the edge and the motivation to fulfill what I needed from them</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2017-04-24-retrieve">2017 04 24 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dollah Salleh admitted that JDT were the better team]</b> To be honest we did not play really well. JDT were the better team in the first 30 minutes but in the second half we were very disciplined with our defending and attacking. We didn’t create as many chances, and Soumareh’s goal was our only chance of the night and thankfully we scored from that.</p>
