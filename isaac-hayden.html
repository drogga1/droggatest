  <p><b>[Newcastle United midfielder Isaac Hayden says that he expects to leave the club this summer]</b> I think I will be going. I have spoken to the club about it and they’ve been open and honest with me. I’m pretty sure this will be my last game at home. In football, you never know, so I can’t say for definite, although it’s looking like <b>[the Liverpool defeat was]</b> my last game here. Nothing has changed <b>[from a personal perspective]</b>. It’s not what is best for me or my family to be playing here next season and to be doing the travelling I have done this season. It’s unfortunate but the club know my stance, and have known it for a year now. There are no excuses going into the summer. It’s about getting the deal right for the club and for myself<br /><br />It’s a fantastic club. You wouldn’t want to actively try to leave a club when you have 52,000 every home game. But, for me, I have a daughter and a fiancee, soon to be wife, who I have to put first. To me, they are more important than football will ever be</p>

  <p><b>[Isaac Hayden: <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> takeover frustration ‘pointless’ as club awaits <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> decision]</b> I can’t speak for the other lads but I think the performances when we switched to a back-four before the lockdown and obviously the performances since we’ve been back - I don’t think anyone’s been affected that I can see. We’ve had a good performance against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, a second-game syndrome, leggy performance against Villa - but still got a half-decent result - and then we’re playing arguably one of the best sides in Europe. The lads have been training well, we’ve been in good spirits. The manager and the staff have been in good spirits. I think it’s just a case that it’s out of our hands, we can’t really influence anything so there’s no point getting frustrated about it. We’ve just got to do our job which is to win football matches for Newcastle</p>
