  <p><b>[Barcelona vice president Jordi Mestre has resigned amid reports he is unhappy about the apparently imminent dismissal of sporting director Pep Segura]</b> Jordi Mestre, until today the vice president responsible for sports at the club, presented his irrevocable resignation this afternoon.

  <p><b>[Sandro Rosell believes he never would have gone to prison were it not for his position as president of Barcelona]</b> If I had not been <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> president, I would not have gone to prison, of that I have no doubt at all. I don’t think that anybody would have investigated me as a business, nobody would have spied on me, nor would there have been such aggressive fiscal persecution that I still face. <b>[There have been]</b> 72 acts from the tax office since I was chosen to be president of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Before being president, <b>[there were]</b> zero financial inspections. Is that a coincidence?</p>
