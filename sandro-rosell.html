  <p><b>[Sandro Rosell’s lawyer, Pau Molins, rejected the claims relating to Abidal’s transplant]</b> It suits them to paint Sandro Rosell as a beast. We don’t know anything about this report, but it annoys me that it is coming out one year after he has been imprisoned and as he waits for trial. The conversation that has come out has absolutely nothing to do with the <b>[other]</b> case. I think they don’t want to go to trial so they are bringing out things to see how to buy time and how to hide, because they don’t know what to do with Rosell in prison.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have denied that the club’s former president Sandro Rosell bought a liver illegally in order to allow former defender Eric Abidal to undergo a transplant]</b> Given the information published today in relation to the transplant to which the current technical secretary of the first football team Eric Abidal was subjected, FC Barcelona categorically denies any irregular in the matter, as has already been done by the interested party and those responsible for the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona. The information disseminated omits an important fact such as the file of this case was closed by a court in Barcelona, ​​dated on April 18. This omission has caused damage to the reputation of Eric Abidal, all of the organisations involved in the transplant procedures, of FC Barcelona, and former president Sandro Rosell. The club deeply regrets the lack of rigor in the dissemination of information related to such a sensitive topic, and reaffirms its commitment to Eric Abidal and his foundation, to help improve the lives of children and young people affected by similar medical treatments.</p>

I don’t think that anybody would have investigated me as a business, nobody would have spied on me, nor would there have been such aggressive fiscal persecution that I still face. <b>[There have been]</b> 72 acts from the tax office since I was chosen to be president of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>.
