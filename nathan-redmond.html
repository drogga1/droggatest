  <p><b>[Nathan Redmond, who will be harbouring ambitions of forcing his way into England’s Euro 2020 plans, has signed a new four-year contract at Southampton]</b> I’m really happy to have signed, and I’m just wanting to get the season up and going now. We’ve got a great group of players here, who I’ve been with for the last three years. I see them every single day and it’s a pleasure to go out there and perform with them at the weekend and train hard with them every single week. I feel like we can hopefully build something special and to be a part of it for the next four years is good for me<br /><br />I feel I’ve developed a lot as a player, but not just as a player, but as a person as well. It’s been a crucial part and another step in my development. I’ve had ups and I’ve had downs with the club, but it’s been a constant learning process. Looking back, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every single moment. I’m getting older and it’s another stage in my development. I came here as a young lad with a fair amount of games and experience under my belt, but of course there was another level when I came here, which I had to step up to with the players who were here at the time. The players who have come and gone, and the players still here now, I feel like I have grown with them the last couple of years and it’s a good feeling to now know I’m crossing over that border into a more senior player now, and that comes with more responsibility. It’s not always something I’ve wanted in the past, but I think now I’m definitely ready for it</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Redmond talks about a trip he made to Ghana last year]</b> Words could not do justice to say how touching that trip was. Why should me missing a chance in the first five minutes of a game make me go, ‘It’s going to ruin the rest of my weekend?’ Or me having an argument with a team-mate on the training pitch? I don’t have any time for that because life is very short</p>
