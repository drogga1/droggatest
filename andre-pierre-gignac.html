  <p><b>[France’s Andre-Pierre Gignac says he is still haunted by his <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016 final miss]</b> The first week afterwards was very tough. It will haunt me for the rest of my career. I thought of the joy of my team-mates, had I scored that goal in the 92nd minute. It was very difficult. Footballers or former players can understand it</p>

  <p><b>[Despite being located in South America for the last couple of years, Andre-Pierre Gignac watched <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s come-back against <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> and couldn’t hide his feelings regarding the final result, as well as towards the French giants]</b> I just hate <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, I’d rather die than sign for them. Even if <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> offered me ten times more money, I wouldn’t leave. You have no idea how I screamed at the sixth <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> goal in the Champions League - my wife was scared!<br /><br /><b>[Discussing his former coach at Marseille, <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a>, and the French national coach <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a>, he couldn’t avoid mentioning his current boss, Ricardo Ferretti]</b> Ferretti is just as passionate as <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> and <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a>, but ‘Tuca’ <b>[Ferretti]</b> is closer <b>[to us]</b>. He is in contact with the players, he jokes and <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> is not like that, football is everything for him. They have the same passion, but not the same way of working. Ferretti has supported me in my career and has had a lot patience with me. With each coach I learned something: <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a> taught me the winning mentality; <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> the tactical; Ferretti brought everything in harmony and gave me discipline<br /><br /><b>[Talking about the motives behind his decision to join Tigres, the 31-year-old striker highlighted the fact that when he arrived in Mexico he felt like he fell in love with it]</b> I had a good feeling from the beginning. When I discussed the move with the Tigres’ board, I felt something different. I came from a gypsy culture in France, which helped.</p>

  <p><b>[Gignac sends Twitter rant to reporter who made violence allegations]</b> You’re a ***** liar, if I’d hit you you’d still be on the floor of the stadium, believe me. What do you want? To make people mad? Do you want to get famous? More followers on Twitter? You can’t understand a players’ sadness and anger after losing a final? You were behind me, following me, shouting at me like a product, an animal. For what? For ‘my pains’ you told me.<br /><br />What did you want? Insults? A bad reaction? Oh, no. I know. You wanted an exclusive to grow as a journalist. I’m not a product, nobody tells me what I have to do or say, certainly not a journalist. What a shame I didn’t toss the bottle at you! A journalist like you is an embarrassment for the profession. I’m not perfect and I have a lot of flaws, and if I have to leave Mexico because of the press, I’ll go. I’m tired of hearing lies</p>
