  <p><b>[Aaron McLean after leaving role as Peterborough coach says EFL clubs have been given no support]</b> The club have had no choice but to make cuts and I’m sure throughout the lower league there will be more issues going forward. I was hoping that between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, EFL and <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> that a package would be put together to enable us to play out the remainder of the season. But it hasn’t happened, it’s been 12-14 weeks and I am under no illusions clubs are not made of money. They have to generate money somewhere and at the moment because we are unable to get fans through the gates the lower league clubs need help and it hasn’t been forthcoming<br /><br />We were desperate to continue playing and when we saw what was happening with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Championship we were confident the people that have the money would come in and help us out. The main factor was the cost of testing and the un-furloughing of players and staff so we could be able to continue the season. But to my knowledge no package was ever presented and I think we are really going to see the affects it will have on clubs in the coming few weeks</p>
