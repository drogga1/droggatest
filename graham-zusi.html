  <p><b>[Zusi embracing new USA role as latest Arena fullback transformation]</b> I felt pretty good. I kept everything in front of me and felt pretty comfortable. I’m feeling more comfortable every day, developing the relationships with the center backs and the midfielders. I’m enjoying it and I think it’s a fun position. You see a ton of the ball since it’s always coming through the outside backs, you get to see the entire field in front of you.<br /><br />The <b>[first]</b> chat that we had about the position change was a very good one. <b>[Arena]</b> mentioned some of the games he saw me play in the back and he really liked the way I was able to get forward as well. For me it wasn’t an ego hit by any means. I agreed with everything he said. There is a lot of competition in the midfield on this team so any chance I can get to be in with the group obviously I’m going to take it<br /><br />At Sporting, our outside wingers are called on to defend a lot anyway so that part’s not that much different. The challenging part for me is knowing that I’m the last line of defense and picking and choosing the time to get forward. Everyone on the field has one-on-one battles so one-on-one defending isn’t the issue. The thing to learn and work on is the instinctual positioning, where I need to be at all times, when to be aggressive and get the ball. A lot of it is trusting your instincts. We’re at this level for a reason, everybody knows how to defend. Now it’s about just learning as much as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Zusi takes right back evolution to Sporting KC]</b> Talking with Peter, I think in his mind I’ll probably be playing a bit of both. Positions aside, I think my versatility getting up and down the field and providing attack as a defender is what Pete’s looking for.<br /><br />You know that’s just around the corner. For the most part, you have to focus on what’s at hand. Right now that’s club ball. For us to come in here and get a point on the road, that’s a good thing</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The Canadian teenager Bayern beat out Europe’s best to buy]</b> You watch him play and he has the ability to take over a game. You’ve see him do that this year several times already, and then you remember he’s 17 years old. I’ve seen him grow in just half a season. You can see that he’s almost become a leader on that team, which isn’t something you see often from a 17 year old, and that’s what has impressed me the most.</p>
