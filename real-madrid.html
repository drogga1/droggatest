These statements by the mayor are not only out of place but are completely false, because Real Madrid have not questioned at any time the security measures established in the stadium of Balaidos. Real Madrid want to make it very clear that after learning of the possibility of the game being postponed more than 30 hours in advance, three alternatives were proposed to the league.<br /><br />First, to study the possibility of repairing the roof of the damaged stadium; secondly, the possibility of closing the affected tier <b>[of seats]</b>; and third, if the previous two options were not possible, to study the possibility of changing the venue to another nearby stadium. These proposals sought to avoid the fact that the suspension of the game would harm four competitions, due to the domino effect between them, as well as the enormous economic damage for broadcasters around the world that will have repercussions in the next sale of television rights</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid coach <a href="santiago-solari.html">Santiago Solari</a> is keen to put his bittersweet experience in the Santiago Bernabeu hotseat behind him]</b> Resentment against Madrid? That is a private matter. That’s football. It was an honour to serve Real Madrid. I would like to coach in Europe, in a serious project in one of the big leagues. I saw <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last year and how it grew so much. It was a fantastic campaign for the English teams. There are so many different cultures as well - you have Spanish coaches, German coaches, English coaches, coaches from all over the world who have made it grow. The type of football I like is when the team is the protagonist, offensive football, high tempo and aggressive but in order to achieve that you have to defend high, have fast transitions, and of course talent is a big part of that. The statistics in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are amazing and confirm things are changing. Fifteen years ago there were just three games where one team averaged 70 per cent of possession. Three years ago that went up to 30 games. Two years ago it was 60 games and last year there were 67 games in which one team had 70% of possession<br /><br /><b>[<a href="santiago-solari.html">Solari</a>’s compatriot <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> is one Argentine who has forged a fine reputation as a coach in English football]</b> I am not friends with him but I know him and I admire him and what he has done last year and the year before. It didn’t just happen that he got to the final of the Champions League - it was something that was growing over four or five years<br /><br /><b>[But the former Madrid man hesitates at comparison between the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> boss and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> I don’t think we can put them in the same package. They have coached different teams. I would like to see <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> with one of the really big teams soon because he deserves the opportunity. On the other hand Pep has only ever worked with top teams. He delivered in Spain, he delivered in Germany and he delivered in England. We’ll see now what his next step will be. But they are both top coaches and I have nothing but respect and admiration</p>
