  <p><b>[Perry Groves believes that <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> will commit his future to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> despite entering the final year of his contract at the Emirates]</b> I wouldn’t sell either player. If Alexis wants £350k a week, then give it to him. I would keep them both until January and see where the club is then. If we’re challenging for the title, then risk keeping them. You don’t need to worry about Alexis’ attitude on pitch, he doesn’t know any other way than to fight. Arsene’s comments on players playing for new contracts is right in a way, as players will be thinking about making their respective national teams ahead of the World Cup next summer<br /><br /> I have a gut feeling Mesut is signing a new deal. He loves London, he likes being one of the main players and I don’t think he’ll be indulged as much at other clubs as he is at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He needs to turn up in the big games more, like he did against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final. When he’s on form, there is no more graceful player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> than Mesut Ozil<br /><br />I think it comes down to what other clubs are looking for. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, City, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> probably don’t need <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> as he doesn’t suit their style of play. It’s nothing to do with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s quality, it’s more to do with the other teams style of play. When <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> lose the ball, he doesn’t contribute as much as other players would. He’s not a luxury player if he’s providing assists, scoring goals and creating chances, especially in the big games. If you’re contributing and having an effect on the game, you’re not a luxury player. If you’re not, then you become a luxury player. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> has created more chances than any other player in Europe over the last five seasons, but he needs to up his consistency. I draw comparisons with Anders Limpar, he was the X-factor that could turn a game on its head and then had an off season<br /><br /><b>[when pressed on which of the duo he would retain]</b> <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a>. He works so hard that he’s not really a luxury player. The quality is very similar between the two players, but the difference is that when Alexis has a bad game, he’s still fighting and trying to win possession back. When <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> has a bad game, he can disappear completely. Alexis’ enthusiasm rubs off on every player, he transcends your team and makes other players fight harder</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been warned off a move for Anthony Martial by Perry Groves]</b> Anthony Martial is a quality player but I don’t want Arsenal to sign him this summer. Martial isn’t a priority for us because we have enough players going forward in those areas. He isn’t deemed good enough for Manchester United so I don’t want him at Arsenal. Arsenal’s priority needs to be a new goalkeeper, a new central defender and a very strong defensive midfielder, but that’s been the case for five or six years now.<br /><br />This summer is right time for Arsene Wenger to leave Arsenal. It’s the right time for the club and it’s the right time for Arsene. He’s been receiving abuse from a section of the Arsenal fans that has been far too strong and it was affecting him. I think it also became apparent that Stan Kroenke’s support wasn’t as strong as it once was and Arsene felt the time was right for him to leave before he was eventually pushed this summer<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on who he would hand the reins to]</b> Luis Enrique is my first choice to replace Arsene Wenger. Massimiliano Allegri is second and Diego Simeone is third. Arsenal need a manager who has that winning mentality, who has managed a big club, has proven he can manage big players with big egos and can instil a similar philosophy similar to what Arsene has instilled over the last 22 years. Arsenal need to appoint a big-name manager who can attract world class signings, particularly if the club doesn’t have Champions League football next year. Luis Enrique fits the bill perfectly, he has a massive pedigree and he speaks perfect English</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere will definitely be signing a new contract at Arsenal]</b> I think Jack Wilshere will definitely stay at Arsenal this summer. The hierarchy is trying to cut his wages but they should put him on a pay-as-you-play deal now that he’s got over his injuries and he’s getting back to his best. There’s not many players who have the vision he has and everything he does is about moving forwards. Jack Wilshere would be a big miss because his soul is at the club and the fans love him.<br /><br />I want Jack Butland to replace Petr Cech as Arsenal’s goalkeeper and I would take him in a heartbeat. I think he’s one of the best young goalkeepers in the country and he has a huge physical presence. Any goalkeeper that’s playing for Stoke will look vulnerable, but he would only improve at Arsenal. We would be able to get him for a good price once Stoke are relegated too</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> club hero Perry Groves calls for new <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Welbeck</a> contract as ‘significant ankle injury’ is confirmed]</b> <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Danny Welbeck</a> has suffered a horrendous injury, it looks like a suspected broken ankle and he could be out for the rest of the season, plus his contract is up as well. So I think they should come out now and say you’re going to give him another year. It would just take all the uncertainly away and that would help his rehab on the mental side of it. He’s wealthy boy now, it’s nothing to do with that, but for his mental well-being. I think it would be magnificent gesture from my old club if they offered him a new contract</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> cult hero Perry Groves believes there could be value to be found in a domestic market]</b> From the game midweek <b>[a 4-1 defeat to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>, the thing that was really worrying was the lack of character and the lack of heart. We’re going to see a <b>[Champions League]</b> final that, whatever you say about the two teams, these two teams <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b>, and it pains me to say it because it’s obviously <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, both these two teams have character and have heart. You’ve seen the way they’ve come back in the semi-finals. So the remit now for <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>, he’s got to go and find players.<br /><br />I’m not bothered about world-class players with world-class ability, because <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can’t afford them, that ship has sailed. Now he’s got to buy the character, and the heart is the main thing. A bit like when <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> came to us in 1986, he had to get rid of some high-earning players and put a heart and a soul back in. So the £45 million, you’re now looking at the likes of <a href="ryan-fraser.html">Ryan Fraser</a> at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. He can play wide and he’s got good ability, he’s got heart and character.<br /><br />The two centre-halves at Brighton, Lewis Dunk and Duffy, they’re better than what <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have and they have fight and they have heart. You’ve got to get that sort of player, that sort of character. More heart, more character</p>

Realistically, that’s fourth. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are in a bit of turmoil - <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is not going to be good enough. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are in a little bit of turmoil; they can’t sign any players, they’ve got <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, and they’ve got young players coming in. So fourth place is really going to be competitive and I want us to be in a position to be able to compete. I know it shows how far we’ve dropped, competing for fourth place - but we’ve got to be realistic. And if they sign these younger players, hungry and with the right attitude, then as an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan at the end of the transfer window I’ll think, ‘OK, we’re looking to go forward’</p>

But now he’s coming to the Gooners, I’m actually really excited because he’s better than any of the centre-halves we’ve got and he will bring massive personality to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He’ll also bring leadership, he’ll take responsibility and he’s a winner. He’s won a title in every country he’s played in, in Portugal, England and France, he’s won the Champions League, Europa League and Confederations Cup. His concentration levels have got better and I think he’ll be a lot better if you put someone disciplined in front of him, like N’golo <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> and <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I agree he’s got mistakes in him, but <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> wants his centre-backs to play out from the back and what <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> brings is an unbelievable passing range. He can ping 60 or 70 yard balls, so if you’ve got the pace of <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a>, <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, he can pick them out.<br /><br /><b>[Groves added, with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> looking to hand <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> a star-studded squad for the upcoming campaign]</b> If I read out an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team which could start the first game of the season: Leno; Bellerin, Luiz, Sokratis, Tierney; <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Ceballos</a>, <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a>, Torreira; Pepe, <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>, <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>. That’s going to be like watching the Harlem Globetrotters! I can’t help but be excited. There was all that doom and gloom about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> not having any money and how are we going to compete, but if all these transfers come off, that means <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> would have spent £138m - that’s not bad for a club that is supposed to be skint! As a fan, and I reckon the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporters will be thinking this as well, this is the best transfer window they’ve had for a good 10 or 15 years It’s our most exciting transfer window by a long, long way</p>

I believe they’ll come to an agreement <b>[in January]</b>. On a personal level and a human level he’s in a really bad way. It’s really hurt him. I was booed by <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans and it’s like being disowned by your family. But his reaction was wrong. He should have just apologised, and said I reacted in the wrong way.

In those cases you vote for your mate, don’t you? Or, if not, you vote for someone who has brought a bag of sweets in - it’s like being back at school. He’s clearly very popular in the dressing room, there’s no doubting that. When I was getting booed by the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans I could win them back because I ran around a lot and put the effort in.

  <p><b>[Perry Groves says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have got steadily worse under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>]</b> I think, when he first went in there, there was an intensity because it was too comfortable under <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and he made his stance <b>[clear]</b>. The closing down was a lot more intense - covering more ground. He went 22 games unbeaten over a little period and in the game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> they went 2-1 down and came back. There was a real buzz about the Emirates.<br /><br />And what has happened is he’s got rid of the players he didn’t want, like the Monreals, the Petr Cechs, and Aaron Ramseys but then the players that have been brought in, whether it’s by him or the sporting director, they have actually got steadily worse. That intensity has got less and less and less with a team that he is supposed to be constructing. The thing from watching from the outside is there doesn’t seem to be a desire to do the horrible stuff<br /><br />The thing with the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> situation with <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> is, if you watch them against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, and I’ve been watching <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a lot this year, there is no structure.

If <a href="neal-maupay.html">Maupay</a> has been getting it in his ear all game from <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a> and then scores the winner, he’s absolutely within his rights to go ‘really, what have you got to say now? For <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a> to then grab him around the throat, someone needs - whether it’s <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> or a member of the coaching staff or senior players - to tell <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a> to wind his neck in and concentrate on playing</p>
