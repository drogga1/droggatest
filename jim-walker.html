<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> physio Jim Walker has seen at first hand the ­devastating consequences of what he insists should be recognised as an industrial disease]</b> There are far too many older ­players who are struggling to even get out of their own house.<br /><br />Usually, if you’ve had knee ­surgery, you will get osteoarthritis. You can also get osteoarthritis in the hip, the back and the ankle. Where there are joints, you are vulnerable. The pain eventually becomes worse and worse until it becomes unbearable. So you then have the ex-professional, who wasn’t on the mega wages that today’s top players earn, desperate to have a hip or knee replacement.<br /><br />It could cost £16,000, money he can’t afford, so he doesn’t do anything about it. Then he becomes a virtual prisoner in his own house, too proud to ask for help.<br /><br />It’s a huge price to pay for a football career. But I’ve had discussions with the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> and I’m also ­delighted that two ­high-profile names like <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and <a href="dion-dublin.html">Dion Dublin</a> are willing to help to try and get something done for older players who are ­suffering in ­silence. We want them to get in touch with me through the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> and, hopefully, we can set about trying to improve their lives. Many people have ­images of footballers earning loads of money. That wasn’t the case during my era</p>
