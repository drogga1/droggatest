  <p><b>[Negeri Sembilan head coach Asri Ninggal was in a jubilant mood after his side knocked out Super League’s Selangor 4-3 on penalties]</b> Even though we are a Premier League side and played against Selangor, one of the top teams in Malaysia, the boys showed that whoever we play, we can match them. This will also boost our spirit for our next league matches, and instill a winning mentality. Whoever we play, we are not scared!<br /><br />Both teams had their chances but could not convert them, but what Negeri Sembilan had was team spirit. We fought on until the final moments of the match, even after we missed our first penalty, we showed that we can come back into the match<br /><br />Actually I made five changes to the lineup <b>[against Selangor]</b> because we know we have an important game on Friday, but thank God no player was injured, and bookings in cup matches are not counted in the league. So I think we will <b>[be able to]</b> field our strongest team against Terengganu at Paroi on Friday<br /><br />We have a 30-man squad which we will rotate, and it will also give an opportunity to the reserve players. When they get a chance to play, they will give their all, and we have a healthy competition between the players in the team</p>

  <p><b>[Negeri Sembilan head coach, Asri Ninggal praised his team’s effort and teamwork]</b> I think everybody played hard. We are the underdogs, but we complemented each other. Even though we have good foreigners, our local players also contributed a lot. When we lost the ball, we worked as a team to get it back. When we got the ball, we worked as a team as well so that is why we win tonight.</p>

  <p><b>[Negeri and Sarawak look to seal FA Cup semi spots at home]</b> We only have a slim lead. In football anything is possible. I don’t want our players to get complacent. We still have a long way to go. So far, the performances have been encouraging but we must still continue to work hard.<br /><br />We will not travel to Kuching in search of a draw. So we must find a way to score. At the same time our defence must be more airtight</p>
