  <p><b>[The U.S. has been playing in the 4-3-3 for the better part of two years now]</b> I’m quite grateful we’re in a 4-3-3, it’s a lot more fluid, fun attacking style to play. I think the 4-4-2, how we played it and how it always is is a little rigid, so I think <b>[the 4-3-3]</b> is lot more fun</p>

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd’s teammates have also been impressed with the work she’s put in off the field]</b> Carli is a phenomenal athlete and a phenomenal teammate and seeing her journey from the last World Cup and the Olympics until now is really actually inspiring for me. Just her work ethic day in and day out and her appetite for this big moment, I think she’s really grown into it and she’s playing as good as I’ve ever seen her now</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="alyssa-naeher.html">Alyssa Naeher</a> became a U.S. women’s national team hero. The U.S. goalkeeper made a massive fingertip save in the first half to deny a long-range strike from <a href="keira-walsh.html">Keira Walsh</a>]</b> There’s no words I can give you to let you know how proud I personally am of Alyssa and how proud our entire team is. It was so epic</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Christen Press explains why USWNT mediation talks broke down]</b> I think, unfortunately, it was just the concept of paying us equally. We were very hopeful in our discussions with them that they were going to take our proposals and our positions seriously, which is simply that every game that we play, we get compensated the same way a man would for playing or winning that game. And it broke down right there<br /><br /><b>[With no agreement in sight, the two sides appear likely to resolve their differences in court]</b> We are very confident that if this needs to go to litigation that we have a great case</p>
