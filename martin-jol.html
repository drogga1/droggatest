  <p><b>[In November 2007, weeks after his sacking, the Dutchman wrote the preface for Martin Jol: The Inside Story, in which he discussed <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s transfer policy of acquiring youth to nurture them into stars]</b> The club’s policy of buying players for the future was a sound one. but there are occasions when you need a bit of experience, when you need a leader in certain areas of the pitch. The truth is that I needed another <a href="ledley-king.html">Ledley King</a> in central defence, and maybe a leader like Ledley in midfield<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest regret is that King was not there for all of the time, and was not there for this season when I needed him the most. Youngsters cannot do it on their own, they need help.<br /><br />I believed in the players we had but more experience would have made the difference. Look at <a href="michael-dawson.html">Michael Dawson</a>, he’s been outstanding alongside King, but looked inexperienced since Ledley’s been injured. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, <a href="younes-kaboul.html">Kaboul</a> and <a href="darren-bent.html">Bent</a> have that chance to prove themselves, but they really do need experience alongside them</p>
