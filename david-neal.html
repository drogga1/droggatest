  <p>[Previewing Fox’s World Cup debut] ESPN did a fabulous job with the World Cup. They were largely responsible for the growth of soccer in the United States over the past decade-plus, so really for us they set such a high bar. We want to begin by just equaling that bar and in our own way we hope to exceed it.<br /><br />[An emphasis on American voices] I think the fact that four of our six play-by-play voices are American is something that should be celebrated. It really reflects the fact that the game is growing exponentially in the U.S. and that we don’t have to go offshore to find qualified voices. That was certainly by design and something that I’m extremely proud of and excited about<br /><br />[Will calling off monitor be off-putting?] Really it’s much ado about nothing. If you look at the global standard of the way soccer is covered day in and day out, at least half, if not more than half of the matches that are watched on any given day in any country involve commentators who are doing them off tube [from a monitor]. There are European rights-holders for the World Cup who are not sending any on-air talent to Russia so it’s a little puzzling to me that this has become such a point of interest because really, for anyone that knows anything about how soccer is televised around the world, this is standard procedure<br /><br />[On Aly Wagner] She earned this role at the World Cup by doing terrific work last summer during the Confederations Cup. She’s just someone who understands how to explain a sport that can sometimes be complex and mysterious. She sees it, she breaks it down into its absolute basics and makes it easily understood<br /><br />[Russia serves up its share of controversy] We don’t go in with any presumption that we’re news journalists - we’re not. I don’t think viewers are watching the World Cup to watch a discussion of Russia-U.S. relations. I think there are plenty of networks out there who will provide that for them. Viewers are coming to us to watch the World Cup … If we start to get into anything outside of that area, I think we’re doing a disservice to our viewers<br /><br />[A unique set in Red Square] It’s about building relationships. You need to be vested, you need to be partners with the organizing committees, you need to share your vision early and then continue to pursue it. That’s been our relationship with FIFA. Early on we laid out what we wanted to do and we stuck with it. We had to go through various iterations of it but it’s relationship building</p>
