  <p><b>[Moussa Dembele insists the intense speculation surrounding his future at Celtic has been no distraction]</b> I don’t really listen to what has been said in the media. I don’t really follow it. I just try to do my best when I’m out on the pitch and show everyone the level of how good I am. It’s easy not to get distracted. I’m a very calm kind of guy and I don’t really let this type of thing get in my head. I focus only on enjoying my football at Celtic and I’m very happy to be here. I don’t really listen to what has been said about me – I just try to get fit as quickly as possible and back on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic phenomenon Moussa Dembele is already Scotland’s finest talent]</b> My best play comes in the big games - I can’t explain it.<br /><br />Am I worth £40 million? You tell me, I don’t know. A price is a price - I can’t tell you if I’m worth £40m or £50m, £30m or £20m. I just concentrate on my game. It feels great to be called a £40 million striker, because it means I am not doing badly, I think? I just focus on my season and at the end I will go on holiday and enjoy that. We just need to keep going forward<br /><br />It was the day my Celtic career took off. I hope it is going to be more than three goals this time. I could have scored more that day. If I scored three, then I could have scored five. But I still wouldn’t be happy because I had scored five</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic striker Moussa Dembele has hailed the influence that team-mate Kolo Toure has had on him over the course of the last year]</b> Since the first day I came here, I’ve spoken to Kolo Toure. He’s like a big brother to me and I’m thankful that he’s been around. Everyone’s impressed me, though, it’s hard to put a finger on just one player.<br /><br /><b>[On Brendan Rogers]</b> I met him in London and he spoke about what he what he wanted to do with me and how we could work together and I liked what he said. Afterwards, when I came out of the meeting I had a different view about my future. He told me how he wanted me to play, how he wanted the team to play<br /><br />He had a past where he used to be a youth coach so he knows young players very well. He’s been good to me. He speaks a lot to his players and tries to make an improvement, take time with them. That’s why I think he’s helped me a lot. He’s improved me a lot - in every aspect of the game, I would say. He’s given the same advice to everyone: it’s to work hard and believe in your dream. He hasn’t told me anything in particular. I just have to work every day and make sure that I do everything for my dream to come true and for good things to happen for me</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Dembele reacts to The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Coach 2017 <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s praise]</b> It means a lot to me when a legend - because <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is a legend - praises and makes positive comments about me. It’s good. I was pleased but at first I was shocked to hear that. The fact that my work is not something that goes unnoticed, and the fact that a legend like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> speaks like that of me, my football ability and especially my future, gives you an incentive to wake up in the morning and do a better job than others, and get where I want to be</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Dembele has admitted that he had to fight hard to ensure he made a deadline day move to Lyon from Celtic]</b> It was a certainty that I wanted to come to Lyon. I was determined to come here and the Celtic board had to back down. It was hard. I gave everything and, finally, it paid of.</p>
