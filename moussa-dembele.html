  <p><b>[Moussa Dembele reacts to The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Coach 2017 <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s praise]</b> It means a lot to me when a legend - because <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is a legend - praises and makes positive comments about me. It’s good. I was pleased but at first I was shocked to hear that. The fact that my work is not something that goes unnoticed, and the fact that a legend like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> speaks like that of me, my football ability and especially my future, gives you an incentive to wake up in the morning and do a better job than others, and get where I want to be</p>
