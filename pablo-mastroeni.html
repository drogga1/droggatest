  <p><b>[The Colorado Rapids have signed veteran forward Alan Gordon as a free agent]</b> Alan has a lot of the qualities that we look for in a center forward and we are certain he will help us increase our attacking output. He has been an exemplary pro with a wealth of experience playing in this league, and we’re confident that he will bring the right mentality to our group</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Howard looks strong in return from four-month injury layoff]</b> It was mostly about how he felt, and making sure he was completely recovered from the injury, and not having to think about whether or not he can kick the ball because he wasn’t there yet. He felt great this week, and I think he’s ready to rock.</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Mastroeni has seen Bruce Arena’s coaching evolution like few have]</b> Every time I ever played for Bruce I knew exactly what he wanted from me in my role as an individual. And then collectively as a team we knew what we wanted to do.<br /><br />Did he do it with power points and magnets on a white board? No, he has his own way of communicating. Whether it’s pulling people aside, showing video, whether it’s walking across the field and saying, ‘Hey, I want to play on that side of the field and I want to move our lines and move as a group.’ He just found simple ways to articulate exactly what we wanted, and because they were simple, everyone was on the same page and knew what he wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Mastroeni went on a rather public rant last month about stats and analytics not telling the entire story in soccer matches]</b> Stats will lose to the human spirit every day of the week. It’s too simple to say that if you have the better stats you deserve to win the game. The game is very nuanced, and that’s the sweet spot of the game.<br /><br />What analytics can’t tell you is how much heart you had, how much fight, how much desire you had to hold on to a lead when you weren’t at your very best. That metric, in sport, is what you call the intangibles. I can’t put my finger in it but this team has something about them, they believe they’re going to win these games. Stats can’t give you that, because you’re going to look at the stats and think, ‘They shouldn’t have won.’ The intangibles are the unknown, but they’re also a stat - we just don’t know how to quantify that<br /><br />Nobody cares, at the end of the day, how much possession you have if you’re not winning games. That’s the thing. Stylistically is never even a concern when you’re not winning games. You win a few ugly, and you know what happens? People start to play a little bit more free, and more relaxed, and there’s not as much pressure on you<br /><br />If all those other stats are so critical and so important, then why don’t we just change the game and make those stats decide who wins the game? The last time I checked the only stat that counts is the first one on the score sheet, the score of the game</p>
