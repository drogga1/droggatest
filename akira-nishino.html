  <p><b>[Japan coach Nishino reflects on tough clash against Senegal at World Cup]</b> It was a tough match and we knew it would be tough. We came back from behind twice and we knew Senegal were not a team that we could beat easily. We pressed well though, and didn’t let them play their way. We didn’t let them capitalise on their physicality. Towards the end, our players knew how to deal with them and were even running better<br /><br /><b>[Currently tied on points with Senegal at the top of the table, Japan, who handed Colombia a 2-1 defeat in their tournament opener, need just a point from Thursday’s clash with Poland to confirm their place in the last 16]</b> Of course, it is very important to neutralise Mane and <b>[Hiroki]</b> Sakai did a pretty good job neutralising him and dulling his threat. What we were more concerned about was him giving a positive impact to other players, especially in the first half when we let him and other players play too freely. But after that I think we did pretty well</p>

  <p><b>[Akira Nishino ‘devastated’, the coach taking the responsibility away from his players following Nacer Chadli’s last-gasp winner]</b> I do not want to admit it, I feel it was a tragedy, but I have to accept the defeat as a fact. I feel devastated. I am very disappointed. A very small difference, I thought there wasn’t anything in it between us. Maybe it was my decisions as a coach or my tactics and we couldn’t catch or keep up with Belgium. I was questioning myself, whether I had the control of the game. We were 2-0 up and still the score was reversed. I don’t think it was the players to be blamed, it was me who might have lost control of the game. And when that goal was conceded I blamed myself, and I questioned my tactics<br /><br /><b>[Japan surprised many by securing progression from Group G, considering their dismal showing in Brazil in 2014]</b> Four years ago in Brazil, we did not make it to the last 16. Four years passed, we have been training hard, the players playing hard. We were determined to go through to the next stage. I wanted my players to have a different mentality to the ones Japanese players had in the past. And I think we did succeed in having a different mentality, but the skills were missing, so four years from now we’d like to come back. The players played to the best of their ability. So, the result I cannot really call a success, but we can be more successful next time</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand head coach Akira Nishino does not take into account the recent results recorded by his charges]</b> In order to qualify to the next round, we need to do well in all our matches. It doesn’t matter if Thailand beat UAE and Malaysia lost to UAE. What is important is how we play, focusing game by game and delivering good results. I need time to implement my philosophy on the team, to adapt accordingly</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand’s Nishino keeps cool head despite defeat to Malaysia]</b> My players were not determined enough to get the equaliser, and that was why we lost. Almost all of our departments did not play well. The grass type <b>[of the pitch]</b> might have played a small role, especially when Malaysia players are more familiar with it, but that’s not the point (cause). My team lacked composure. We knew since the day of the draw that it was going to be a very difficult group, so for now we’ll be focusing on recovery and on doing well in the next match. Right now we need to focus on ourselves because we still have matches to play, and we need to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Nishino hails new aggressive Thai approach]</b> As the host country, there was a lot expected of us in the match against Bahrain so from the very start of the game we wanted to be aggressive in our approach. From the first goal onwards the players were hungry and eager to claim the win. Before the match, I believed that if we adopted a negative approach the game would go that way as well, so I told my players to be on the front foot<br /><br />I have been telling my players to be aggressive and they did just that on the pitch against Bahrain. The improvement you can see in the players since the SEA Games is down to how they have been managed and in tonight’s game I feel they were energetic and performed well</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand undone by dubious VAR call as Nishino sees potential in squad]</b> This game is our 4th match. The game form of the day made it not very good. But I think both teams played to the best of our abilities. Since the group stages, our players have been working hard. We started the game well in the first 15-20 minutes, playing the way we want. But there are some events in the game, I would not like to talk about<br /><br />Throughout the four games, I believe that our players have gained invaluable experience. And they will be the backbone of the 2026 World Cup goal. All players will be able to take this experience to the top and develop themselves to be a better player in the future</p>
