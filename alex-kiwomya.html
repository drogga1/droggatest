  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Alex Kiwomya says his deep bond with Tottenham’s Dele Alli and his young but glittering career is proving inspirational]</b> I have known Dele Alli since I was fourteen. We are really good friends, best friends. He is the godfather to my child so he always tries to see him when he can. When August, my son, sees him on TV, he goes ‘woaaah’. I think with Del, it is amazing as I went to watch him when he was at MK Dons and he hasn’t changed one bit. I respect him so much for that. Even the way he plays - he hasn’t changed the way he plays. He is just with better players now.<br /><br />He is just absolutely blowing everyone away with what he can do. I had no shadow of a doubt in him and we are always speaking to each other about football and what’s going on. We like even just talking about personal stuff, it is nice to know that even though he has got all those England caps, all those big goals. He is just Del, he is just the same guy. I want to play in the Premier League, one day <b>[like him]</b>. It is going to take a lot of work and dedication. I have got that so it is just keeping at it and when I get the chance to impress someone I have to make them think, ‘I will take a chance on him and I will take him in and see what he can do<br /><br /><b>[Being a dad]</b> has massively, <b>[changed my perspective]</b> to be honest. It is hard but it is the best thing to ever happen to me. It has made me focus on football a lot more. I was focused before, but it is just now that I am providing for him that I need to make sure I am on it every day. I want to make sure that he grows up having the best things that he can have and that means I have to work my socks off to keep food on the table and a roof over his head<br /><br />People don’t treat me differently <b>[in League 2]</b> because I am a Chelsea loanee. Even the players at the club, they don’t look at me like that. They look at me as a player here to get minutes and I am here to get experience. Under-23 football is completely different to first-team football anywhere. The pace is so much quicker, it is just adjusting and getting used to it and I feel like I have done that. Three points matters<br /><br />That’s the main thing, you go out and it is make or break. People are playing for their careers and their jobs. If you get relegated then it is going to be tough to get back up. It is a lot more physical as well. The players get stuck into you, I have had a couple of injuries. I had a dislocated shoulder a while back. Crewe are a footballing team. So are Chelsea. So you just have to keep to the roots that I grew up playing and that’s very good here. In training we pop the ball about and work on it. We don’t work on just long balls into a big striker so it is developing me also. It is always good to be at the top of the league and clear but you really test your will and how much you want it being that low <b>[in the table]</b>. Some teams will fall off but we are climbing back up. I have got lots of minutes under my belt and that’s what Chelsea send you out on loan to do - to get minutes, goals and games under your belt. That’s what I have done here so it couldn’t be going any better<br /><br />I always banter him a bit and then give him his praises when he scores. For the bad tackle <b>[versus Gent]</b>, I gave him a bit but he takes it well. He is funny guy, a very funny guy</p>
