That was the closest he ever got to testing himself on the grandest stage, but did win two African titles with the Pharaohs-in 2006 and 2008. He missed the 2010 success due to injury, but came alive in the latter stages of the earlier successes. In '06, he scored twice in the group stage and then netted the decisive penalty in the shootout, before netting the only goal of the final in '08 as Cameroon were defeated 1-0 in Accra.">
