To be part of this club and to have this opportunity is great. I’m very happy to be part of Manchester City’s team and I look forward to trying to do my best to help the team reach their goals. If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best. Of course when you have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don’t say no. As we all know, what he did in Barcelona and Bayern Munich was amazing and we expect also here that he will win titles. It’s great to be working with him and to have this opportunity..</p>

I would love to have him here - and you never know - but that is for City to decide. He can be a superstar - in fact, I think he is already a little bit of a superstar. He is a great player to play with because he is so intelligent with his movement. It is perfect to have someone like him when you’re a midfield player because he is very fast, very clever, and a good finisher. It’s crazy to think he is only 18 or 19. He can be one of the best in the world very soon.<br /><br />It is great to have him alongside me in Manchester. It was great to play alongside him last season and I hope that we can achieve a lot of things together. Honestly, when I signed for City I spoke to him about coming as well. I said ‘come on Mendy, come with me’ because he is a great player and he can really help this team</p>

The team played an amazing game, three well deserved points and now we have to think about the Champions League, because we want another three points there to help us progress. To be here and to be able to learn from all these fantastic players, it’s an amazing opportunity, I’m very happy to be here, and I hope I can help the team to achieve the goals<br /><br />Yes I think so, last season we played good football with Monaco and with the national team as well, but this performance that the team has been able to achieve over the last games has been outstanding</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva happy with rotation role at Man City]</b> It’s fantastic to be part of this group, and to be part of a team that wins so many games in a row and has been so successful so far. The atmosphere in this club at the moment is fantastic, and like I said, it’s great to be part of this team.<br /><br />We still have a game before the New Year, so we still have a game on the 31st against Crystal Palace. Of course that’s a good difference. But in football everything is possible, we have to keep winning to keep the distance and not give a chance for our rivals to approach</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva has called on referees to do their job and protect his team-mates from overly physical opponents]</b> Obviously. The coach and everyone already spoke about that. It’s clear over the last few months, we’ve seen with Leroy it was a terrible accident and now he’s injured for two months - a very important player. <b>[On Wednesday]</b> it could have been Brahim, it could have been Kevin on the second goal. I think, as the coach says, the referees have to do their job and, if it’s a red card, they have to give the red card. They are not doing that over the last few months. We hope that soon they start protecting our players because the way other teams are tackling our players is not part of the game, it’s not fair play and they have to try to punish the players that play this way.<br /><br />France is really physical; I think maybe even a little bit more than here. What you have here is obviously the referees let you play a little bit more, so the game is more intense, and the quality of the players <b>[is higher]</b> because the teams in England have more money and they pay better salaries so obviously they have better players. It’s the best league in the world - most of the people know that - it’s complicated to play here. It’s physical and very technical at the same time and it’s always difficult to play against this kind of team<br /><br />I’ve never played much on the left but this season I’ve played a few times on the left, on the right, in the middle, as a number nine in the last game. It’s not my normal position but I feel comfortable to play in the middle as well. I know I’m not a fast player like Sane or Sterling, I know I cannot do some of the things that they can. But I try to do other things and of course I try to improve myself. I feel like I’m getting better and better. I want to try to get even better because this is not even close to what I can do for this team so I think I’m improving and I want to improve more and more. I knew when I first arrived that it wouldn’t be easy to get into the team probably as fast I wanted to. I’m feeling really well, I’m feeling like I’m helping the team. That’s what I wanted to do: to help this this club achieve their goals because they put a lot of trust in me when they paid a lot of money so I’m trying every game to give 100 per cent of myself to get better and better to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva is looking to help Manchester City wrap up the Premier League title]</b> We will try to do our best to finish the Premier League as soon as we can. It’s not finished yet, and we have to do a serious job, keep concentrated and focus, and then to try something in the Champions League as well. Especially because here in England you do not have the winter break. Normally I would say Spanish teams, without the additional competition and with the winter break, they are fresher than us. So to be able to finish the Premier League before the main games in the Champions League would be great, so we can rest a bit and be 200 per cent in the Champions League games. But we know it is not easy to win the Premier League in April, especially with very difficult games ahead of us.<br /><br />Obviously when you win and keep winning, it’s easier to maintain this atmosphere, but the atmosphere in the Man City dressing room is amazing. All the staff, all the players. Personally, when I arrived everyone helped me so much in the beginning and still now. It’s great to be a part of this club. My job is doing what I most like in the world, to play football, so to be able to be a football player, especially playing in an amazing club, probably in the best league in the world, is the perfect job for me. When I was five, 10, 15 years old, I always dreamed of being in the best league in the world, playing with some of the best clubs. To be at Man City, to play alongside some of the best players, it is great. It was a dream that became true for me</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is irreplaceable]</b> It’s important that people understand that he’s irreplaceable. When he wants to leave, there will be a group with a very high level and I think we can maintain that. I hope to be one of those players, I have ambition and obviously I will give my best to help. When Cristiano goes, we will lose the best player in Portuguese football. We will try to keep this level with the national team, but it doesn’t worry me right now seeing myself in the role of the fan’s idol. These things can happen or not, but they have to be natural.</p>

It was also a moment I had been waiting for my whole life - I had worked so hard to get there. But when my teammates came out of the tunnel at the Stade de France, I was hundreds of kilometers away. I wasn’t living my dream. I was in a hotel room in Switzerland, watching the game on television</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva is hoping to see Manchester City offer him some Portuguese support this summer]</b> The problem is that now I’m the only Portuguese guy on the team. I am surrounded by the Brazilians, the Spaniards, the English, and they think it’s funny to play pranks on me on Instagram. They’ve tied my boots to the ceiling. They’ve tossed me in the pool with all my clothes on. Even though we were Premier League champions, going to training every day felt like it did when you were a kid, when you were just having fun. That’s pretty rare in football, I think. The guys behind it are usually the Brazilian Crew: Fernandinho, Ederson, Danilo and Gabriel Jesus, and I’ve become really close friends with them. I swear, this summer, after the World Cup, I’m gonna convince Pep to buy some Portuguese players. I don’t even care whether they’re good or not. They just need to be very creative with pranks. That’s all I ask<br /><br />For me, there is no better place to be than Man City. A lot has been written about Pep, but I still don’t think people fully understand how much he is a master of details. Before games he often says that he is giving us the map, but that we have to solve the riddles out on the pitch. For anyone who is obsessed with football, he’s the perfect manager to learn from. I wake up every day so happy to be playing football here. On the day that I signed with City, I sent the Monaco guys a message with a photo of me holding up my jersey, and I said, ‘It’s done, guys. When are you joining us?’ Mendy said, ‘Man! Now I’ve gotta come over too!’. Kylian <b>[Mbappe]</b> grew up a fan of PSG, so I think he was destined for Paris, but two months later, Mendy signed with City, too</p>

He’s been the highest scorer in the Champions League and won a third Champions League in a row. It’s his decision. As a team-mate, I hope so because he helps us so much. He’s a fantastic player. We don’t need to describe him. So hopefully he stays but it’s his decision. In this World Cup, he helped us so much, scoring four goals. So, yes, it seems like he’s getting better with age. I hope he stays but we’ll see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva has admitted to being aware of interest from Manchester United]</b> There was a guy on the plane who thought I was going to Man United. He was a United fan. I didn’t tell him he was wrong. But, yeah, a lot of people didn’t know where I was going. I heard about the interest and I’ve friends at United. One of the physios there was with me at Monaco. The manager, of course, is Portuguese and I’ve met him around. Victor Lindelof - we were in the same year in Benfica. Nemanja Matic, I trained with him in Benfica, so I know a few players. But if I have to be precise, the only official offer my agent got was the one from City. I was really happy with the offer from such a fantastic club and I have to think it was the right decision.<br /><br />In my last season at Monaco, my agent would not tell me the clubs that were interested in me. He wanted me to be fully focused for Monaco. He’d say ‘At the end of the season, we will talk’. I knew people were talking about certain clubs. Then after the end of the season, four days after the last game, he called me and said City were interested and it was a great opportunity for me<br /><br />Of course it’s good to be associated with those kind of players. If he’s not the best player ever, he’s very close. Him and Cristiano Ronaldo are on another level and nobody can be compared to them. At my age, Messi had won two or three Ballon d’Ors</p>

From the first training session with him, you could see how he touched the ball, how he went past defenders. You could see he was a different player. His first important match was against Manchester City, I think people will remember that game.<br /><br />He won the World Cup, he was maybe the best French player. I don’t think he will win the Ballon d’Or this year, but in a few years. I think it will be either Luka Modric or Cristiano Ronaldo.<br /><br />For fans, it is annoying to always see your players leave. In France, it is not always easy to keep your players, because the players are always going to want to try different things. Ben <b>[Mendy]</b> is here, Fabinho is playing at Liverpool, Bakayoko was at Chelsea, now at AC Milan, Lemar at Atletico. We said that if we kept the team together as it was at Monaco for two or three years we always said that we could win the Champions’ League</p>

Even though they lost tonight, they’re still contenders. I think it will be harder because last season nobody was expecting us to win as many games and to reach that level of points so this season the teams they know they have to do better to beat us. Of course it will be very hard, but we will work every game to get the three points and at the end of it try and celebrate winning one more Premier League.<br /><br />We know that we can still improve a lot. I think the beginning of the season was very good for us, even though we have the same points as Liverpool and the other teams are very close, but, it is what it is, we have to keep staying concentrated and to try to have a gap from those teams</p>

So that was the point, not because United is not a very good team and not a contender.<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> He represents our country in a very good way.

For the confidence it is always good to beat them. But it is just a game. If we lose the next one this doesn’t mean anything. Try to keep playing the same way as we have the last two games and try to not let happen what happened to us a few weeks back.<br /><br />We knew that if we lost it would almost be over because 10 points is a lot. Now, four points, we believe it is possible, knowing the Premier League is a very tough competition. The pressure was a little bit more onto us. We are used to that kind of pressure. We got three very important points against a fantastic team.</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva says the club has complete belief in Pep Guardiola’s varying tactical set ups]</b> During the season we have tried many different things. We adapt to the way the other teams play. We try to attack the best way we think we can do, when they play four in the back, five in the back, when they play with four midfielders, three midfielders, one attacker, two attackers. So <b>[against Arsenal]</b> it was a good performance. We are happy with the tactics because it worked. We just follow what Pep tells us because we believe in him. Once again it worked, so we are very happy with that<br /><br />We know we have to improve. Even though we have some fantastic performances, sometimes we don’t play as well as we want to. We have to improve that, to see which mistakes we are making, with the help of the staff, and try to improve all the team. The atmosphere in the dressing room is fantastic. Everybody is trying to help each other to improve, and to try and help the mate next to you. We just want to be the better players game by game, be a better team, to try and win some titles at the end of the season<br /><br />We knew after the Newcastle defeat we had to give a response to that game. Especially here in front of our fans. We’re very happy with the win, very happy with the way we played tonight because I think it was a good performance. And back to winning days. Mentally it’s good for us. Because now we have two very difficult games against Everton and Chelsea which we want to win. We know that if we don’t it will start getting very difficult to fight for this Premier League<br /><br />It’s a pleasure to have <b>[Aguero]</b> with us, scoring another three goals tonight, a fantastic performance. I’ve played with Cristiano in the national team, so it wouldn’t be fair to say yes. I think Sergio is just a fantastic player and we are so happy to have him with us. It’s a privilege to have a player like Kun in our team, that scores in the big games like he showed again today. I just hope that he can keep going this way and helping us winning more games and titles</p>

If we don’t win our games, it doesn’t matter what they do so that is the most important thing now.<br /><br />This one was one of the best <b>[performances]</b> probably because we played against one of the best sides in the world, we beat them 6-0. But I think, even this season against Liverpool at home, even though we just won 2-1, it was a fantastic performance.<br /><br />It helps you for the confidence and for everything to start the game pressing high, creating chances, having the ball like last season and this season. Lately we have scored lots of goals in the first five minutes, which is very good. The match plan was the same as always, trying to control the game, trying to have the ball, trying to create chances, trying to press high and we were lucky enough that almost every time we went there we scored.

We can win three or lose all of them as well, so it will be very tough, so yeah, we know that the last month-and-a-half will be very tough.

  <p><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> defends Bernardo Silva against racism allegations following controversial tweet]</b> Honestly, I don’t know what will happen. They should put their focus on another issue because they don’t know which guy you are talking about. Bernardo is one of the most lovely people I ever met in my life. He speaks four or five languages and that is the best way to understand how open-minded he is and one of his best friends is Mendy. He’s like a brother to him.<br /><br />The image is not about the colour of the skin. He took a picture of Benjamin when he was young and he related it to this cartoon, which was quite similar for the image. If they want to do that <b>[investigate]</b> and ask for Bernardo, I think he will be open to talk. But first you have to know exactly which person you are talking about. There are many situations with people, with white people and you look at a cartoon and the face is quite similar as your face and you put it in there, it is quite similar. I think the response from Mendy was clear after that. They are joking all the time. Maybe what I say as advice is to hide social media, if something happened it would be a mistake. Bernardo is an exceptional person. A guy who can speak five languages, it’s because he’s open-minded - nothing about the colour of the skin, nationalities or whatever</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva writes to FA expressing regret over any offence in Mendy tweet]</b> We spoke many times about what happened in stadiums, regarding Bernardo I was incredibly clear. If the people believe Bernardo is this type of person they are completely wrong. They judge one joke, I judge three years with him. Bernardo, or anyone else in my squad, do this thing for a joke. Benjamin is like a brother to Bernardo, that is what I see every single day here.<br /><br />If someone feels bad for that tweet it can happen, but the people who judge Bernardo don’t know him. He’s an exceptional person. He likes to be involved in different situations. It’s a cartoon and the face is quite similar. The same happened a thousand, million times with white people.

It hurts a lot because when you start a season, you always want to go for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it’s the main competition and the most important for the fans. So it’s very disappointing, no one expected us to be this far from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in January or February so it’s something that we need to learn from.

I think little details make a huge difference and if you look at us this season, all the little details never went our way. It’s not an excuse, we should’ve done better, and we are very disappointed in ourselves. But if you look at the injuries we’ve had, the VAR decisions that never went our way - and I’m not complaining, but in football, it sometimes goes your way and sometimes not.

He’s a good friend of mine, I’ve played with him since we were in the Under-19s with Portugal. His qualities? He has a great work rate, very intelligent and he’s a guy who arrives very well in the box, scores a lot of goals, gets assists. He’s a crucial player and is showing that in the first few weeks. I’m happy for him, he’s had a great start. He asked me about Manchester and I said what I thought was right. It’s a great club for him, it’s a great opportunity and he’s doing great.

I want to beat him obviously<br /><br /><b>[When asked why no top clubs had snapped up Fernandes before this season]</b> I don’t know why. He was quite expensive and sometimes it’s not easy to get a player like Bruno because teams always demand so much money for players like him. But I think he’s worth the value that they paid and he’s showing it right now. I think the people should stay calm though. Even though he’s a great player it’s just the beginning. People should give him space to work and to do his job well. It’s a good start and hopefully he can keep going that way. But he can handle the pressure, yes. He was Sporting’s captain for more than two seasons and he was the leader there - and I think he can be a leader at Man United as well<br /><br />It’s a very special game for the players, and for the fans and we want to give them this win. We know how difficult it is to play there. When you play against a team like <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> with their fans, the history and everything, it’s always special to play them.

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva paid tribute to <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> Personally, I have learned a lot not only from him, but all my team-mates, since I arrived at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He is one of the best managers ever. It is great to have him with us<br /><br />I know my team-mates, the influence that he has since he arrived at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is huge. You could see it with the results, with the titles in the last three seasons. Since I have arrived, we have won plenty of trophies. It is not just that, it is the way we play. We think that we make our fans enjoy the way we play - offensive football, creating chances, scoring goals, <b>[playing]</b> attractive football</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva admits Replacing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is impossible, nobody can do it]</b> Taking <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>’s place is impossible. Nobody is going to do that. I’m going to try and always keep improving so I can do the best I can for Portugal and my club - helping my country and team to win everything possible<br /><br />Kun is goals. There’s nothing more to say about him. He hits it so hard. If you give him a bad ball, he hits it well. It’s so good to have a player who scores so easily. That’s why he’s the player with most goals in City’s history and I think he’s close to the record for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. If he carries on like this he’ll get there.<br /><br /><b>[Silva gets to work with on a regular basis at present is namesake <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>]</b>	He’s got a lot of football left in him. With David’s style of play he can play as long as he wants. He’s really smart, he always makes the right choices and he’s physically in great shape. He can play for as long as he wants</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star Bernardo Silva warned <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> could not be written off despite his side’s strong position in the Champions League last-16 tie]</b> You can’t write any team off, far less Madrid who have won 13 European Cups. No one else has the experience Madrid’s players have in this competition, so we can’t think we’ve already beaten them. It’s all very open. When you play a side like Madrid nothing is ever certain. We’ve seen a lot of ties in the last few years get turned around. Look at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> last year, beating <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> 3-0 and then losing 4-0. You never know. It’s a good result and we’re in a great position to go through to the quarter-finals. It’s a tough match and we’ll need to play well and maintain our concentration<br /><br />In the last three years we’ve won everything in England, last season we won all four English titles, this year we’ve won the Super Cup and the League Cup, we’re still in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and we want to win that. But the Champions League is the title the club, the players and Pep in England want to win. We know it’s a tough tournament, but we’ll fight for it.<br /><br /><b>[Silva recently described <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> as one of the best managers ever]</b> I know my team-mates, the influence that he has since he arrived at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is huge.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star Bernardo Silva gives verdict on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> vs <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> debate]</b> It will be something special and unique to tell my kids and grandkids I was able to give him some assists. He’s an example on and off the pitch. With Portugal, we train in the morning. In the afternoon everyone plays cards or PlayStation, but he goes to the gym. In the big moments, when you need him the most, he’s always there<br /><br /><b>[while the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> v <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> debate has now raged for over a decade]</b> It’s a debate that’s not debatable. I think we need to feel privileged to be able to watch them at the same time together. They are two of the best players ever - if not the two best players ever.<br /><br />It was an amazing feeling. When we played <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> <b>[with <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> in the Champions League]</b>, the atmosphere was amazing. After the game I was talking to my team-mates and we were saying: ‘Wow, the atmosphere in England is really good. One day I’d like to play there’. At the end of the season when they contacted me and said they wanted to buy me; it was a pleasure to join the club. So far, I’ve been very happy at the club - so it was a great choice. I’ve been lucky to play for a team like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. It’s a pleasure to be here with such amazing players and staff and be able to win so many trophies.</p>
