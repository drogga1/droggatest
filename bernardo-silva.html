  <p><b>[on Euro 2016 final]</b> ll the French were in one hotel room, and all the Portuguese were in the other. That was the only way to keep the peace. When we faced France in the Euro 2016 final it was the biggest game in the history of Portuguese football. It was also a moment I had been waiting for my whole life - I had worked so hard to get there. But when my teammates came out of the tunnel at the Stade de France, I was hundreds of kilometers away. I wasn’t living my dream. I was in a hotel room in Switzerland, watching the game on television</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> lining up new long-term deal for Bernardo Silva]</b> The final stages are concluding for a lot of new contracts with positive news expected soon. We are convinced he is the heir to his midfield namesake <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>. He’s probably been our best player this season. He has stepped comfortably into the huge void left by Kevin De Bruyne, who has struggled with injury. Bernardo absolutely loves being at City and all the people connected with it, this is one big happy family for him. He has seen some of the other guys pledging their futures and is ready to do the same. Playing for Pep is a dream for him.</p>

We don’t need to prove anything to anyone, after what we’ve done the last two seasons. We’re relaxed. Of course we’re not happy, because we want to do better and we know losing against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> isn’t ideal, but all teams have good and bad moments. It’s impossible to stay three seasons, only with good moments. Sometimes you will have bad moments and it’s the way you react to those bad moments that shows and proved how good a team you are and that’s what we’ll try to do.

He’s very intelligent and when you understand the game and you’re intelligent like he is, it’s easy. Obviously it’s not the ideal situation, because we don’t have a lot of centre-backs right now, but it’s what we have and we have no complaints. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> we’re five points behind. We want to do better, we want to try to close the gap a little bit, but in the Champions League it was a great way to start the group stage.

David and I sometimes play in the same position and have the same style but I think it’s unfair on David to be compared to me because he has played at a huge level for 15 years and I am just starting. The team will go on. Yaya left, Vinny last season, Kun <b>[<a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>]</b> one day will go.

The difference of working with the same manager and same team-mates for three months or two years makes a huge difference. For example when you pass to Sterling you know where exactly you have to put the ball. When you first arrive, you don’t know that. You learn it<br /><br /><b>[Bernardo also added that he has sympathy for <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a>, whose lack of time on the pitch this season has drawn some eyebrows]</b> When I was in Portugal and a good <b>[young talent]</b> came through from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, Sporting or Porto people wanted them to develop as fast as possible. But not many players can go from young teams at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, City, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> into the first team when they are 19. That’s normal too. Look, Phil wants to play and that’s OK but look at the players he has ahead in his position. So it’s not easy. I do think he will be able to play regularly for this club but he just needs to be calm</p>

Sometimes it’s not easy but it’s good to have someone who won’t let you slacken off’. To know that, if you stay, you are going to fight for all the titles over the next 10 years gives you the willingness and ambition to stay; to try to do your best to be important at the club.

I think the response from Mendy was clear after that. They are joking all the time. Maybe what I say as advice is to hide social media, if something happened it would be a mistake.

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva suggested <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were lucky to only be losing 3-0 at half-time in Tuesday’s EFL Cup semi-final first-leg]</b> I think we could have gone to half-time winning by four or five because we missed a few chances, then the second half was very hard for us. They started pressing higher, trying to control the game and getting on the ball. We got a bit tired, but I think overall it was a good performance and we’re happy with this win. It’s never easy to come here to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> against one of the best sides in England, in Europe, and to win 3-1. When you play a derby and you play Man United, you cannot always win. We were disappointed because losing at home <b>[to United in December]</b> is not normal for us. Coming here, in a way it makes it up to our fans, who once again were unbelievable in helping us get this win<br /><br /><b>[Silva relished the extra attacking freedom and gave his coach’s tactical tweak his seal of approval]</b> I enjoyed it a lot, especially because we won and because it worked.

It doesn’t matter who he’s playing against and his mentality and character is the best thing about him.<br /><br />The first time I played with Bruno, we were 18 years old so my first game for Portugal at Under-19s was also Bruno’s first game for Portugal. Then we played together for the U21s, the national team and now we’re both in Manchester so it’s great. We’re rivals but it’s good to have him here. Changing is always complicated, you have to adapt to the way your new team plays, your team-mates, the way the manager wants to play, sometimes new systems.

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have been a ‘huge disappointment’ in the Premier League]</b> The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> has been a huge disappointment to be so far from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now we have to fight for the second position. It hurts a lot because when you start a season, you always want to go for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it’s the main competition and the most important for the fans. So it’s very disappointing, no one expected us to be this far from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in January or February so it’s something that we need to learn from. We need to understand what failed and how we can solve it<br /><br />I don’t think it’s how you defend or attack, I think it’s a mix of plenty of things. I think little details make a huge difference and if you look at us this season, all the little details never went our way. It’s not an excuse, we should’ve done better, and we are very disappointed in ourselves. But if you look at the injuries we’ve had, the VAR decisions that never went our way - and I’m not complaining, but in football, it sometimes goes your way and sometimes not. We create 30 chances per game and we score one or two goals. The opponents, they go close once or twice and they score one or two goals as well<br /><br />The way we play is the same way we’ve been playing over the last few seasons. If you look at the stats, we’re still the team that creates the most chances and scores the most goals. But in the important moments, we’ve not been as lucky as in the past seasons. We always concede in the last minute, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> always scores in the last minutes and these little details in football make the difference. The team just has to try and find a balance<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> haven’t surprised me, they’re one of the best sides in the world and we knew they were going to be strong this season.

In the Champions League, we finished first of the group and now we have a tough game <b>[against Real Madrid]</b>.<br /><br />The Champions League is a competition we’ve never won and I’m not going to hide that everyone at this club wants to win it. I’m very excited <b>[about playing Real Madrid]</b>. When you’re a young kid, you dream of playing in these competitions and playing against the best. If we deserve to win the Champions League, you have to really deserve it, you have to beat these teams to win it. It’s tough but it’s something that we’re prepared for.<br /><br />People are used to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> winning everything. If we look at the last two and a half seasons, there’s not a team in Europe that has won as many trophies as us. It’s not that because we’re not winning one title, the team goes from being one of the best to an average team. If we win the cups and the Champions League, it’s the best season this club have ever seen so there is still a lot to fight for knowing that we still have a difficult task ahead of us</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> worth every penny, and he’s just getting started!]</b> I’m not surprised how well he has started because he’s a great player. He’s a good friend of mine, I’ve played with him since we were in the Under-19s with Portugal. His qualities? He has a great work rate, very intelligent and he’s a guy who arrives very well in the box, scores a lot of goals, gets assists. He’s a crucial player and is showing that in the first few weeks. I’m happy for him, he’s had a great start. He asked me about Manchester and I said what I thought was right. It’s a great club for him, it’s a great opportunity and he’s doing great. I’m happy for him because he’s a friend, but I just don’t want him to win on Sunday. I want to beat him obviously<br /><br /><b>[When asked why no top clubs had snapped up Fernandes before this season]</b> I don’t know why. He was quite expensive and sometimes it’s not easy to get a player like Bruno because teams always demand so much money for players like him. But I think he’s worth the value that they paid and he’s showing it right now. I think the people should stay calm though. Even though he’s a great player it’s just the beginning. People should give him space to work and to do his job well. It’s a good start and hopefully he can keep going that way. But he can handle the pressure, yes. He was Sporting’s captain for more than two seasons and he was the leader there - and I think he can be a leader at Man United as well<br /><br />It’s a very special game for the players, and for the fans and we want to give them this win. We know how difficult it is to play there. When you play against a team like <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> with their fans, the history and everything, it’s always special to play them. A derby is always a special game, requires pressure and passion from the fans. We are used to playing big games and these are the games we like to play</p>

Possession is important in a way but does not dictate if you play well or not. We did not control the game as we should have and maybe from the perspective of people watching the game, we had more possession but they had the more clear chances. A bad performance. I don’t think it will affect performances in the Champions League. It is not acceptable to come here and lose 2-0.</p>

He wants to win more Champions Leagues, he wants to win more titles with Portugal, he wants to win more leagues, more individual trophies, he wants more goals. I think what is annoying about him, in a way, is that in a training session, you play a game, and it is 1-1. The manager says whoever scores wins, and it is always him. It is not only in the games.

I always have one thing in my mind, I say ‘Bernardo, if one day you are not feeling confident about something, just look to your left side and right side’.
