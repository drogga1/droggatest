  <p><b>[Eusebio says My record better than Ronaldo’s]</b> It saddens me because you can’t make that comparison. It’s a mistake. I played around 60 games to score my 41 goals. Now, after all these years, someone else has scored that many goals, but obviously that happens today because it’s easier to play against some opponents. I never played against Lichtenstein or Azerbaijan</p>

  <p><b>[Eusebio on the very best moments of his time at the top of the game]</b> When we played <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and won 5-3 it was soaking wet and the ball weighed a kilo. It didn’t have a brand. Consider the boots; there was no personalised footwear. Back then, it was all heart</p>

  <p><b>[The night Eusebio’s <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> ended <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s European Cup dream]</b> I saw <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> beat Dukla <b>[4-2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals]</b> and I believe all round that they are better than us. We must win by at least three goals for safety. Our problem is how to achieve those goals</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a>, as we all know, covered the whole pitch. Played on the left, on the right, in the middle. He never stopped running and he had a very powerful shot and scored a lot of great goals. I have many more good than bad memories from my career, but some of the bad memories come from when I crossed paths with <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a>. It was <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a> who spoiled my day in the World Cup semi-final of 1966 and later the European Cup final of ‘68, but I’ve forgiven him and we are still good friends now. He’s a real English gentleman</p>
