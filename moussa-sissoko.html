  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko spent much of the 2018-19 season defying critics and delighting <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans in equal measure. Sissoko had a difficult start at the club following his £30 million move from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> in the summer of 2016]</b> I’m very happy and proud. That means the fans like what I’m doing and like me as a player and a person. They know me well. I’ve always tried to give my best for the team, even when it wasn’t easy, always tried to focus on my job and help everyone. I’m doing well now and they are very happy for me. It’s good for a player to feel the confidence of the players, the coaching staff and the fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko claims he never considered quitting <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> despite feeling hurt by team selections by <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> that affected his international career]</b> Not being at the 2018 World Cup was of course a disappointment, but not an end in itself. I was aware of having a complicated year with my <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> club. The coach’s choices hurt me, but it’s the law of football. The only thing to do was to redouble efforts. To abandon everything would have been a descent into hell. I did not want to stay on a failure. I never thought of leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it gave me even more the desire to do well. I have a winning mind, it has been like that throughout my career. I do not make any noise, I do not come in the media to say that I had to play<br /><br /><b>[He has found his home in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s midfield this season]</b> Perhaps I have never felt as strong as today. I am comfortable, fulfilled, confident. It is often said that the best form of a player is between 28 and 30 years old. I did not believe it before, but I have certainly had my best season since playing football. I must continue to ride this wave. Last season, I played 95 per cent of the games as an axial midfielder. This is where I have the most success, where I express myself best. I have assimilated our possession game. It took time, but I like it there a lot</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder Moussa Sissoko has signed a new four-year contract that will take him through until 2023 in north London]</b> I’m very proud to sign a new deal with the club. That means they believe in me and are happy with what I’m doing so I can give my best to the club for a long time. Hopefully everyone will be happy with my new contract, and of course my family and friends are very happy and proud because they know at the beginning it was tough for me. But I never gave up, I always believed in myself, I was trying to do my best even in the bad moments.<br /><br />I’ve learned a lot as a man and as a footballer. The talents of the players and coaching staff <b>[here]</b> are unbelievable so I’ve learned a lot from them, and as a person as well. We can achieve some good moments all together. I try to be <b>[a leader]</b>. I have a lot of experience now I’m 30 years old. It is always important to have something from the experienced players so that is what I’m trying to do. We’re all together in the same boat and if we want to have success together, you have to have the right person beside you. We know it will be hard <b>[to top last season]</b> but in football and life, everything is possible. You just have to believe in yourself and anything can happen</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko has urged his team-mates to turn <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> into a fortress this season]</b> Of course we are far, far behind the top four, but the season is long and we can still win a lot of games. It will not be easy but we know we have the qualities to do it. When we come back <b>[after the international break]</b> we will try to catch the teams in front of us and see where we are at the end of the season. We have to make our home a fortress. Normally we have to take most of the points at home against every team, but we have a bit of a problem with that. It is a shame for us because the fans are pushing us along with their support, but at the end we don’t win</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko sympathises with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> as ‘nothing works’ for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> star]</b> I see the stories about <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> in the newspaper or on TV. I wouldn’t say I’m shocked but the way I know him is totally different <b>[to that]</b>. This kind <b>[of thing]</b> happened to me as well. Sometimes people only see what ­happens on the pitch. Maybe you’re not playing well. That doesn’t mean you’re not trying to give everything. Sometimes you give everything and nothing works. Sometimes it’s because something has happened in your private life, so you’re not well. The thing to do is be yourself, stay focused on yourself, try to ignore what people are saying. The most important thing is having the confidence of your team-mates, the manager and the staff. So keep working and your quality will come back. That’s the only way to ­success again.<br /><br /><b>[He hopes to act as an inspiration to others, with current club colleague <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a> among those who need to remain patient and confident in their own ability]</b> I was proud to be given a new contract, especially because of how it was for me at the beginning at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. That means I deserve it because of my work. I stayed focused, I never gave up and that’s why the new contract came. When you get to 30, maybe it’s not what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> <b>[usually]</b> do, so I can only be happy. I’m a good example <b>[for Tanguy]</b>. If this kind of <b>[difficult]</b> situation happens with Tanguy, I will tell him to follow the same way. But at the moment there’s no reason to worry. He’s focused only on his work. He has a lot of injuries since he came but he’s doing well and this week he’s back with us <b>[in training]</b>. He reminds me of myself because when I came to England with <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> I couldn’t speak any English and it wasn’t easy</p>

We have objectives, fourth place is still doable. We’re going to do everything. At one point, we had a lot of games, injuries, important players missing.
