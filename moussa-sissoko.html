  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko has reflected on the worst season of his career after becoming a £30 million flop at Tottenham]</b> You can never be sure of anything. Once again, what I want is for everything to be clear. If the manager is no longer counting on me, if he thinks that other players are better, then he should say it.<br /><br />The idea is to be clear very early to allow, if I need to leave, for my agent to do good work … Even if everyone knows that I prefer England, I have never closed the door to any league. We will see what the offers are, but Ligue 1 continues to be attractive. We have seen this year with PSG and Monaco but also teams like Nice, Lyon and Marseille. We will analyse everything and try to make the best choice.<br /><br />I fell from a high point this season. Even though I never thought I would play all the games, I was not expecting such a small amount of playing time. It was the worst season of my career even though as a team it was certainly the best, so it’s weird. We’ll talk with my agent to make the best decision. My goal is to go to the 2018 World Cup<br /><br /><b>[On Mauricio Pochettino]</b> I would like him to communicate better. I want a completely honest conversation to see what they plan to do, what they are seeing in terms of my future. From that moment on, everything will be clearer in my head</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko insists Tottenham have the quality to be Premier League title contenders]</b> Every season, this league becomes more difficult, but we have to stick together and play our game, and do the right things to try and hopefully get something at the end of the season. It won’t be easy because Liverpool are here, Chelsea are here, Manchester City and Arsenal are here and it will be a tough battle. But we have the quality to answer them.</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko considers Tottenham team-mate Harry Winks to be of the same profile as Steven Gerrard]</b> At our place, there is little Harry Winks. He is a very good player who reminds me of Steven Gerrard. I think he has the same profile. He is evolving. From day to day, we see him evolve, progress. He is confident. He is in the England team so that proves that he is a quality player. He is the young player that will explode in the years to come.<br /><br />I feel good in Tottenham. I am well settled. Everything’s going well for me. I am with my little family. They feel good about it. I think that’s the most important thing. You can tell me that each transfer window you hear my name, but I have always been good in my head. There will always be noises from outside but when you are solid in your head, when you know what you want and where you want to go, there is no need to worry about the future.<br /><br /><b>[He is contracted to Tottenham until 2021. Pressed on whether he expects to see out that deal]</b> If I say yes, I would be lying. If I say no, I would be lying too because in football everything goes fast. I can say no and then tomorrow something happens, the club wants to sell me or I want to leave. It’s hard to answer that question. I live from day to day. For the moment. I feel good and it is the most important thing. I try to keep moving forward and growing. We’ll see what happens in the future. But for now, I do not have the head elsewhere<br /><br />I do not know if I will go back to France or not. Will anyone want me in France? That’s the question. I do not know. I feel good in England. Since I started playing football, I always said that I hoped to play in England because it is the championship that corresponds most to my qualities, and I do not think I was wrong. We’ll see what happens later. I feel good and I hope to stay here for a very long time</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko believes a Premier League title triumph is possible for Spurs,]</b> We are not far. If people want to talk about Liverpool and Man City then it’s better for us. We can follow our way in. We will be like that. Under the radar, I like that - and try to win and see where we are. For me, I prefer that. It means we can just do our job. We will fight to the end and anything can happen. And, yes, I think we can win the league because we have a good team. There are 13 games to the end so there are a lot of points left. But each game will be massive and hopefully we can win every one of them.<br /><br />We can see that we are not far from winning something. It is only small details that we are missing. What are those small details? I don’t know but we need to find the solution. I think we are capable, we have the team to win, everything is here to win and we just need to keep working and fighting. That is the only way<br /><br />I am very happy with what I have done from the beginning of the season because I can say that I have come back from ‘far’. Everyone knows the first two years here were not easy for me and maybe it took some time to adapt with a new team but also a new style of football because when I was in Newcastle the system was totally different and even the culture of the manager was different. So it wasn’t easy. In my old teams I used to play every game and when you go to a new club and you don’t start you are disappointed. But you have to stay strong in your head and I was and people were here to help me gain confidence and work every day to succeed. I didn’t give up. In my head I knew I could do it here so it was just a case of working and take my chance, one day. Maybe it is my moment now<br /><br />I think people expected me to succeed straight away because I came here for a lot of money and because I had done well at the Euros in 2016 <b>[where he helped France to the final]</b>. But that did not happen. In football and also in life people want results straight away. Everyone wants to perform straight away but sometimes you can’t. You might need a week, a year, even two years. My time was the time I took and the past is gone. I can also say the level here is higher than it was at Toulouse and Newcastle, the competition for places greater and I have become a better player. Not just a better player, a better man</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko is happy at Tottenham]</b> My first season at Spurs was not easy. First of all, I signed on the last day of the transfer window. I did not have a pre-season and I did not know any players here, except Hugo <b>[Lloris]</b>. It was a different mentality, a different style of football. I tried my best but it was difficult to adapt with this team. Because I am someone with a strong mentality, I said I will keep working until I can do what I want. Maybe it took me some time to get here, but I am happy to have joined this club and happy to be here. When you come from a team where you are playing every game, to a team where you are not playing as much as you want, you always think whether you made a good choice or not. My agent was with me, my uncle, and we spoke every day. We agreed it was the best choice for me, I just needed to stay passionate and keep working because I have the quality to be a success here. When I see my situation now, I am happy to have followed that way.<br /><br />I am very happy in that role. We train a lot in that position and was happy with it. I was feeling better and better in games. I got more confidence from the games. I feel it is my natural position, even though I was playing out wide for Newcastle. From when I started playing football, my position was as a central midfielder. It is where I feel more comfortable. For different reasons, managers put me on the side. I feel more confident in the middle, and I know exactly what I have to do. For me, it is easier. I hope to improve and be a better player, but for now I am happy. I just need to keep working on every training session</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko is now a star turn at Tottenham and looking to down Arsenal]</b> My first impressions of English football were the Arsenal team under Arsene Wenger. All the French players were there - Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Patrick Vieira. My idol was Vieira. In the playground, I was Vieira. That is why I wanted to play in England. I was the same position, we have a similar style. He was a complete idol. It’s why, when I had the chance to come to Newcastle, I didn’t think twice. Now I am at a massive club in Tottenham<br /><br />I knew I could be a success here. I was unlucky in that I signed on the final day of the transfer window, so I did not have pre-season with the squad. I did not know the players very well. Everything was new. The level was bigger than my previous teams. It is normal to take time but they paid a lot of money for you, so they want results straight away. I wanted to play more. I used to play every game at Newcastle and Toulouse. I had to be really strong in the mind. Sometimes you have bad moments. I was left out of the World Cup last summer. It was hard. I was in touch with the players, supporting them. I watched it in London with my missus. I so wanted to be there. I just kept saying in my mind, ‘Keep working and I know it will be a success’. I listened to the manager Mauricio Pochettino. I am so happy I did not give up. It is never too late</p>

But it is not over. We know the quality that Son has, we know what he adds to this team. It will be great to have him back and hopefully he can score some goals because he’s scored a lot this year. But with him or without him we’ll go there <b>[to Amsterdam]</b> with the same mentality and try to come back with qualification. We want to go to the final - it would be something amazing for all of us. One more game to play. It won’t be easy but, all together, I am sure we can do it</p>

  <p><b>[Sissoko calls on Spurs to bounce back against Ajax after nightmare seven days]</b> We don’t have to think too much <b>[about the Bournemouth defeat]</b> because another game is coming on Wednesday and we have to make sure we are ready for that game. It is not every week we can play in this type of match. Even away we still have a chance to win and we have to believe in ourselves. That is what we will try to do. I think this week will be the biggest of the season for us. We have to be positive in our mind and not think too much. We know we have quality, we know we can beat these two teams but we to show it on the pitch. I’m sure we will do it.<br /><br />If you are in the semi-finals of the Champions League and the next season you are not in the competition, it will be a bit painful, but I don’t think about that. I’m sure in my head, like everyone, that we will be in the Champions League next season and for that we have to play a massive game on Wednesday to try to go to the final and beat Everton. I think the good thing is Ajax is a team that likes to play. I don’t think they will stick together at the back, sit at the back and only try to defend. I think they will try to play, try to score and, for us, we know we have to score as early as possible</p>
