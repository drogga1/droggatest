Pochettino sorry for tough tackles in friendly that saw Moussa Sissoko appear to stamp on Dan James. United’s new winger Daniel James seemed to be targeted by Tottenham throughout. The Red Devils beat his Spurs side 2-1 in the International Champions Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele’s agent has insisted that his client will stay at Barcelona despite receiving offers from several big European clubs]</b> I wanted to clarify firmly and definitively the situation of Ousmane Dembele. He has not planned on leaving FC Barcelona even for a moment. This is the course of action set for several months now and no element is or will be likely to make us deviate from it. Ousmane feels perfectly well within the club and he remains determined to impose himself in the long term. Despite the offers of several big European clubs, Ousmane is convinced he wants to be part of the biggest of them and that everything is set for him to flourish. Unfortunately, his injury has temporarily stopped him during his drive to have a great and beautiful season. But this will not affect his success and his will to return as soon as possible. He is Barcelona and he will stay 1000 per cent with the will to honour the colours of the club!</p>

  <p><b>[Moussa Sissoko says Ousmane Dembele does not care if Neymar joins Barcelona]</b> He doesn’t feel at all threatened. When you play at Barca, you expect to be in competition there. Neymar or another, he does not care about that, he only cares about what he has to do<br /><br />We received shows of interest from big clubs. But we were clear on the fact that he did not want to leave. I told them from the start that he wants to succeed in Barcelona. The door is closed, and Paris or any other club are aware of our intentions. Will he be at Barca this season? In our plans, he wants to stay and all his work is towards that. We are working on that</p>

There is no chance he will leave. He wants to and will succeed at Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[Sissoko doubled down on his statements where he asserted that sporting success took precedent over salary for his client]</b> I repeat for the 20th time, Ousmane will stay and succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. The deal would have been better financially in Paris for Ousmane and for me, his agent, but money is not the most important thing, it is success in his career. We are not scared of adversity, Ousmane has battled his entire life to get where he is today and he will keep fighting to achieve his ambitions. A lot of people say to players that they only think about money and here is the proof that they don’t, the most important thing is not the financial aspect but rather his wellbeing and sporting success<br /><br /><b>[Sissoko also dismissed reports that rumours of misbehaviour and the forward’s shaky injury history caused <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> to hesitate over his signing]</b> <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> are not the problem, the only thing that matters is that Ousmane does not want to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he feels good there and he knows what he has to do to triumph in this great club.

I was aware of having a complicated year with my <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> club. The coach’s choices hurt me, but it’s the law of football. The only thing to do was to redouble efforts. To abandon everything would have been a descent into hell. I did not want to stay on a failure. I never thought of leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it gave me even more the desire to do well. I have a winning mind, it has been like that throughout my career.

I am comfortable, fulfilled, confident. It is often said that the best form of a player is between 28 and 30 years old. I did not believe it before, but I have certainly had my best season since playing football. I must continue to ride this wave. Last season, I played 95 per cent of the games as an axial midfielder. This is where I have the most success, where I express myself best. I have assimilated our possession game. It took time, but I like it there a lot</p>

Hopefully everyone will be happy with my new contract, and of course my family and friends are very happy and proud because they know at the beginning it was tough for me. But I never gave up, I always believed in myself, I was trying to do my best even in the bad moments.<br /><br />I’ve learned a lot as a man and as a footballer.

I try to be <b>[a leader]</b>. I have a lot of experience now I’m 30 years old. It is always important to have something from the experienced players so that is what I’m trying to do. We’re all together in the same boat and if we want to have success together, you have to have the right person beside you. We know it will be hard <b>[to top last season]</b> but in football and life, everything is possible. You just have to believe in yourself and anything can happen</p>

It will not be easy but we know we have the qualities to do it. When we come back <b>[after the international break]</b> we will try to catch the teams in front of us and see where we are at the end of the season. We have to make our home a fortress.

I wouldn’t say I’m shocked but the way I know him is totally different <b>[to that]</b>. This kind <b>[of thing]</b> happened to me as well. Sometimes people only see what ­happens on the pitch. Maybe you’re not playing well. That doesn’t mean you’re not trying to give everything. Sometimes you give everything and nothing works. Sometimes it’s because something has happened in your private life, so you’re not well. The thing to do is be yourself, stay focused on yourself, try to ignore what people are saying. The most important thing is having the confidence of your team-mates, the manager and the staff. So keep working and your quality will come back.

That means I deserve it because of my work. I stayed focused, I never gave up and that’s why the new contract came. When you get to 30, maybe it’s not what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> <b>[usually]</b> do, so I can only be happy. I’m a good example <b>[for Tanguy]</b>. If this kind of <b>[difficult]</b> situation happens with Tanguy, I will tell him to follow the same way. But at the moment there’s no reason to worry. He’s focused only on his work. He has a lot of injuries since he came but he’s doing well and this week he’s back with us <b>[in training]</b>. He reminds me of myself because when I came to England with <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> I couldn’t speak any English and it wasn’t easy</p>

It’s possible that he will never show his quality at the club. He is still a player with huge potential, but I think this summer could be the right opportunity for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to sell or even exchange him for a player they’re chasing already. He’s been unlucky with injuries, but he might also have tried to give more at some moments. Things haven’t gone according to expectations and he might be able to revive his career at another club where he will feel more confident to play at his best. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> seem to be trying to sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>, so Dembele will probably struggle to get in the first team next season. Additionally, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would need to reduce its squad and earn some money if they really want to succeed in bringing in their current targets. To sign new players, others must leave</p>
