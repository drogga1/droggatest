  <p><b>[German FA boss Grindel admits mistakes over Ozil-Erdogan photo scandal. he should have made it unequivocally clear that]</b> any form of racial hostility will not be accepted or tolerated <b>[by himself or the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>]</b> under any circumstances. The <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>’s values are also my own; diversity, solidarity, anti-discrimination and integration are all values and beliefs that are close to my heart. We live our values. That is why we, as the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>, questioned the photo with Turkish president Erdogan<br /><br />I very much regret that this has been misused for racist slogans. Looking back, as president I should been unequivocally clear about something that is a given for me as a person and for us all as an association: any form of racial hostility will not be accepted or tolerated under any circumstances.<br /><br />That was the case for <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jerome Boateng</a>, that is the case for <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>, and it is the same for any player at grassroots level that has a migrant background<br /><br />I won’t pretend that this personal criticism hasn’t affected me, but I feel even more sorry for my colleagues, the many volunteers at grassroots level and the staff at the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>, who have been linked with racism. It’s something I firmly reject for both the association and myself personally</p>
