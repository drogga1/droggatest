  <p><b>[DFB president Reinhard Grindel is pleased Joachim Low has decided to stay on]</b> It was a question of respect in regard to giving the head coach a few days to himself after such an intensive tournament so he could analyse what happened in peace. However, we never doubted that he would be determined to continue his journey and work towards our main goal of defending the World Cup in 2018. I stand by what I said before and during the tournament: Jogi Low is the best coach for this team. He has our unconditional faith and we are confident that we can continue to play successful football in the future with him at the helm..</p>

  <p><b>[Reinhard Grindel insists that no matter what happened, the German football federation would honour its new deal with Low]</b> We decided before the World Cup for the contract extension, because we believe that the change that will take place after the World Cup, regardless of the outcome of the tournament, cannot be done better by anyone other than Jogi Low.</p>

  <p><b>[DFB president Reinhard Grindel has insisted that Low is the best man for the job despite World Cup humiliation]</b> We had a very open and trusting exchange in which we raised many points. We are all firmly convinced that with Jogi Low we have a national coach who will analyse very carefully, take the right steps and lead our team back on the road to success. It would be premature, however, to demand a comprehensive analysis just days after such a tournament.</p>

  <p><b>[German FA boss Grindel admits mistakes over Ozil-Erdogan photo scandal. he should have made it unequivocally clear that]</b> any form of racial hostility will not be accepted or tolerated <b>[by himself or the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>]</b> under any circumstances. The <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>’s values are also my own; diversity, solidarity, anti-discrimination and integration are all values and beliefs that are close to my heart. We live our values. That is why we, as the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>, questioned the photo with Turkish president Erdogan<br /><br />I very much regret that this has been misused for racist slogans. Looking back, as president I should been unequivocally clear about something that is a given for me as a person and for us all as an association: any form of racial hostility will not be accepted or tolerated under any circumstances.<br /><br />That was the case for <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jerome Boateng</a>, that is the case for <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>, and it is the same for any player at grassroots level that has a migrant background<br /><br />I won’t pretend that this personal criticism hasn’t affected me, but I feel even more sorry for my colleagues, the many volunteers at grassroots level and the staff at the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a>, who have been linked with racism. It’s something I firmly reject for both the association and myself personally</p>

  <p><b>[German FA president Reinhard Grindel says he is confident that the recent controversy stemming from Mesut Ozil’s racism allegations will not impact Germany’s Euro 2024 bid]</b> Everyone in the DFB and in UEFA knows me very well. I have very deep trust that they can put this into perspective, so I think there will be no influence on the bidding process.<br /><br />In the end, it has nothing to do with whether a player of ours has a migration background or not. If a German player would, in an election campaign, make a photo with, let’s say, a far right-wing politician in Germany, we would have the same debate and we in the DFB would react in the same way. We stand at the DFB for values: respect, tolerance, fair play, freedom of speech and freedom of press. This picture with Erdogan upset our fans, because their President Erdogan doesn’t stand for those values</p>
