These are kids we used to see, they used to come and watch us training, and I believe they learned a little bit of our skills, how we read the game. So, you know, we’re not surprised because I also trained with them when I used to train with the reserve team. It was always a moment for me to give away some skills, some knowledge, and they learnt really fast, really quick.

Being an ex-player from the club, it helps a lot because we’ve seen all these kids when we were training. So, you know, you have to give them a chance and when you do, they deliver. They’ve been performing. Of course, there will be maybe a lack of experience in big games like Champions League but I’m not worried. I’m really happy with the work that Frank is doing right now.

I was always writing music and dancing when I was trying to make it in football. It is great to release my first song. It is just a happy, dance song for everyone to listen to. I have always been inspired by the words in music, most specifically. My biggest influence is a French artist called Kery James. He is one of the best writers; he is like a poet. I also listen to Afrobeats and have African influences but the music I listen to is always in French, so French-African. I am attached to my African roots and I go home to visit my parents in Ivory Coast who still live there a lot. I hope to see my music recognised and to have a long career releasing a lot of music that brings people together and makes them dance<br /><br />He is very much my role model. I am proud to be Didier’s brother. He is an example through his achievements in football<br /><br />Off the pitch I have so many memories of Didier. I often think about the time when he played for Le Mans and we used to like going to this restaurant called Buffalo Grill. Our car broke down and we had to push it a long way to the restaurant. He went from pushing his own car to scoring a header and being a star in the Champions League. I find that inspiring. He signed for massive clubs like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I was there watching him in Germany in the Champions League final. That goal is a family souvenir that none of us will ever forget. In a way, me signing with E47 Records feels like signing with a football club.
