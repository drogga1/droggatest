In Italy, he did very well with a big club and now he has gone to England and he is doing even better. He has been fantastic.<br /><br /><b>[On Mohamed Salah]</b> I think he has got it in him.

  <p><b>[Belgium have a chance of going all the way at the 2018 World Cup with the form that Romelu Lukaku has shown]</b> I am still challenging him, for example, to get more goals for United next season than the 27 he got last season, and to get the Golden Boot at this World Cup, too. We do not always talk about work, though. I have been to see him at Belgium’s training camp in Moscow and we did not speak seriously then. I know his team-mates Eden Hazard, Marouane Fellaini and their assistant coach Thierry Henry as well, and it was nice to speak to them all about everything and nothing. It was just normal chat between friends, making jokes about players and watching Croatia’s win over Argentina at the same time. We were just having fun and it was clear that Romelu and the Belgium squad are in a good place, not just playing well and winning games. That is one of the reasons I am backing them to do so well at this tournament, and with Romelu in this sort of form, they definitely have a chance.<br /><br />Romelu is a player and person I have a special relationship with. I have known him for seven years, since he first came to Chelsea at the age of 18 in 2011, and we are really close. He is more than my very good friend, he is a kid I love and he is like my younger brother - someone I have always tried to help. When he was young he was very raw. Powerful and physical, yes - always. I always challenged him and told him that he needed to get leaner and he would be a different player - faster, and more agile at moving and turning. He has done that. When I look at the player he is now and the one he was seven years ago, there is a big difference. If you go through the different parts of his game, there is quality everywhere. As I said in my TV analysis after he scored twice against Tunisia, we have talked a lot about the runs he makes, the angles he takes and his footwork when he is through on goal. The short steps he took before he scored his first goal in that game were just like the ones a tennis player takes just before they hit the ball, and they give you more accuracy. That was great to see but, when I talked to him after Belgium had played Panama, we spoke about one of the chances he had and I told him what he could have done better in that situation than the touch he took with his left foot. Romelu explained he was trying to beat the defender but I said you need to focus on your first touch so it would have been better to control with your right and then get in front of the defender that way. He watched it again and said: ‘Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - you were right’. There is an example of how much he wants to learn. When you hear that, you can tell he is going to reach the top. He is not there yet, but he is almost there</p>

It wasn’t that long ago that I was a young kid, walking around in France. No one recognized me. No one knew who I was. And now, when I look around the locker room at my teammates, that’s who I see. Young versions of myself. I was once them. I joke with people that they need to give me the cup, so I can retire in peace. And that if I don’t get it, I’ll come back. But the truth is, this is my last season. And now the playoffs are here. That cup that <b>[Berke Bakay, the Governor of Rising FC]</b> texted me a photo of years ago is within sight. Maybe we win.

You get criticism because you set a standard of winning, winning and winning and now you’re not winning or having the same results. He is still <b>[at Manchester United]</b>. You have to look at all the managers who were at Manchester United the last few years. Being manager after Sir Alex Ferguson is not easy and the finances that they had then are not the same as what they have now. People only pay attention to the best and he’s one of the best and that’s why he gets all of this.<br /><br />I think he’s taking the challenge, because it’s a big challenge and if people criticise you then how can you enjoy it? It’s tough. After all, he’s human. He’s trying to change his approach and that’s what the best managers do and when things are not working you try to change it</p>

  <p><b>[Didier Drogba believes Eden Hazard has done enough to earn himself the status of Chelsea legend]</b> He has become more clinical. It comes with age as well. He is very efficient and I am really happy to see that. He is leading the team, carrying the team on his shoulders and he is doing that well. He is someone who has got very high expectations of himself and his team-mates because he wants to win. Sometimes this pushes you to do a little bit more to do well because you want your team-mates to get to your level. This happens sometimes, but the more he plays in these big games, he reads the game better. He is a legend <b>[regardless of what happens]</b>, look at what he achieved in six years at the club. He won the league twice, won the FA Cup, won Player of the Year. We are talking about Eden Hazard. Please! He brought something that we hadn’t seen for such a long time. The closest I can bring to him if I compare, if I may, is <b>[Gianfranco]</b> Zola. The talent to dribble, to make the difference and dribble one-versus-one. That’s him..<br /><br />{On Davd Luiz]&lt;/b&gt; David is a great player. He is a fantastic player. I played with him a few years ago, and I really enjoyed playing with him. I enjoyed having him in my team because you know you are safe. Last year was a bit difficult for him, but the season before he was really good. I think it is a matter of confidence between you and the manager and how the feeling is going. Also injuries, last year it was difficult for him to recover, but now he is at his best. I am really happy for him. He and Cahill are really important to this team because they are the last ones who won the Champions League. They are the core of this team. It is not for me to decide <b>[on a contract renewal]</b>. It is more down to him and the club to agree on this. Everyone at the club loves David, but if he stays at the club, I will be happy. He is not only bringing happiness to the club, but he also is now one of the faces of the club, and he is a very good player, he is performing right now, so if it was up to me <b>[I would sign him]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[On Mohamed Salah and Kevin de Bruyne]</b> When you see those two players, you are very happy to see the way they improved and became leaders in their own teams. Mo, I am really happy for him. It is going to be an interesting title race, really interesting. They are two different times. Mo wasn’t playing much. Now they compare to the guy six or five years later, who has improved and he is playing games every weekend, every game. So, of course, he is going to score goals. The guy is talented, we saw that in Chelsea, so I am not surprised. We saw it in training, but it was difficult. We had Eden Hazard. You have <b>[other guys]</b>. There was a lot of competition for places. That’s football also. Credit to him, when he left he proved to everyone that he is a great player. That’s what I like about him. He left, he didn’t succeed at Chelsea. He went to Italy, to play, get some more minutes, comes back to the Premier League and now he is killing it. I think for Kevin, the same thing. He was really young, and in the team, we had all these big names. He decided to go and play. In football, it is straightforward, the more you play, the better you become. The more you can understand the game, the more you can read the game and become confident. That’s exactly what happened with him. When you have a manager like Guardiola who is helping him to understand and read the game faster, wow, he has become a different player. I don’t know, but it is going to be very interesting. I am going to follow it to the end. There will be more things happening for sure.<br /><br />Because there are many options. When you play 20 years of professional football, you meet a lot of people and make a lot of contacts. This gives you opportunities for life after football. This is something that I was always interested in, to be able to own a team or go into something different. People expected me to be a sports director or stay in football. I am in football but in a different way. That’s very exciting to see the other side of the game. I have been honoured to be named Chelsea and Yokohama ambassador, I have been travelling around and going to Asia to promote the club, and also our sponsor Yokohama too. That’s what I have been doing with the club. I have been taking care of my own business too, travelling. I have been travelling a lot. A lot, a lot. So I haven’t even had time to go and watch the games live at Stamford Bridge. And taking care of my foundation, which takes a lot of time. I am really happy</p>

These are kids we used to see, they used to come and watch us training, and I believe they learned a little bit of our skills, how we read the game. So, you know, we’re not surprised because I also trained with them when I used to train with the reserve team. It was always a moment for me to give away some skills, some knowledge, and they learnt really fast, really quick. So once again, I’m not surprised with what I’ve seen <b>[with Abraham]</b>.<br /><br />I think <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is focusing on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and it happens that he needs to work on young players, to give them a chance. Being an ex-player from the club, it helps a lot because we’ve seen all these kids when we were training. So, you know, you have to give them a chance and when you do, they deliver. They’ve been performing. Of course, there will be maybe a lack of experience in big games like Champions League but I’m not worried. I’m really happy with the work that Frank is doing right now.

  <p><b>[Meet Jo Drogba: The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend’s musician brother]</b> I was a forward for Metz but I got a lot of injuries. I like to think I was a mix of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <b>[Kylian]</b> <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> rather than like Didier<br /><br />I am passionate about football and music. I was always writing music and dancing when I was trying to make it in football. It is great to release my first song. It is just a happy, dance song for everyone to listen to. I have always been inspired by the words in music, most specifically. My biggest influence is a French artist called Kery James. He is one of the best writers; he is like a poet. I also listen to Afrobeats and have African influences but the music I listen to is always in French, so French-African. I am attached to my African roots and I go home to visit my parents in Ivory Coast who still live there a lot. I hope to see my music recognised and to have a long career releasing a lot of music that brings people together and makes them dance<br /><br />He is very much my role model. I am proud to be Didier’s brother. He is an example through his achievements in football<br /><br />Off the pitch I have so many memories of Didier. I often think about the time when he played for Le Mans and we used to like going to this restaurant called Buffalo Grill. Our car broke down and we had to push it a long way to the restaurant. He went from pushing his own car to scoring a header and being a star in the Champions League. I find that inspiring. He signed for massive clubs like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I was there watching him in Germany in the Champions League final. That goal is a family souvenir that none of us will ever forget. In a way, me signing with E47 Records feels like signing with a football club. As a fan, you get inspired and it is the same in the family</p>
