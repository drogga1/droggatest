  <p><b>[Speaking of the six RFYS kids being selected for the trial camp]</b> We are extremely glad to scout some raw talent from RFYS matches at Maharashtra and Kochi. The important aspect about RFYS’ efforts is that more options are being provided to the Indian National team coaches for selection. This is also a huge opportunity for the scouted boys to be at trials under the supervision of Head Coach, Stephen Constantine. It will help them grow as professional footballers.</p>

  <p><b>[Abhishek Yadav says parallel leagues would benefit the players immensely]</b> In my opinion and this is something which I had mentioned last year as well when the roadmap for Indian football was introduced, that leagues running parallely would have benefit the players. We have to work on a structure where there are several opportunities for players. I am sure the AIFF and IMG-Reliance have kept the same in mind and come up with this proposal which is aimed at taking Indian football to the next level. Only through healthy discussions and collective efforts can we progress as a nation.<br /><br />I do think that younger players will get more opportunities. In fact, the AIFF and their partners are working on several projects which will create multiple opportunities for a budding player. We will create a strong system so that no talent goes unnoticed</p>

  <p><b>[Abhishek Yadav says Sunny Dhaliwal is an Indian citizen now]</b> He has an Indian passport but also holds a Canadian citizenship card given that he was born there. Having a player of that height in Sunny is a bonus and with the proper training and infrastructure provided to him, I am sure he sees his future in India. As a player, he wants to be a future star of the senior national men’s team and being a part of this U-17 World Cup at home will go a long way in him establishing himself as a top prospect.<br /><br />Contrary to Sunny, Namit was born in India and his parents shifted to the United States when he was a toddler. Namit always had an Indian passport so it was never much difficult to draft him in</p>

  <p><b>[ON World Cup U17]</b> The World Cup is all about involving every Indian, not just in India but across the world. The idea is to provide an opportunity. If you have the talent, we would give you a chance to play for the national team. I am very pleased that the initiative which was approved by the AIFF and helped us get at least two players into the Under-17 World Cup squad has caught the attention of the Sports Ministry. So much so that our honourable Prime Minister has launched the National Talent Search Portal.</p>
