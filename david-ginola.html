  <p><b>[David Ginola reveals he has flaws and that’s why he plays for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> People always expect more from me than other players, something different, something special, but at the end of the day, thank God, I do have some weaknesses in my game. If I was perfect I would not be playing for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, I would be in a team like Milan or Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane should stay at Spurs]</b> Harry Kane should stay at Spurs. Spurs need Harry Kane to stay if they are to win the Premier League next season. That’s very important. Tottenham had a great season and finished runners-up last year. They need to keep their best assets if they want to win anything in the next few years, and Harry Kane, along with the likes of Dele Alli, is one of their best assets.<br /><br />If <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku would cost around £100m, I think it would be similar for Kane, in the same region of money. Some years ago we were talking about player value - remember when Gareth Bale left Spurs to join Real Madrid for £90-odd million, and that was massive. But now you have a few players worth this kind of money. When you think about strikers who can regularly score 20-25 league goals per season, you need to put the money on the table</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe should ignore interest from Real Madrid and the Premier League and spend another year at Monaco]</b> Mbappe has everything, already, at a very young age. He was very consistent for Monaco last season, and that was probably the biggest surprise. We knew of his quality, but he was surprising us every week with technique, his skill, his power and his pace … and I think the best is yet to come. There have been instances in the past with Anthony Martial moving to Manchester United and honestly, staying another season at Monaco will probably be a good thing for him, just for him to settle at the top level a little bit more.<br /><br />Sometimes you see young players leaving their home to go somewhere bigger and they didn’t succeed because it’s too complicated and it’s too much pressure. Kylian Mbappe seems to have the right people around him. His dad and his agent are good advisors, so I guess he’s going to make the right choice. But the thing is, when there is so much money on the table it’s not only about you, the club would be thinking twice about it. Apparently they want to put a lot of money on the table to keep him for another year, so we have to wait and see.<br /><br />We’re talking about Monaco. It’s a great city to live, but it’s not the biggest stadium around and a player like him would have interest in playing for Real Madrid or in the Premier League - for big clubs in big competitions. Monaco won the league this season and they did great in the Champions League, but Mbappe has so many opportunities in front of him</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane is not capable of doing things like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo do with a football]</b> The main problem with Harry Kane is, when he is not on the goal sheet, his impact on the game with his team is not as relevant as what it was before. If he doesn’t score, he doesn’t have the same impact upon the team<br /><br />You can’t put Harry Kane on the same level … it’s impossible! Because when it comes to talking about skills, skills are something you learn. The talent of scoring goals and the talent to be able to do things with the football are different. If you take <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona, Ronaldinho … they were the most skillful players around - they could do things with the football other professional players could only dream about. Harry Kane is not capable of doing things like Messi and Ronaldo do with a football, in terms of his quick feet</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial may search for another club this summer]</b> The main reason Anthony Martial is not in the squad is that you need to be a regular in your club before becoming a regular in your national team. <b>[Didier]</b> Deschamps has so many options and choices - strikers like Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann who have been consistently good for France - that it’s not as if he has to be in there if he’s not playing. Players like Martial need to play and score goals for the confidence, they need to be a regular. If he is not a regular at Manchester United he will probably search for another club and find one if he wants to. But I think Manchester United is a great club for him and it’s up to him to give more in training and in games. If Jose Mourinho doesn’t play him more regularly he probably thinks it’s because he doesn’t give his best all the time. I don’t see a manager like Mourinho not playing a player who can make him win games. It doesn’t work like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea are playing Kante in the wrong position]</b> Kante in the French team plays right in the middle. When you have a quality player like Kante, you play him in the middle. That is where he is best. For the French team he had a magnificent World Cup. We don’t talk much about N’Golo Kante because he’s very modest and very humble. I love him. If you take him away from the French team, it doesn’t look the same. This position in modern football is the key position. If I was a manager tomorrow my first thought would be ‘who is going to play this position?’. For me, Chelsea are wrong to play Kante in the position he is in. They are wrong. Kante in that position is not good.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has been likened to Manchester United and England’s former free-kick specialist David Beckham after netting a memorable strike against Watford]</b> He has everything. He’s a fast thinker. I like players who take a risk when they do things. Every time he has the ball he’s going to create something, something will happen. He has talent, pure talent. <b>[That is]</b> one of the greatest positions, David Beckham had that great position when he was kicking the ball. The balance is absolutely fantastic.</p>

  <p><b>[David Ginola has said that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have all the parts in place to become a European powerhouse]</b> Every single person now realizes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are one of the clubs to take into consideration. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have got every bits and pieces to be a great club. They have a great training centre, a great stadium and now they have a great team. The combination of <b>[chairman]</b> <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>, the club itself, <b>[manager Mauricio]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, the players makes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> what they are now on the planet of football - one of the greatest clubs around. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has not spent a penny in the last year-and-a-half, probably the only team that have not spent a lot of money on players. This is the reward for stability, players getting to know each other in training, this is how you get results<br /><br /><b>[In addition to praising <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>’s long-term vision, the 52-year-old, credited the Argentine for his crucial intervention at half-time in Wednesday’s game.

This is why <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is a great manager, because he can see when the team is not performing well and he has the ability to change the team in a second. When Llorente went on all the lights went on as well - Son <b>[Heung-min]</b>, <b>[Dele]</b> <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a>, <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> and Lucas Moura<br /><br />It was the first time in the Champions League this year you saw <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> struggling.

  <p><b>[Ginola comes to <a href="eric-dier.html">Dier</a>’s defence after <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fan row]</b> There are times when you think about it afterwards and you realise: ‘I shouldn’t do that’. You think about <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>. There is a bit of regret. When you are under pressure, it is difficult to contain your mental side. We are human beings. We are footballers. We have to behave. Try to do the best, say the best things, always be accurate when you do things. But we are humans. Sometimes you go beyond things you normally wouldn’t do. It is a duty as a footballer, a duty towards the kids, towards people in general. You have to think twice, think before acting. That is the hardest thing to do.<br /><br />Yes, it is a difficult situation. The worst-case scenario for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> was to play the final of the Champions League last year. For me. Because it was great for the club, great for the fans, great for everyone. But it gives you a stage, puts you up there that you are not really there yet. We think about other clubs who have been there year-in, year-out. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> just suddenly appeared to play in the final of the competition against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br />You become a team that people have to watch and expect results, expect great things and don’t forget the last few years <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have struggled to get trophies. That was the problem for <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, who did a great job. But on the other hand, he wasn’t winning anything. People were complaining. You have play in the final of the Champions League and you become better, higher, so once you start losing games, people say: ‘What is going on?’ We played the final of the Champions League, this year we will struggle to finish in the top 10 teams<br /><br />That is probably the main issue. They are too quick in the final of the Champions League. You have to win things in your home country first before going abroad and winning trophies. It’s all about expectation. When you have been playing good and last year in the few games in the Champions League, they had been very lucky - reaching this sort of dream - playing in the final of the Champions League for the fans, for the players, for the club.<br /><br />They started the season thinking we have to do better. Better is what? Winning at least one trophy? A domestic cup. Or the league. This is my philosophy. That is why it went wrong when you start the season, have one bad result, it comes to your mind. People start to think: ‘What is going on?’ We are not playing the same way. Are the players concerned the same way as they were last year? This is football. It’s about managing teams, players. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have everything. They have a fantastic stadium, a training facility which is amazing, some of the best fans in the country. But now they need to have a team consistent enough to be playing at the top level year-in, year-out</p>

  <p><b>[David Ginola says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> can still get better]</b> He is a young player and people are expecting a lot from him because he is very talented. <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> said he was the next <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> so there’s a lot on his shoulders at 20 years old.<br /><br />There’s so much pressure, so much responsibility and sometimes you have to step back and look back. When you are 20, you are still a kid. He has massive things in front of him. Is he mentally prepared enough to face all the demands around him? That’s a different story.<br /><br />He has got everything. He is an amazing player. The goal he scored (against <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> on March 4) was just amazing, running from the halfway line. There’s only a few players capable of that. He can do that. The only thing missing is being more consistent.<br /><br />He can do it five or six times a game and sometimes he doesn’t. He can be frustrating to watch because he is capable of more. He is sometimes just staying on the side and walking. He doesn’t need to leave <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and he is very well in France</p>
