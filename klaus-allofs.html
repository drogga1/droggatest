  <p><b>[Werder Bremen Manager Klaus Allofs Satisfied With Champions League Draw]</b> For a number of reasons, we had hoped to play the first leg away from home - in particular because of the construction work going on at the stadium, but it’s also a sporting challenge. Sportingly that would have been the same for any of the teams in the draw. We have experience of just how difficult these games can be from past meetings with Basel and Zagreb<br /><br /><b>[Allofs was cautious heading into the clash with <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>]</b> This game will be similarly difficult, but I am sure that they won’t have celebrated in Genoa about being drawn against Werder Bremen</p>

  <p><b>[Furious Werder Bremen double their asking price to £25m for <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> after <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> go behind their back]</b> I am not aware of a new bid, that is not something I am able to confirm. I am, however, guessing that there might be news on that. I am prepared to receive a new bid. The facts are pretty clear. If a club is looking to sign Mesut to play <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League, then that club needs to make a decision before Wednesday. If <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> is a player of Werder Bremen on Wednesday, we are going to play him against <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>. It would be up to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to show up with the right answer to this all</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen’s Klaus Allofs has claimed that the Hanseaten have to play better if they are to be successfu]</b> The trend of the last couple of games is positive. However, we can and have to play better. I especially hope that we can play calmer and more poised. Best would be to improve right away on Wednesday in the Champions League game against Twente. We were a bit careless on the counter-attack against Freiburg. We made it too complicated. If we had used all of our chances we could have possibly won 5-1. But our way of playing would not have changed</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen’s sporting director Klaus Allofs was far from happy with his side’s performance against Twente]</b> This is a huge disappointment for everyone at Werder Bremen. The team’s morale will be quite low after this loss and we have to build up confidence again. We simply made too many mistakes throughout the match and you can’t afford that at Champions League level. You have to convert the chances you get or you will be punished for it. That’s exactly what happened. Twente were a very clever opponent and did a good job. The current situation in Group A is not a good one for Werder. Today’s result was a blow for us. We’re still confident that this team can get something from this group though</p>

  <p><b>[Klaus Allofs has revealed that Werder Bremen are currently short of funds, and will not make a big-name signing in January]</b> We do not have to the financial capacity to make a €4 million transfer. For me, it is crucial that the injured players come back. What we delivered was not enough quality</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen’s general manager Klaus Allofs has confessed that the club are not able to extend the contracts of their German internationals Tim Wiese and <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Per Mertesacker</a> at the current time]</b> We have told Tim that, because of financial reasons, we can’t extend his contract at the moment. We cannot make Tim or Per any offers currently. This does not mean that negotiations at a later date cannot be set up, though. The issue is not off the table, even during the season you can still get into a conversation.</p>

  <p><b>[Allofs frustrated by <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>’s financial muscle]</b> One thing is for sure, the last team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> get more money than <b>[<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> champions]</b> <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. This is the situation. But this is the big task for our football league - to get more money from television. We have to compete with that and hopefully we can<br /><br />I think we can say it is a good draw. There were groups that were much more difficult. We did well last season, we finished second in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and we won the cup, so we are very optimistic to go through to the next round. All the teams in our group have international quality. But it isn’t impossible to qualify for the next round<br /><br /><b>[On individual teams, Allofs is wary of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and respects the other two sides too]</b> I think <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is our main rival, but Eindhoven as well. Moscow knocked out Sporting, so that’s not so easy. We have to improve ourselves in comparison to our Europa League season last year. But I think it is manageable.

This can also be transferred to the VfL. We want to continue to make meaningful decisions and invest in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the job cuts being in other German cities, the citizens of Wolfsburg were worried for their families and their football club]</b> We will have to see where Volkswagen’s aims lie. Is it simply about the existence of a football club in Wolfsburg or is it about challenging for the top of the league?</p>
