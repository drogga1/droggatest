  <p><b>[Former coach Dirk Kunert says <a href="julian-brandt.html">Julian Brandt</a> can easily play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> if he reaches his full potential]</b> I don’t always have the feeling that he’s really playing at 100%, that he’s fully showing his potential. He can do much more, I’m sure of it. Sure, he plays for one of the best clubs in Germany and for the national team, but even before that I thought to myself from time to time: ‘Man, if he can reach 100%, a move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would be possible without any problems for Jule’. But he’s still young and has time to work on himself. If he continues to work as hard as he does now, I don’t see any limit for him<br /><br />He’s working harder than before because the level at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is higher than at Leverkusen and you have to work harder to be successful. I’m not saying he was lazy, he never was, but sometimes, when things weren’t going so well, you had to tickle him a bit and ask what’s wrong. Then he’d grab the ball and show off his skills. He’s a special guy, not one to shy away from responsibility or let his head drop, but just someone who likes to do his own thing. He’s a bit cheeky, but that’s a good thing, especially with attacking players<br /><br />He played mainly on the wings with us because his first touch was outstanding and he always passed his opponents quickly and finished on goal. But as the past few years have shown, he is a player who needs to play as a central midfielder. He loves the double passes, the chipped balls and even those back-heeled passes like last weekend against Schalke <b>[when he set up Thorgan <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>’s assist for <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a>]</b>. <b>[He is]</b> extremely clever, armed with an unbelievable understanding of space and time and the talent of making his team-mates look good</p>
