<blockquote>
  <p><b>[PKNS’ caretaker boss Adam Abdullah revealed his unusual employment status to the press]</b> Selangor are still Selangor. I was born in Selangor, as well as a former Selangor player myself. PKNS FC meanwhile have its own history and are already familiar to many. We want a PKNS team and a Selangor team to always be in the M-League, that’s the most important thing. Our academy is doing well. A number of our boys have represented Malaysia at the under 19 and 21 levels, and that’s proof of our youth development.<br /><br />Actually, I’m a Selangor State Development Corporation staff member, and my employment terms are different <b>[than those of a full-time head coach]</b>. It’s preferable for a better coach to take over at PKNS, and it’s possible for us to go far if we make some changes in the roster. I am aware that I’ve shouldered the caretaker coach role twice, but the management wants a more renowned head coach so a more solid side can be formed. Furthermore, it’s the team that is more important and not the head coach<br /><br />When I hanged up my boots, I was hired by the property sales department which oversees rental units. But I was then transferred to the sports development department and now the majority of my day-to-day role concerns football. In fact, I do a lot of rapport building with state agencies, by organising <b>[friendly]</b> matches with their sports teams, just so that the company’s dealings with the agencies can be done more smoothly</p>
