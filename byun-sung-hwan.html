<blockquote>
  <p>[Byun Sung-hwan played 31 A-League matches in the 2009-10 season and while the South Korean was rarely in the spotlight, he dominated the headlines after the grand final thanks to his decisive penalty in the shootout] During my 13 years as a professional player, my time in Sydney is definitely on the top of the list. I can say that it was a turning point for me to be part of the team winning a double title.<br /><br />I had already been in K League for 10 years and I thought that this would be my last chance as a professional player to go overseas. During that time, I had the opportunity to choose between a team in the United States and Sydney FC and chose the latter. Right before that season a new manager was signed [Lavicka] and there was one position left for an import player and I was lucky enough to get in<br /><br />[Extra time and a penalty shootout followed, and when Byun stepped up to take Sydney’s fifth penalty, the Sky Blues lead 3-2 and were on the verge of the club’s second championship] It is definitely one of the most memorable moments of my entire career. The head coach had given me the chance to decide when to kick and I chose to go last. It was a moment of truth. If I failed to score I would become the biggest villain of the team but if I succeeded I would become a hero. Thankfully I was able to score and be part of a historical moment for the club<br /><br />I’ve been constantly following the A-League and monitoring the results. I find it interesting to see how the league I have been part of develops and grows. I have been following Sydney and honestly believe that they have a high chance to win. I will cheer for them</p>
