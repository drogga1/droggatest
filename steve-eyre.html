<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sancho had to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, but <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> was always staying]</b> I think he <b>[Sancho]</b> has had to develop a little bit later. They both had impatient ambition but Phil was happy to stay in England at the club that he loves. You have to respect <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> for his impatient ambition and his will to go and create his own development path at the second best team in German football at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. His development has probably been worked on more than <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a>, who has the best natural talent I have ever seen. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> had to leave this country to get more TV attention and more 90 minute matches under his belt - but Phil’s talent was clearer from a younger age<br /><br /><b>[There had been suggestions in the past that the 20-year-old would need to spread his wings in order to follow the lead of Sancho]</b> Not once. Only through the press. There seems to be a hand in glove trust between the player and the club. There is a lot of trust between the player and the best head coach in the world. The manager has come out in his media duties to say he will get his minutes and say he’s going to be a great player. But the main person who has believed it is himself.</p>
