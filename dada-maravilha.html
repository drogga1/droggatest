  <p>[On Tite] I’m charmed by Tite’s humility. He called Gerson to talk, and now he has called in Zagallo, the most successful coach in Brazilian football. They spoke about what the Selecao did in 1970 side, which are rightly considered the greatest team in Brazil’s history. Tite is on the right track.</p>

  <p>[Dada hoping for a fit Neymar at the World Cup] I must admit that I am delighted, first of all because of the humility of Tite, who called on Gerson, that monster of a player, to chat, he called on Zagallo, the most successful coach in Brazilian history, and obviously he talked about football, what the 1970 team achieved, why it is considered the best team on earth. He is on the right track, the two training sessions that I saw were full of quick touches, I liked it a lot.<br /><br />The two are excellent but right now Jesus deserves it, but if Jesus slips up and Firmino comes in and shines it is Brazil that wins, they have two brilliant goal-scorers<br /><br />I saw him training, I am excited, at certain points he showed a few bruises so I am quite scared, everyone knows the problem is his right foot, one hit to his right foot could take him out of the game. I think he has to play like Tostao used to, moving quickly, bringing his team-mates in because he is right on the limit, he is extraordinary and nobody goes in on him to take the ball, they go in to hit him and hurt him. He has to move the ball along quickly. Brazil depend a lot on Neymar, he is 50 per cent of the team<br /><br />Pele and Zico, those two were the greatest, the best I have ever seen. I am a fan of Tostao, who for me is one of the best after Pele and Zico, but I have to talk about Romario too, he was excellent for me, Ronaldo was also very good but I’ll stick with Romario in attack<br /><br />That question is easy to answer, I could measure the two teams up but football is about who wins, that is a concept you cannot argue with. So for that reason 1970 was the greatest<br /><br />I am excited, Tite took over the Selecao at its lowest ebb and brought it back, he has stimulated the players and Brazil are considered favourites. For me the outright favourite is Germany, then Brazil, but there is nothing stopping Brazil from being champions. Tite has shown he is a clever guy, it’s not just his intelligence I like, but also his humility in acknowledging he has people close to him that can help. Gerson, Zagallo, the World Cup’s biggest winner. So I want to thank them for accepting Tite’s invitation and to thank him for recognising he could learn with them. We are always learning</p>
