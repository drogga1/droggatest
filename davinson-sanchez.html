  <p><b>[Colombia’s Davinson Sanchez ‘player of the year’ after 1st year at Dutch giants Ajax]</b> People in South America know <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> as a nice gateway to a good career in Europe. It is very flattering to be linked with a club like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. But I only just got here and I want to achieve something before making the next step. I am not thinking about it for now. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> are my main priority at this stage</p>

  <p><b>[Sanchez admits to having snubbed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> switch]</b> It’s true that I was always linked <b>[with Barcelona]</b>. There was an offer on the table, but you have to think about the conditions. I had just won the Libertadores and had to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s second team.<br /><br />Although I was sure that I would finish up in the first team, because I have a lot of confidence in me and my ability to achieve important things, I played 50 games at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <b>[that was]</b> what I needed<br /><br /><b>[Sanchez also claims to have spurned the opportunity to head for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> after speaking with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> head coach Mauricio Pochettino]</b> The first person I spoke with was <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and I had the chance to go to Italy, but Mauricio convinced me. He was a central defender and I feel I can trust him, as what he wants from me seems very reasonable. He speaks to you face to face and I try to listen to him a lot<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="yerry-mina.html">Yerry Mina</a>]</b> He deserves everything that is happening to him and he has the ability to play at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because he has a lot of quality. He knows how to play the ball and he takes advantage of his height and has scored many goals. He isn’t under pressure, it might be a little difficult at first, because it is his first experience <b>[in Europe]</b> but I know him and I know he will do very well</p>

  <p><b>[Sanchez backs Osorio to achieve important things ‘no matter where he is’]</b> I know him really well, and he’s a manager who really puts himself into his work. He’s shown that with the Mexican national team and the other teams he’s been with. I think he works hard and if they let him work - give him the chance and the space to work in his way - he’s going to achieve important things no matter where he is<br /><br />He gave me a lot in my career and continues to give me a lot. I’m still in touch with him. We’ve got good communication<br /><br />We’ve met up two times to chat about soccer, to talk about what can happen or what has happened. There’s the friendship, that link that there is between manager and … well, I consider myself another pupil of his. I’m always going to be thrilled and hoping that he’s continuing to do well, as he does toward me<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old declined to say outright that he’d like to play for Osorio as the Colombia]</b> The 22-year-old declined to say outright that he’d like to play for Osorio as the Colombias</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Sanchez looks to <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> for inspiration ahead of Champions League final]</b> Watching DVDs, it was unbelievable the way (Ramos) defends. He has that character you need to play that position. Sometimes now, everyone is too focused on playing football. But sometimes the striker doesn’t care. You see (Liverpool’s Roberto) <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. This guy. Crash. Block. (Harry) <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> as well. If he has to put his leg in, he will<br /><br />Harry’s injury, against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, was the same. His ankle. He tried to block. And boom. The strikers are more worried to recover the ball and you have to be ready to fight against them<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> back in training and expected to be fit to face <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, as revealed by <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, Sanchez knows he will have his work cut out to keep the Brazilian, Salah and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> quiet]</b> A final is about winning. sYou can’t wait for the opponent to be better than you, or let them start to play their football.<br /><br />We are going to start aggressively. A final is about this. Everyone wants to win the trophy. If you have to crash, you have to crash. You don’t care. You have to tackle. Football is not composed of just taking the ball, or clear the ball, properly. <br /><br />Without touching the opponent? No. If you clear the ball and the opponent is in there - I feel sorry for the opponent!</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez has claimed that everyone at the club is pulling in the same direction under manager Jose Mourinho]</b> It’s special. Everyone wants to learn from him and improve, even the more experienced players like <a href="hugo-lloris.html">Hugo Lloris</a>, who is a World Cup winner. We know the gaffer is a very good person, always there asking about your family and everything. We, as a team, are very, very excited to keep improving under him.<br /><br />I think everyone knows as a team we expect to do better. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is always hard but we need to improve, that’s why we put so much work in every day. We’ll see what’s going to happen but looking back we can’t play like we were doing before. We have to do better if we are going to finish in the position that we want</p>
