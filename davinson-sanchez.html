  <p><b>[When Davinson Sanchez arrived at Ajax last year, he saw it as the ideal springboard for greater heights in Europe]</b> I can learn a lot and achieve my personal goals. Ajax is the best club for me to grow as a player.<br /><br />I am a spirited defender who likes to have the ball at his feet. That’s one of my strengths<br /><br />On the streets, fans like getting a picture with me and I see positive reactions. Of course, I find that beautiful, and from the first day the club has helped everyone feel at home. My girlfriend has come along, and my mother and two brothers have also been over. They see that I’m alright here and that I know how to find my way. In South America, Ajax is known as the pathway to a rewarding career in Europe. I just got here, I want to be of great value to the club before I take the next step</p>

Everyone wants to be part of a team like that, they’re one of the world’s elite.<br /><br />I want to be clear that right now I am completely focused on Ajax</p>

I had just won the Libertadores and had to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s second team.<br /><br />Although I was sure that I would finish up in the first team, because I have a lot of confidence in me and my ability to achieve important things, I played 50 games at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <b>[that was]</b> what I needed<br /><br /><b>[Sanchez also claims to have spurned the opportunity to head for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> after speaking with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> head coach <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> The first person I spoke with was <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and I had the chance to go to Italy, but Mauricio convinced me.

I am playing every three to four days. I am being important in the team. As big as Madrid is, no matter how big a team are, that has won what they have won, if the conditions are not favourable for me, unfortunately I cannot accept.</p>

  <p><b>[Sanchez backs Osorio to achieve important things ‘no matter where he is’]</b> I know him really well, and he’s a manager who really puts himself into his work. He’s shown that with the Mexican national team and the other teams he’s been with. I think he works hard and if they let him work - give him the chance and the space to work in his way - he’s going to achieve important things no matter where he is<br /><br />He gave me a lot in my career and continues to give me a lot. I’m still in touch with him. We’ve got good communication<br /><br />We’ve met up two times to chat about soccer, to talk about what can happen or what has happened. There’s the friendship, that link that there is between manager and … well, I consider myself another pupil of his. I’m always going to be thrilled and hoping that he’s continuing to do well, as he does toward me<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old declined to say outright that he’d like to play for Osorio as the Colombia]</b> The 22-year-old declined to say outright that he’d like to play for Osorio as the Colombias</p>

  <p><b>[Davinson Sanchez hopes World Cup experiences can help lift Spurs in Premier League challenge]</b> Last season was good. I love a big challenge. Teams raise their game against us because we are a team with a lot of quality and we need to be ready.<br /><br />For me, it was a good World Cup. The most important thing was how we picked up from the first game - a red card, a penalty. It gives us all a lot of belief. I want to get better, to do more. It’s the same for the team and that’s about belief. The most important thing is you believe in your quality<br /><br />I feel good. I’m here with my team-mates and it’s good. The most important thing is to come back feeling good and to be ready for the start of the season. That’s important for us, to come back in good condition. I’m ready</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Sanchez looks to <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> for inspiration ahead of Champions League final]</b> Watching DVDs, it was unbelievable the way (Ramos) defends. He has that character you need to play that position. Sometimes now, everyone is too focused on playing football. But sometimes the striker doesn’t care. You see (Liverpool’s Roberto) <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. This guy. Crash. Block. (Harry) <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> as well.

A final is about this. Everyone wants to win the trophy. If you have to crash, you have to crash. You don’t care. You have to tackle. Football is not composed of just taking the ball, or clear the ball, properly.<br /><br />Without touching the opponent? No. If you clear the ball and the opponent is in there - I feel sorry for the opponent!</p>
