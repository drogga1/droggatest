  <p><b>[Frankfurt’s forward trio more potent than Liverpool trident]</b> I have no interest in being the centre of attention. I do not care if there is a star and who that is. I do not want to be a star. I like my peace away from the place. And when I’m in the field, I want to score goals. Everyone knows that the most important thing is to work well as a team. We have all developed a winning mentality together.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Sebastien Haller?]</b> I was actually a striker, but when it came to penalties in tournaments, I usually went in the goal. Even then I was one of the biggest players in the team and had very good reflexes. We won some tournaments thanks to my actions. But I was always happier when I was allowed to play outfield. Luckily, I scored enough goals. Otherwise I might have played as a goalkeeper more often.<br /><br />Thierry Henry was one of my greatest role models in my childhood. As a half-Ivorian I also liked Didier Drogba, later Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But I want to write my own story and not copy anyone<br /><br />I would never switch to the Premier League just to play there. It has to make sense to me. And it has to be the right time for me. At the moment, I’m in Frankfurt, and I am very happy here. The Europa League contributes to this. It has already given me great moments and memories.<br /><br />Of course, there is always work to do. For example, being more efficient with scoring opportunities. I know that’s not the only thing I need to improve. Everything I can do better, I have to improve. Whether it’s my passes, speed, shots or ball control and my body. I want to become an even more complete player</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> have completed the club-record signing of <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> striker Sebastien Haller for a fee reported to be worth an initial £40 million plus add-ons]</b> It means a lot <b>[to be the record signing]</b>. It proves that the club <b>[has]</b> really wanted me for a long time. I felt this desire to sign me and I’m really happy to sign, also. it is an ambitious club, a nice club, a nice city and nice fans too. For me I can guarantee that I will give 100 per cent for the club because the club has given me this confidence and I will try to give it back every day in every game. I will always give 100 per cent and respect the club. I think this is a normal thing and that I can guarantee. I know it’s a big transfer and there is a lot of expectation around me, and I just want to make people proud of this transfer and I will give everything I have</p>

I go there for a lot of money, now first game City! Why? There are better games to build your confidence! Hopefully I will touch the ball! We will see<br /><br /><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s side have netted 17 times in their last four visits to London Stadium]</b> What can I say? Everyone needs to be prepared. They are the Champions from the League, the Cup, from even the Cup that I don’t know the name of. So yes, it will be difficult. We will need to make a crazy game. It is probably best for the team to get a game like that because we will need to be focused 100 per cent</b></p>
