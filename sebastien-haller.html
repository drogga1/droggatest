  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the club-record signing of Eintracht Frankfurt striker Sebastien Haller for a fee reported to be worth an initial £40 million plus add-ons]</b> It means a lot <b>[to be the record signing]</b>. It proves that the club <b>[has]</b> really wanted me for a long time. I felt this desire to sign me and I’m really happy to sign, also. it is an ambitious club, a nice club, a nice city and nice fans too. For me I can guarantee that I will give 100 per cent for the club because the club has given me this confidence and I will try to give it back every day in every game. I will always give 100 per cent and respect the club. I think this is a normal thing and that I can guarantee. I know it’s a big transfer and there is a lot of expectation around me, and I just want to make people proud of this transfer and I will give everything I have</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastien Haller says Facing Man City a sh<em>t way to start with West Ham]&lt;/b&gt; What a sh</em>t game to start with! I go there for a lot of money, now first game City! Why? There are better games to build your confidence! Hopefully I will touch the ball! We will see<br /><br /><b>[Guardiola’s side have netted 17 times in their last four visits to London Stadium]</b> What can I say? Everyone needs to be prepared. They are the Champions from the League, the Cup, from even the Cup that I don’t know the name of. So yes, it will be difficult. We will need to make a crazy game. It is probably best for the team to get a game like that because we will need to be focused 100 per cent</b></p>
