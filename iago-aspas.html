  <p><b>[Liverpool flop to Spain sensation - could Iago Aspas swap Celta for top European club?]</b> It was a difficult year but scoring here makes up for it. Now I’m dreaming of going to Russia <b>[for the World Cup with Spain]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Iago Aspas has conceded that he was no match for spectacular Luis Suarez during a forgettable spell at Liverpool]</b> Despite what people may think, it was a very enriching experience for me. In England and then in Seville I grew as a professional and a person. My relationship with <b>[Brendan]</b> Rodgers was normal between a coach and his player. I did not play much that year, but you must remember that I met Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge at the highest level. Suarez is a spectacular striker. I would not have stayed because I wanted to play as many minutes as possible and there I did not have them, not when Suarez was playing like that. Language? I learned something, not much, but football is a universal language.<br /><br />It is always difficult to leave your home. It’s not just the club that you love, I also have my family here, my friends, but it was a very good opportunity for me. I wanted to have the experience of playing in another league, especially in the Premier League. To be able to do it in Liverpool, a historic club in Europe, was something incredible</p>

Hopefully, for the sake of Celta and because of the happiness it would bring Liverpool fans, we can knock out United and they can have a new image to replace it</p>

  <p><b>[Iago Aspas is being mooted as a potential successor to <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> if <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> part with their star striker]</b> It’s flattering to be linked with other teams but I’m focussing on getting some minutes and going to the World Cup. <b>[Aspas added on the €40m price tag which has been placed around his shoulders]</b> I don’t know. It seems like a lot of money to me. I’ve always said that I feel at home at Celta and I signed a new deal last year.

  <p><b>[Aspas happy to have seen Real &amp; <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> interest shunned]</b> I personally did not call another team. It is true that several got in touch with my brother and my agent. I have always been honest, anyone interested had to come to an agreement with Celta first and then we would see if it interested me later. There were important teams, interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Atletico came out in the press and I imagine it was true. The club did not say anything to me. I suppose there were talks and nothing went any further<br /><br />I have always seen myself at Celta for as many years as possible. That is why I signed a contract extension. I hope to speak with the club in the future and to continue for as many years as possible</p>

After that I cannot do anything<br /><br /><b>[Real sacked <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a> after a terrible start to the season]</b> They have good players. It’s true that sometimes they did not play well, they changed their game model from last year, and they have not had time. But so many defeats are hard, and more so in Madrid. They also had the loss of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. He gave them 40 or 50 goals, every year. Before you had a bad game and he solved it. It is impossible not to notice it.</p>
