  <p><b>[Aspas told of that now infamous outing against the Blues - which would prove to be his last for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> - and why it still follows him around like a bad smell]</b> I suppose it’s because it was my last game and we lost. It was a great season for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - one of their best - although I would have liked to have played a bigger part and that corner is the final memory, so it’s their lasting image of me. But in football you can’t forever live in the past. Things keep moving, every day gives you another chance<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> caught me more off guard, younger, it was the first time I left home</p>

  <p><b>[Iago Aspas is being mooted as a potential successor to <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> if <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> part with their star striker]</b> It’s flattering to be linked with other teams but I’m focussing on getting some minutes and going to the World Cup. <b>[Aspas added on the €40m price tag which has been placed around his shoulders]</b> I don’t know. It seems like a lot of money to me. I’ve always said that I feel at home at Celta and I signed a new deal last year. That said, you never know what will happen in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s Reds will have his backing in Kiev, with Aspas still holding fond memories of his time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> despite enduring a testing time on Merseyside]</b> I had a really good season at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I didn’t play much but we were close to winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. On the other hand, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are a Spanish team. I don’t know who I’ll root for, maybe <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because of my past there, even though I’ve got friends at Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Aspas happy to have seen Real &amp; <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> interest shunned]</b> I personally did not call another team. It is true that several got in touch with my brother and my agent. I have always been honest, anyone interested had to come to an agreement with Celta first and then we would see if it interested me later. There were important teams, interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Atletico came out in the press and I imagine it was true. The club did not say anything to me. I suppose there were talks and nothing went any further<br /><br />I have always seen myself at Celta for as many years as possible. That is why I signed a contract extension. I hope to speak with the club in the future and to continue for as many years as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Iago Aspas says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> must first contact Celta Vigo if they wish to sign him]</b> Iago Aspas is very quiet in Celta, I have many years left on my contract, and if they want me first they have to agree with the club. After that I cannot do anything<br /><br /><b>[Real sacked <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a> after a terrible start to the season]</b> They have good players. It’s true that sometimes they did not play well, they changed their game model from last year, and they have not had time. But so many defeats are hard, and more so in Madrid. They also had the loss of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. He gave them 40 or 50 goals, every year. Before you had a bad game and he solved it. It is impossible not to notice it.</p>

Neither. They’re not <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> players. I like the midfield, which is now at its best. They have <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a>, who’s an international but hasn’t had continuity and, for example, I like <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> more than <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Kante<br /><br />I’m very comfortable and at home. Right now, I can’t see myself wearing a shirt that’s not Celta. I’ve not thought about whether or not I would play in the Segunda because I don’t think we’re going down. I would discuss it with the club, but I’m not thinking about it</p>
