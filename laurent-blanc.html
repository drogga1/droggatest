  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="cafu.html">Cafu</a>]</b> He is not only a defender, he is an all-round footballer, and he can do everything. I played against him in Italy when he was with Roma, and he never stopped running up and down the right side of the field. He has brilliant energy and stamina, and oh, what skill too. And, of course, he has leadership skills: don’t forget he captained Brazil to the World Cup in 2002</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Blanc insists Paris Saint-Germain will take the utmost caution to ensure Marco Verratti’s groin injury does not dash his European Championship dreams]</b> As you know Marco Verratti is suffering from a groin strain. He works very hard to recover and he’s made a lot of progress, but he still feels discomfort so he is not at 100 per cent. He is not capable of starting a game. That’s what we are aiming at. So, we take time. He still has some games to play and then there is the Euro, so we don’t want to take a risk with Marco. He is full of future promise. Unfortunately with his groin strain, he can’t start a game, which would be the best for him and for us.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the prospect of the 23-year-old having to go under the knife]</b> An operation? You do everything to avoid it</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain head coach Laurent Blanc voiced his frustration at social media leaks that forced the club to reveal news of Marco Verratti’s groin surgery sooner than they had intended]</b> You know, you always want to avoid a surgery. About the communication issue, yes we planned to tell it a bit later, but now with social media, you can’t keep any information. That’s what I was telling to our two Italian friends <b>[journalists]</b>, we decided to tell it later, because we respect the Italian Federation and we wanted to talk with them about the decision we took for Marco.<br /><br />But when the information leaks, it goes crazy, and two hours later <b>[it is]</b> on social media, you know communication now is very complicated. You know it very well, it’s very hard to keep something secret. It wasn’t even a secret, we wanted to be straight with the Italian Federation<br /><br />I wish the season was even longer. We will do 60 games, I wish we could make 63 one day</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has stressed he will not take any risks with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the remainder of the season with an eye on Euro 2016]</b> Ibrahimovic has a minor problem with his calf, but it was enough for him to prefer to be taken off. Fatigue is slowly starting to play a role, but he will do everything to play in our last league game against Nantes and in the Coupe de France final against Marseille. There are some important things coming up for him like Euro 2016, though, so we will not take any risks.</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>]</b> When I see his stats and the records he is breaking - records were just a matter of time. When people ask me if I’m surprised he has scored so many goals, no I’m not. He is a player whos has always scored goals - in Spain, in Italy. His statistics are unbelievable. He is an incredible competitor. He wants to win everything, he wants to score more goals. <b>[. . .]</b> When I hear people questioning his abilities it means they don’t know a thing about football. He can have difficult patches of form but when you see what he has done, and I don’t think it’s over, I think it’s impressive</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Blanc has explained why he is unlikely to go back into international football while being linked to the vacant USA national team coaching position]</b> I was asked, but for a national team, it’s a no. It’s especially difficult if you’re not from that country. A national team must make the national fibres shake. So, I declined it.<br /><br />The Bundesliga is a great league but I don’t speak the language. It’s difficult to manage players when you can’t communicate. I know I’m fussy, only a big club would interest me. If not, I’ll face facts and think of something else.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is a technically superior player to Arsenal and France legend Patrick Vieira]</b> I think he’s a new player, let’s not forget he’s young, so I think he still has room to improve. In my generation we have very physically impressive players, like Patrick Vieira, for example. Technically speaking Patrick is really good, but he is not as good as Pogba, especially in terms of attacking. If he can optimise his physical potential and his technique, he will be able to score many goals. He is well ahead of the other players in terms of physical levels, it will make a difference at some point in the game.<br /><br />In the next few years, I think if Pogba does not suffer from injury problems, he will be one of the key players for France and also his club, lucky enough to have Pogba</p>

  <p><b>[Former France boss Laurent Blanc has hailed Kylian Mbappe and Eden Hazard as phenomenons]</b> My opinion’s not changed on him for 10 months: he’s a phenomenon. That’s not to say he’ll make us win all the time. He’s young. He’s still going to misfire sometimes - as little as possible, I hope for him and the France team. We must be patient with young players. But he’s got more than talent. He’s a guy who can scare defenders. The whole team benefits from the fear that the opposition have for him. That’s good for the collective. At 19, you can’t have everything. It’s not possible. I hope that he won’t be perturbed. I hope we’ll see the fullness of his talents for a long time.<br /><br /><b>[Blanc does not believe France will have it easy against Belgium]</b> They’ve got a phenomenon of their own with Eden Hazard. They’ve a very effective system, especially on the counterattack. Brazil were victims of that. They’ve players who stick to the game plan. It’ll be complicated because they’ve made a very good impression. Their attacking trio is excellent<br /><br /><b>[On Thierry Henry]</b> I find it a little bizarre. It surprised me, but it’s like that. For Thierry, having seen the quality of Belgium’s attackers, he must be very happy because he’s got a lot to work with<br /><br /><b>[Blanc sees France as a team capable of emulating the feat of his generation in 1998]</b> Yes. I said it! Everyone I meet on the street says that we’re going to win the World Cup. It was only two or three months ago no one believed it was possible. France have shown they’re capable, but the hardest part starts now</p>

But I was in Paris so it was very difficult for me to leave. We kept in touch but they went with Van Gaal in the end<br /><br />Managing in England is a big ambition. I have big experience at Paris. It’s difficult for me to go to another club in France. I want a different challenge in England, Spain or Italy. I played in those countries, I know them, so I keep going to games and I see what calls come in</p>
