  <p><b>[Laurent Blanc following <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>’s 2-0 win at Bordeaux on Friday night]</b> We weren’t prepared for it at all but, ironically, this was our best performance of the season. Players returned <b>[from international duty]</b> yesterday at 18:15 - nothing was prepared and you see the result? The coach is useless!</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> I only played with him for two seasons at the end of my career, and he had some injuries, but I saw more than enough to appreciate his brilliance. He is one of the best players I have ever seen. Not only that, but he could motivate players too. He was the boss too. He is also a good man</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="cafu.html">Cafu</a>]</b> He is not only a defender, he is an all-round footballer, and he can do everything. I played against him in Italy when he was with Roma, and he never stopped running up and down the right side of the field. He has brilliant energy and stamina, and oh, what skill too. And, of course, he has leadership skills: don’t forget he captained Brazil to the World Cup in 2002</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a>]</b> He is a monster! <b>[. . .]</b> he is an absolute monster! He can play in defence or midfield, but I think he is better as a centre-back. In fact, I’m sure of that. He has so much quality. Forwards simply couldn’t get past him because of his size, but he was smart and quick too</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>]</b> When I see his stats and the records he is breaking - records were just a matter of time. When people ask me if I’m surprised he has scored so many goals, no I’m not. He is a player whos has always scored goals - in Spain, in Italy. His statistics are unbelievable. He is an incredible competitor. He wants to win everything, he wants to score more goals. <b>[. . .]</b> When I hear people questioning his abilities it means they don’t know a thing about football. He can have difficult patches of form but when you see what he has done, and I don’t think it’s over, I think it’s impressive</p>
