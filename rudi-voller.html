  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen’s sporting director Rudi Voller on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> The gap with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is too big to ever close again. It is impossible to organise your scouting department in a way that’s good enough to make <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> even worry. They are on a completely different level. Leverkusen tried to keep up with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in the 2000s, but we eventually reached our natural limits. We had to let go</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller has told Paris Saint-Germain to expect a fight if they wish to buy Wendell]</b> We don’t want to sell Wendell. And there have been no official offers. We’re relaxed. There will be rumours regarding our players over the next few weeks, over and over again. But I’d worry if that wasn’t the case. Playing in three competitions next season, we need our best players here.</p>

Brandt has some requests, and in the next five, six or seven days there will be a decision.<br /><br />By reaching the Champions League, we hope we have a small or big chance (that he will stay).<br /><br /><b>[On midfielder Kai Havertz]</b> There is no discussion with him anyway. He is a wonderful footballer, but he is only 19. One year - at least - at Bayer Leverkusen would do him good, and then we’ll see</p>

If that’s not the case one day. There you can follow all the top European leagues</p>

We’ll see how it looks in summer. He still has a contract until 2022 - these are, of course, the classic facts. There was already interest in the summer, but we told him that it would be good for him to stay with us for another year. And that was the right decision</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen have signed Charles Aranguiz to a new contract which will keep the Chile international at the club until 2023]</b> We’ve had a lot of good discussions with Charles over recent weeks and his desire to stay absolutely coincides with what we want. Charles is a really important player for our team. The fact we have again been able to agree a long-term contract underlines the full conviction of everybody involved and mutual confidence</p>

It doesn’t change the fact that he’s already a world-class player anyway, that’s what he was before. Now the attention is even more on him. He will switch to an absolute world-class club at some point</p>

Of course, you can’t force anyone. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> knows what he owes to his colleagues, the fans and the club</p>
