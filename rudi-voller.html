  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen’s sporting director Rudi Voller on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> The gap with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is too big to ever close again. It is impossible to organise your scouting department in a way that’s good enough to make <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> even worry. They are on a completely different level. Leverkusen tried to keep up with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in the 2000s, but we eventually reached our natural limits. We had to let go</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen’s Julian Brandt is one of the wide candidates under consideration by Liverpool should they strengthen their forward options in January]</b> We know what Julian’s contract looks like and we know he is feeling very well here. It would not be the first time a player reaches a stage where he wants to leave. I hope it will not happen with Julian, but we will just move on if it happens.</p>

  <p><b>[Hakan Calhanoglu has been banned from football for four months after being found to have breached his contract with Trabzonspor FC in 2011]</b> Of course, we regret this decision which is completely incomprehensible for us. It’s a heavy blow for Hakan but also for us. We are also being heavily punished, although Bayer Leverkusen had nothing to do with the events in 2011. We are now missing a very important player in a crucial phase of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen have confirmed the signing of highly-rated Greece Under-21 international defender Panagiotis Retsos from Olympiakos]</b> Retsos had offers from some top clubs playing internationally this year, so it is all the more pleasing for us that he has decided to move to Bayer - especially since he was so elemental to Olympiakos qualifying for the Champions League. He’s a young player with special talents and fits perfectly into our requirements. He is an investment in the future of the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is the only player in the world game who should be worth a transfer fee of more than €100 million]</b> For me, there is only one player worth more than €100m, and of course that is Lionel Messi. But I’ve grown used to being amazed.<br /><br /><b>[On Leon Bailey]</b> Bayern Munich are the only club that can and will say no. If a player attracts big teams, we and the other Bundesliga clubs have to give in, but there are pain thresholds</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Leon Bailey?]</b> We have proven many times that we can say ‘no’. There are limits you can reach, but that’s a theme of our policy, independent of Leon Bailey. If there is a need for discussion, we all sit down and decide what is best, while also keeping other alternatives open</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen have indicated that they can keep hold of striking sensation Leon Bailey for as long as possible]</b> Leon loves this team and he needs his team-mates. He gives it back and that makes him all the more valuable to us. We would be doing bad work if other clubs.<br /><br />We’re happy with his development. We had to sign him in the winter last year because of the threat of losing him to a competitor. We had a difficult situation back then, but we were convinced by him and were not afraid of the risk</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller has told Paris Saint-Germain to expect a fight if they wish to buy Wendell]</b> We don’t want to sell Wendell. And there have been no official offers. We’re relaxed. There will be rumours regarding our players over the next few weeks, over and over again. But I’d worry if that wasn’t the case. Playing in three competitions next season, we need our best players here.</p>

He is a wonderful footballer, but he is only 19. One year - at least - at Bayer Leverkusen would do him good, and then we’ll see</p>

We’ll see how it looks in summer. He still has a contract until 2022 - these are, of course, the classic facts. There was already interest in the summer, but we told him that it would be good for him to stay with us for another year. And that was the right decision</p>

Charles is a really important player for our team. The fact we have again been able to agree a long-term contract underlines the full conviction of everybody involved and mutual confidence</p>

It doesn’t change the fact that he’s already a world-class player anyway, that’s what he was before. Now the attention is even more on him. He will switch to an absolute world-class club at some point</p>

Of course, you can’t force anyone. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> knows what he owes to his colleagues, the fans and the club</p>
