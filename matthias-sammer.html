  <p><b>[Matthias Sammer on <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>]</b> <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> is on par with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. You can’t put a price on Arjen - not as a player and not as a person either. He has the advantage of having a stable life. The consistency with which he performs at the highest level in big games, and his training intensity, are extraordinary</p>

  <p><b>[Sammer feels that the most important thing is that they meet their six-week deadline]</b> You need someone that connects players, staff, coaches and the board. This makes the club stronger. Bayern dominated Real Madrid <b>[in the Champions League quarter-finals]</b> for long periods, but suddenly lost their unity and with that their stability, too. This happened in exactly the same fashion in the second half against Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-final. It is not a coincidence this happened: in certain phases, the team didn’t look stable or united.<br /><br />In their daily routine, it can be helpful for players and a coach to have someone there to give little tips. At the top level, many things must be spotted early and nipped in the bud. For example, when a coach is angry with a player and isn’t talking to him at that moment. You sometimes lose a few per cent in terms of performance because only 11 players are happy and the other 13 or 14 are not. Sometimes even the kit man has a problem with the physio or the doctor with the coaching staff. That’s everyday life at a football club; there has to be someone who takes care of these problems in the interest of the club and success. To sum up, I believe this position is vital.</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Sammer thinks defender <a href="joshua-kimmich.html">Joshua Kimmich</a> can be a leader for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Germany]</b> I am sure that he will play a big role in German football. In my opinion he will be a leader. He brings characteristics that are very special in the offence as well as in the defence. The way he presents himself and what he says - and he does that with no aggression at all - Joshua has that in his nature. That is just beautiful. The performances, him being humble and simple and his charisma, I really like that</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have made the right decision in bringing Jupp Heynckes back to replace Carlo Ancelotti as head coach]</b> Jupp looked as if he had never been away. He looks good and recovered. He was excellent at the presentation. I’m convinced that this will be a very good story. It’s absolutely 100% the right decision. Jupp is much too dynamic and far too young not to be able to tackle this major task and - of course with limited time - once again and above all to solve it. I have great respect for his decision. He has won the Champions League twice <b>[in 1998 with Real Madrid and 2013 with the Bayern]</b>. He won the treble with Bayern in a big era. These are abilities that are invaluable. Bayern have now taken advantage of this. That’s why there is no risk for me at all - for both sides!.</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Sammer has admitted that Bayern Munich made a mistake in selling Toni Kroos to Real Madrid]</b> Sometimes there are situations that you have to analyse honestly in retrospect. Who can say they have done everything right in life? Maybe Bayern Munich would have won the Champions League more often with Toni or at least reached the final. I can say today that, in my role, it was a mistake to let Toni go. I was sitting on Toni’s couch trying to change his mind. I’ve been able to work with him for a long time and have known him since he was 16 or 17. His departure didn’t shake Bayern, but when you talk about whether it was good or bad to let Toni go, you have to say it was bad, very bad. But for Toni’s personal development and value, the change was definitely the right one.</p>

  <p><b>[On Arjen Robben]</b> Arjen is a perfect example of how an older player can still learn and develop, and refuse to be satisfied with what he’s already achieved. He’s world class. I can only encourage every young player to watch and learn from him.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern’s Matthias Sammer believes that Gotze deserves more credit for his Bayern spell]</b> Mario has received too little love and recognition at Bayern. Young, sensitive people need rhythm in their lives. That was taken from him. Mario and I had a close relationship, but I was not the coach. Mario with his deep way of thinking must feel love and trust, he must be untouchable. At the same time Pep Guardiola: Full of ambition. That’s why he sometimes had too little calmness and independence in his decisions. It was logical for me to comfort Mario. The club was not able to do that. You have to be able to read people and meet their characteristics and abilities. Unfortunately, not many people recognize that.</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho and Borussia Dortmund’s title-chasing novices have been slammed as 	immature]</b> This is Borussia Dortmund, where people think: ‘We are already the German champion’. But they are immature. You could see it for some time now. Do all the players really know what they are up against? <b>[Achraf]</b> Hakimi does not, Sancho does not, <b>[Dan-Axel]</b> Zagadou does not. They do not know. Those three, plus ten kilometres less running overall and you have a match where you play with four players less.<br /><br />That’s what makes champions. But you can’t be a champion, when you’re 19 or 20 years old. Sancho is 18… how is that supposed to work? Of course there are factors like tactics, positioning, spaces, but that match is decided in your head. More in the head than with your legs. Look at the team and the players I just mentioned and their potential. It is not always about reaching your full potential, but with 60 or 70 per cent it does not work</p>
