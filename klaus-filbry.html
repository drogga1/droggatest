  <p><b>[Werder Bremen chairman Klaus Filbry says <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> took the easy way]</b> I would have hoped for some more perseverance from Serge. Maybe he opted for the easiest way. I think it’s a pity, but I wish him all the best. I was hoping that he could imagine a longer stay at Bremen - and the talks we had also suggested that was an option. But then he did not really get going again after his injury. Maybe that made him change his mind. The decision made by the coach <b>[to drop Gnabry]</b> were absolutely understandable. We were successful and won<br /><br /><b>[Filbry stated the nature of <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a>’s exit would make it unlikely there would be additional funds to spend in the transfer market]</b> We got him a year ago for a certain sum; now we’re selling him again for a certain sum. With the salary he’s got in the meantime, it’s almost a zero-sum game for us, thus opening up no new scope for action</p>
