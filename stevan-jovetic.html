  <p><b>[Stevan Jovetic has hit out at reports claiming he is embroiled in a dispute with Inter and the club’s head coach Roberto Mancini over an injury problem]</b> I keep reading crazy things about me that, frankly, I don’t understand. I want to clearly specify that there’s no problem with Inter and Mr. Mancini. I wasn’t on some secret trip into Germany, it was a visit which was controlled and authorised by my club. Now I’m obliged, like everyone here, to be at Montenegro’s disposal. I’m here, I’m training and we’ll monitor my fitness day by day.</p>

  <p><b>[Stevan Jovetic has no intention of trying to replace Kylian Mbappe]</b> Honestly, I don’t <b>[feel under pressure]</b>. I just want to enjoy the games, have fun. I did not come here to replace anyone. I just want to give my best and help my team. I do not want to be compared to someone else. I just want to be me, enjoy the game, be happy and score goals. That’s my only goal.<br /><br />I like playing as a striker but not alone, I prefer to play in a system with two strikers. Sometimes just a little behind or on the same line, this is my favorite position. We have great players and they are all really good so we’ll see. It’s up to the coach to make the choice but I think I can play with everybody. Falcao? Yes. Radamel is a top player, he scores many goals and is in great shape. I’ll be glad to play with him<br /><br /><b>[With so many exciting options at their disposal, Jovetic is convinced that the current title holders can hold their own against PSG, Mbappe and €222m man Neymar]</b> We will see, but I think we can compete with them</p>
