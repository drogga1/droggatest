  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> midfielder Joshua Kimmich says about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> trust in him]</b> I felt like Pep and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> had seen something in me, and I wanted to show them that they weren’t wrong. It’s cliche to say, but this past year has been like a dream has come true. I’m only 21 years old, and every day, I get to walk onto the pitch with some of the greatest footballers in the world. World Cup winners, European championship winners and Champions League winners are now my team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Joshua Kimmich has claimed that Chelsea forward Alvaro Morata rates as the toughest player he has ever had to face]</b> It was very tough to play against him because he has a very strong body, he is very fast and has a good technique. So it wasn’t easy to play against him.<br /><br /><b>[On outstanding player of his generation]</b> I think there are a lot of good players. Neymar is not that old but he’s not my age. Paul Pogba is two years older than me and Paulo Dybala I think is one year older than me. For me, Kingsley Coman is a greater player, but he’s one year younger than me. I think we have a good generation with a lot of very good players</p>

You have to know where your team-mates are, so he wants you to screen the whole field. Pep would talk to you immediately if he recognised something. He also has this amazing view of football. For every opponent he had the perfect master plan</p>

I can not list all the chances, but there were six to seven good ones.<br /><br /><b>[Bayern’s players are confident that they can still turn the tie around at the Bernabeu]</b> There are two games, so we are not out yet, even if the starting situation is not good but very bad.

Yes, I was <b>[surprised]</b>. I know the national team only with these three players. Over the past 10 years, they have shaped the team and made us world champions. They are also my team-mates. From a player’s point of view, the way was not okay, so I understand that the guys are disappointed.<br /><br />Especially when you consider that they are only 29 and 30 years old. Thomas has made 100 games for Germany, for example. Then you have earned another departure. Football is often talked about old and young - I think that none of the boys are too old to play in the national team<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he thought the trio stepped up to prove a point to Low]</b> You do not shake things off that easily. I am a national player myself and I know how special it is to play for Germany. I do not think you can get that out of your head after two days, but today they showed what they got.

We won games confidently at the beginning of the season. But then we were often too careless. There were many individual mistakes, for which he cannot do anything about. We have the highest quality squad, so we are expected to march through the league. As a coach and a player, we are measured at the highest level.</p>

He’s a great finisher too.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Werner could slot in effectively at the Allianz Arena]</b> Of course it’s a different game for us. But, in principle, a striker of Timo’s quality, who has scored about 10 to 15 goals, for two or three years consecutively can help many teams<br /><br />I did expect that they would rise to the Bundesliga and have an impact there although the fact that they became a top club so quickly was probably a surprise for everyone. The quality was certainly there though<br /><br />We know how RB play and they know how we play. Their strength is in their defending. They conceded the fewest goals in the Bundesliga. But we know that when we are at our best we can win. I assume we will have more possession and then it depends how much we let RB come into the game. We did it well in the last meeting and we need to do it again at the weekend. Then we can win</p>
