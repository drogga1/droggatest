  <p><b>[Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich says about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> trust in him]</b> I felt like Pep and Bayern had seen something in me, and I wanted to show them that they weren’t wrong. It’s cliche to say, but this past year has been like a dream has come true. I’m only 21 years old, and every day, I get to walk onto the pitch with some of the greatest footballers in the world. World Cup winners, European championship winners and Champions League winners are now my team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[Joshua Kimmich talks about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s influence on his career]</b> There are many things – but Pep showed me completely new spaces in the field. I improved a lot. He cares about your first touch a lot and that you know what to do even before you get the ball. You have to know where your team-mates are, so he wants you to screen the whole field. Pep would talk to you immediately if he recognised something. He also has this amazing view of football. For every opponent he had the perfect master plan</p>

If you really want to tear it up in the Champions League, then maybe we still need some more <b>[new signings]</b>.</p>

Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has been named Footballer of the Year in Germany for the second time in his career. The Association of German Sports Journalists, in conjunction with football magazine Kicker, gave Reus 150 of the 540 votes cast to place him ahead of Bayer Leverkusen prodigy Kai Havertz and Bayern Munich full-back Joshua Kimmich.</p>

If Leroy wanted to, he would probably already be here, so I do not know what the state of affairs is<br /><br />You read something from time to time, then you read something else. I have no idea.

We are now on the third matchday, we have to look after ourselves and still have work to do. We’ve already left some points behind. There are still enough matchdays ahead of us. If we get our points, then we’ll be champions again. But we still have to work hard for that. Leipzig got off to a perfect start with three victories. We’re behind, so of course we don’t want to be in that position that long. We always prefer to be right at the front. We can make sure of that with the next game. In Leipzig you can set an exclamation mark. It’s definitely a good time to play against Leipzig - they’re in a good mood and we can see where we stand. We came in with three games, now there’s the international break and then it’s all about Leipzig and the Champions League.</p>

I myself know the Bayern only with <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>. Without him the club would not be there, where it is now. It’s the case that when he comes into the game he always plays well. In the last game he has set up another goal. Also in the games before.<br /><br />Against Cologne or Mainz he even assisted two goals and also scored one goal, if I remember right. We all know that he has qualities that are difficult for the opponent to control. I don’t know if he wants to go or not. I can understand that he claims to want to play. I know what it’s like to sit on a bench. With <b>[former head coach]</b> <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> I also sat on the bench several times.

The table for the youth players was full. That wasn’t the case during my first year at Bayern. We might play until the end of the season in all three competitions and we have lots of international players too, so we need more players who are fit. Of course we have a lot of injured players. <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> couldn’t train, <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> and <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Coman</a> will return soon. <a href="javi-martinez.html">Javi Martinez</a> also has a knock and <a href="niklas-sule.html">Niklas Sule</a> and <a href="lucas-hernandez.html">Lucas Hernandez</a> will take time.

  <p><b>[Kimmich thankful for Paderborn ‘lesson’ ahead of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Champions League clash]</b> You can always learn lessons. You can see that mistakes in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> are punished harshly and that we can have problems against every opponent if we don’t play at the limit - even if it is the bottom of the table. We have to make better use of our chances up front, so we can have a quieter evening<br /><br />You can easily shake it off. We remain variable with such changes, which makes it harder for the opponent to adjust to us. I welcome something like that<br /><br /><b>[Kimmich is expecting a tight contest between the two sides, even if <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have struggled as of late]</b> They have a good mix between young and experienced players.

Therefore we started the initiative and hope that we can help many people who need help during this time<br /><br />In the beginning I was very sceptical whether the cyber training would work. But you have to say that it is fun. It’s a good opportunity for us to keep in touch with the players. Everyone is there, you can see each other on your mobile phone or whatever device you are logged in with. You have to compliment the fitness trainers at this point because it works really well. We players sweat a lot, give everything and every player pulls along very well</p>
