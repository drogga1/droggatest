  <p><b>[Mitch Duke has targeted 10 goals in the final six months of his Shimizu S-Pulse contract]</b> It’s probably the most important six months of my career to be honest. I had big expectations for myself last year and unfortunately this injury set me back, and I was hitting good form before my injury with my three starts before … my main aim is this six months is sort of the six months I lost last year. Here’s my chance to sort of repay the club for what they’ve done and hopefully I can repay the favour for them and myself and set myself up with some good offers and possible options in the <b>[Japanese]</b> summer.<br /><br />I’ve just turned 26 so my window’s <b>[to go to Europe]</b> closing very quickly, so hopefully I can do as well as I can, hopefully score double-digits within the six months and see what kind of options I have<br /><br />I think I’m more than ready to really have a breakout year this year. I’m feeling fit and ready and only myself can hold me back really<br /><br />It was such a shame because I did hit form as a striker and then three games later I got injured. But he’s <b>[Kobayashi]</b> looking at me as another striker for this year. We just lost an important striker in Genki <b>[Omae]</b> - our number 10 - he scored 18 goals last year and he’s left for another club. So that’s a big chance for me to fill that spot</p>

  <p><b>[Australian striker Mitch Duke is confident he will get more of an opportunity at Shimizu S-Pulse after making his first start in over 11 months]</b> I surprisingly felt really good. I’ve had a few training matches and stuff. Around a week-and-a-half ago I had about 80 minutes in a training match and I actually felt that I struggled with fitness there but in the game last night - I think it was maybe the adrenalin as well, just playing in the football atmosphere again - I got through it so well and ran hard to the last minute.<br /><br />I actually had three heading opportunities <b>[against Kashiwa]</b> that two of them I probably should have actually scored. So I was getting the opportunities and I’m hoping now with more game time that I’m able to punish <b>[opposition sides]</b> a bit more. Other than the goals, I played really well. I was happy with my touches, with my passing and my control</p>

  <p><b>[Australian striker Mitch Duke has spoken of the relief he felt at ending his one-year scoring drought for Shimizu S-Pulse]</b> I just felt relief. I feel like since I’ve been back fit I’ve been saying to myself that I wanted to get off the mark as soon as possible when I started playing competitive football matches again. I don’t feel like I need to earn a contract here. I have been here for almost two-and-a-half years now. They know what I am capable of and what I bring to the team. Unfortunately I lost pretty much the whole season last year due to my knee injury and since then I’ve literally only played 120 minutes of competitive football and to have a goal already with only that amount of minutes I’m happy and hope I can build on this and put my hand up to play more. It is an important time for me but I’m not worried about the contract situation.<br /><br /><b>[On Jong Tae-se]</b> He has just kept up his great form from last season and is really high on confidence. Nothing can stop him at the moment. But it’s obviously great to have such an influential player in our team and personally it’s obviously great for me to learn from and ask advice. I’ve been very lucky with the time I’ve had with S-Pulse having some great strikers on our books in Peter Utaka and Genki Omae and now Tae-se</p>
