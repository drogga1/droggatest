<blockquote>
  <p>[Mitch Duke has targeted 10 goals in the final six months of his Shimizu S-Pulse contract] It’s probably the most important six months of my career to be honest. I had big expectations for myself last year and unfortunately this injury set me back, and I was hitting good form before my injury with my three starts before … my main aim is this six months is sort of the six months I lost last year. Here’s my chance to sort of repay the club for what they’ve done and hopefully I can repay the favour for them and myself and set myself up with some good offers and possible options in the [Japanese] summer.<br /><br />I’ve just turned 26 so my window’s [to go to Europe] closing very quickly, so hopefully I can do as well as I can, hopefully score double-digits within the six months and see what kind of options I have<br /><br />I think I’m more than ready to really have a breakout year this year. I’m feeling fit and ready and only myself can hold me back really<br /><br />It was such a shame because I did hit form as a striker and then three games later I got injured. But he’s [Kobayashi] looking at me as another striker for this year. We just lost an important striker in Genki [Omae] - our number 10 - he scored 18 goals last year and he’s left for another club. So that’s a big chance for me to fill that spot</p>
