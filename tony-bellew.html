  <p><b>[Tony Bellew talks about <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s mooted transfer]</b> I’d be heartbroken to see him go. He’s a fantastic player, scored tonnes of goals, from inside the box and outside the box. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> is irreplaceable. You are not going to get one man who is going to come in and score the same amount of goals as he did. It’s going to take two or three</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Bellew plans to watch the Champions League final this weekend, even if he would rather not. The former world champion boxer - and big <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fan - tells why he’s got a shuttle booked for Saturday evening]</b> I’ve booked a shuttle to the moon. It leaves at about 9.45pm on Saturday! I know, I know. It would be hell, wouldn’t it?<br /><br /><b>[Bellew makes no secret of his disdain for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a>. but he expects <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side to break his heart on Saturday]</b> I will never ever allow myself to think they will lose. Experience tells me you just don’t do that. When they lost 3-0 in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, my Blue mates were loving it and I was telling them all to be quiet, to say nothing because it will come back and bite us. Did they not learn anything from Istanbul?!<br /><br />It’s about giving back to young kids. It’s been a real eye-opener for me, I can tell you. I spent some time over in Africa recently, in Kenya, and to see the upbringing these children are having is humbling. It gives you a new outlook. I thought I came from a rough area. Well my house was like Buckingham Palace compared to what I saw over there. I visited a boxing gym and they had no gloves, no pads, no bags. And this gym created a world champion, Fatuma Zarika. Imagine what they can do with a bit of help, funding and support?<br /><br /><b>[A mega-fight against Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez, the unified middleweight champion, looms on the horizon should he defeat N’Dam this weekend. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> has been mentioned, tentatively, as a possible venue]</b> I can’t see Canelo coming over here, to be honest. But I would absolutely love it if he did. I’d love to see him fight Callum at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. I’d even go there for that one! Callum is one of the best to ever come out of this city, and did brilliantly to win the World Boxing Super Series. It’s a huge ask against Canelo, who for me is the best counter-puncher in the world. I don’t like the fella, but I admire his ability. Pound-for-pound, there’s possibly only <b>[Vasyl]</b> Lomachenko who is more complete. But I know better than to write Callum Smith off. He’s had to fight for everything all his life, and I know how much it means to him. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> is the dream, but I can see that fight being made for Las Vegas next year. And believe me, there’s a lot of risk in it for Canelo.<br /><br /><b>[As for Bellew, he is enjoying the first stages of retirement having hung up his gloves following his defeat to undisputed cruiserweight king Oleksandr Usyk last November]</b> It’s good, I’m happy. I’m very busy with a few businesses and companies, and I’m doing some media and ambassadorial work. The main thing is I’m spending time with my family, and I’m not getting punched in the face any more. That’s always a bonus!<br /><br /><b>[Bellew’s love of <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, of course, is well known, and the 36-year-old remains a Goodison regular. So what has he made of the Toffees’ progress under <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a>?]</b> Started well, iffy in the middle, finished well. We’ve beaten some big, big teams recently, which is great. Drilling <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> 4-0 is always enjoyable! The boss has done very well in my opinion. This, remember, isn’t Silva’s squad. He’s still dealing with players that were left for him, and I’ll be interested to see the changes he makes in the summer. He’s very thorough and he knows what he wants. I’m a realist, not a fantasist. I know the Champions League is unrealistic for now, but I’d love to see us improve and get into the Europa League, then build again from there. It’s been great to hear the atmosphere at Goodison of late, and we know what a difference that can make. You only need to look over the park at the Devil’s club to see that. I love Goodison when it’s loud and nasty and intimidating. I hope it can stay that way next season<br /><br /><b>[What if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lose on Saturday? What will happen to his shuttle then?]</b> It’ll be the world’s biggest firework. And I’ll be able to show my face in the city over the summer!</p>
