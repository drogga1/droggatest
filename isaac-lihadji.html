  <p><b>[Having impressed new OM coach <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Andre Villas-Boas</a> in pre-season, Lihadji was handed his senior debut on September 24, 2019]</b> I know that I have been eagerly awaited, but you have to be careful not to get ahead of yourself. I will do what is necessary to make people proud. <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a> gives me a lot of advice. To be a key player for OM is my goal</p>
