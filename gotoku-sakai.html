  <p><b>[Stuttgart’s Gotoku Sakai says Germans aggressive on and off the pitch]</b> <b>[Okazaki]</b> tells me, ‘Go get something to drink! Go get something to eat!’ And I must hurry. I’m his apprentice and he is my teacher, but Shinji is much more childish and cheeky than I. It’s not fair!<br /><br /><b>[Okazaki discusses the differences he’ve encountered in the transition to living in Germany]</b> Germans are more emotional than we are, and they are more quicker to let their feelings be known. It does not matter whether they are on the football pitch or at home relaxing - they act aggressively<br /><br /><b>[Sakai, a natural right back, expressed his comfort with being used on the left at Stuttgart]</b> <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a> is a similar player to me and he plays well at left-back for Bayern. I look to him as an example for myself</p>

  <p><b>[Andres <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> has been an inspiration to millions during his iconic career, with the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend now passing on priceless experience to the likes of Gotoku Sakai at Vissel Kobe]</b> Andres is not the type of guy who demands things from other people, he just gets on by himself. In fact, about after two days after I started, I couldn’t react to his passes in training. It was a different dimension for me, like, ‘can a pass be made at this speed?’. Andres was apologetic, but it was clearly my mistake. So I asked the interpreter to tell him that I would run and get it next time, so please continue. During the games, I shout out to him ‘Are you alright? Not too tired?’ or ‘Shall I go for it?’ when we are defending, and when we are attacking. And since the match against Tosu, around that time, I started understanding where Andres would be, or where he would make a pass to, those kind of things, and it became very easy to play with him.<br /><br />While there are many occasions that you have to dribble, because Andres can move the ball with one touch, that creates rhythm for the team and that makes me able to move things with one touch when I am supporting him. He has a playing style that always makes players around him involved. He shows us how to make rhythm. There are so many things I can learn during training. I am really having a great time<br /><br /><b>[Asked what can be taken from those who have graced the very top of the game]</b> Just everything. Especially for the young ones, not only humility, attitude to training and technique, but also why they have such high levels. Of course, there is a reason. For me, there are so many things I want to ask. Like, ‘What were you doing when you were young?’ or ‘Is there anything I can start doing now?’. If I was still 19-20 years old, I would stick with Andres and be questioning him all the time. In fact, when I was in Niigata that’s how I developed, by sticking with my seniors and listening<br /><br /><b>[Sakai, who started out at Albirex Niigata and spent time with Stuttgart and Hamburg before returning to Asia]</b> The players of Kobe are fortunate to have the players like him <b>[Iniesta]</b> and must learn from him. Super first-class players are super first-class in every aspect. In fact, all the super first-class players I’ve ever played with were all the same like that, both in their humility and how they approach football. I would love to learn a lot from them. It doesn’t mean that I want to go and play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> now, but if I can rise a little higher than I am now, I want to listen to everything and learn anything</p>
