  <p><b>[Shane Duffy pleased after home Ireland debut]</b> I was more ready for it now than I was two years ago when I played. I enjoyed it, playing in front of Irish fans for the first time was enjoyable, and I had goosebumps out there. It was a day I dreamed of, and I’ve got it. I’m playing more regularly and consistently. I’ve matured as a centre half. The more games you play, the better you get. I was quite raw two years ago, I still am, but I’m playing every week and I’m enjoying it. I’m delighted to come here, and just trying to impress the manager and the players<br /><br />I try to get in the game. I try to be a leader. It helps with good players in front of me. I’m quiet off the pitch but I try to be vocal on it. I’m just happy we got the clean sheet and the win<br /><br />We just have to try and go out there and do what we can do and impress the manager. I try to go out there and enjoy playing for Ireland. It’s only one game, but it was good. <b>[Ciaran Clark]</b> plays on the left and I play on the right. Listen we’ve got so many good centre-halves here, it’s hard to even get close to the squad so I’m delighted to be here. You never know. Everyone wants to play, but the lads who got us to the Euros, they’ve done all the hard work, so you can’t just expect to come in. I’ll bide my time and if it’s not this one, then it’s the next campaign. I’ve just got to focus on club football, and try to impress. If that does it, then I’ve got to come in and put in a performance<br /><br />After that you just want to go again. I didn’t want it to end to be honest, I was just enjoying it. I wish we played better the second half, but defensively I’m happy. Tuesday you never know, but there’s a lot of centre-halves</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton defender Shane Duffy has praised former Everton team-mate Romelu Lukaku]</b> The goals he has got show what he can do. We were both at Everton at the same time. He’s done brilliantly and is now regarded as one of the top strikers in the world. He’s still young. He has a lot of pressure on him trying to deliver goals for Manchester United - it’s not an easy task.<br /><br /><b>[On Chris Hughton]</b> I can’t speak highly enough of him, for what he has done for me personally, and at this club to bring them from where they were when he first came in to now. Now he is getting the credit he fully deserves. He’s brought my game on to a level I thought I could probably never get to. He has both sides of it - the coaching and managing a squad. He is very level-headed - you don’t know if he’s happy or not! What you see is what you get and that’s why he has respect from everyone in the game</p>
