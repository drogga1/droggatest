<blockquote>
  <p>[Brighton defender Shane Duffy has praised former Everton team-mate Romelu Lukaku] The goals he has got show what he can do. We were both at Everton at the same time. He’s done brilliantly and is now regarded as one of the top strikers in the world. He’s still young. He has a lot of pressure on him trying to deliver goals for Manchester United - it’s not an easy task.<br /><br />[On Chris Hughton] I can’t speak highly enough of him, for what he has done for me personally, and at this club to bring them from where they were when he first came in to now. Now he is getting the credit he fully deserves. He’s brought my game on to a level I thought I could probably never get to. He has both sides of it - the coaching and managing a squad. He is very level-headed - you don’t know if he’s happy or not! What you see is what you get and that’s why he has respect from everyone in the game</p>
