<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Shrewsbury Town chief executive Brian Caldwell has hit out at <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, accusing the Reds of breaching FA Cup rules while costing the League One club money in the process]</b> You will recall our incredible come back in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup Fourth Round tie live on BBC with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to draw 2-2 back in January. Immediately following the match, the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> ruined what should have been a wonderful moment for our Club by making public statements that he and all of his first-team would not attend the replay at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, effectively ruining what should have been not just financially but for the players and fans a wonderful achievement and a very special occasion. We struggled to believe that his statements had no effect on the replay being televised and we are convinced that LFC broke <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup rules by not ‘fielding their strongest team’ in the return fixture. This had a knock-on effect of STFC not getting anywhere near the financial rewards that were to be expected from an FA Cup Fourth Round replay including a potential live TV fee against the World and European Champions and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> Champions (elect).<br /><br />In February we put a complaint in to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> about the alleged rule breach but unfortunately and quite unexpectedly we were informed that this was dismissed last week (four months on). This without doubt resulted in a much lesser occasion for our players and fans as well as the financial reward that would have been expected from LFC playing their strongest team and abiding by <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup rules</p>
