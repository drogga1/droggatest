  <p><b>[As a result, ATM gained promotion back into the Super League, and with kick off the new season edging closer, Marlon is still confident of haunting defenders]</b> I do not set personal targets. What is important is the performance of my team. Of course, as a striker, my job is to find the net as many times as possible. I had a great season in 2012 <b>[…]</b> I want to make it better in the upcoming season. Yes, at 36, I am classified as an old man but as long as I can score goals against younger players, I will continue to haunt them. I do not want to think about the other teams. It will only make me nervous. I am, however, aware we will face a tougher competition in top-tier football. I only want to think about Forces. A few key players have left but we have beefed-up our squad with quality players. I am confident we will be very competitive</p>

  <p><b>[Marlon Alex James has praised Selangor and national fullback, Mahali Jasuli, after his excellent performances in recent games]</b> Mahali can play in England, Spain, USA, Germany, and Italy. <b>[I’m]</b> really impressed with his improvement and with better coaching, he can get better</p>

  <p><b>[Marlon James eyes MSL golden boot in Owona’s absence]</b> It is a bonus for me and I want to keep scoring goals for the team. We as a team will keep performing well</p>

  <p><b>[ATM striker Marlon Alex James remains unfazed ahead of the second leg of the 2013 Malaysia Cup semifinal against Kelantan in Kota Bharu this Friday]</b> I don’t really study my opponents before matches. I just make sure that I play my ‘A’ game. Obinna is a good player and football is not just about beating a player to win the match but we have to beat the entire Kelantan team<br /><br /><b>[Marlon, who is a joint-second top scorer in the competition with seven goals, also debunked the assumption that the Gladiators are a two-man team that heavily depend on him and his strike partner and skipper Hairuddin Omar]</b> It’s quite disrespectful to brand us a two-man team as all the players work hard and we have always played as a unit. We will go out for a win and we will play an attacking game, which is what we have done throughout the season. We conceded early in the first leg and it’s something we can’t afford to do in the return leg<br /><br /><b>[Nonetheless, Marlon is well aware of the threat that the Red Warriors possess, especially on their home ground]</b> Kelantan were the best team last season in terms of consistency but I believe we were the best football playing team. The tie is far from over and we are targeting an upset in Kota Baru.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[According to his interview from Astro Arena, he claimed that there are no passion in football, and not just at club level, but also at the federation level]</b> No one is passionate about the game, not at the clubs, not at the federation. There is no professionalism in the game. From the head to the state (FA), players as well as the youth.<br /><br />Kedah is more like the islands. I’m a ‘Kampung’ boy, so my wife and I really love living there.</p>
