Whenever we got a goal back we conceded another soon afterwards, and always through bad mistakes<br /><br />We had tired legs and in the end we lost 6-3 but what hurts me more is that we had the opportunity to win and put City nine points behind us and, instead, they are three points behind us. That is very difficult to swallow because we played a team that was not unbeatable. We conceded many goals but honestly we could have scored six as well<br /><br />We had three offsides given against us which were not offside, and a penalty turned down.

He was absolutely in a different physical shape today, even if he played nearly 90 minutes on Wednesday night against Chile. It was quite a tough game but sometimes when you have two tough games like that it helps you to recover<br /><br /><b>[Now, as Wenger explained, the strain had been mental, not physical]</b> I think it affected him mentally too much, the penalty he missed against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. He had the feeling he let the team down at a very important moment of the game. That affected his performance very much. Sometimes a psychological wound is like a physical one. You can talk and talk and talk, but it takes time. I think he is over it. He has a good opportunity to show on Tuesday night how good he is<br /><br />I would like him to find the right balance between being a provider and finisher. At the moment the balance is a bit detrimental to the finishing. But he is pacy, much quicker than people think he is, and with that technical quality and pace, if he gets into the right areas, with the service he has, he can score goals.

  <p><b>[On <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>]</b> I was very lucky to find <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> already in the squad when I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. You do not find a player like that everywhere you go, It was a blessing, a gift when I arrived.<br /><br />I knew of his class before I arrived of course. I remember playing against Inter as manager of <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> when he was there, and I saw him as a young player at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> too, but you only really find out about a player when you work with him every day.<br /><br />A lot has been said about Dennis over the years; about his class, about his intelligence - his remarkable intelligence - about his vision, basically you can never say enough about the player. But the one thing which is a real example for youngsters is that <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, and I have worked with him for ten years don’t forget, until the last minute of his final training session, he did not lose his concentration or dedication for one minute. For me that is more remarkable than anything else. Because the talent he got when he was born, and then developed it, but what I respect more was that every single day of his career, for 20 years, until the last minute, he never made a pass in training without thinking about it, or without putting every part of his brain into it. That’s something that I consider virtually impossible to do, such is the level of dedication needed, but he did it, and that’s what made him not only a super-talented player, but a remarkable player who always had 100 per cent concentration throughout every session. That is a dream for a manager because I have seen many talented players, and some average players, give only 50 per cent concentration in training.<br /><br />In England you have a phrase that Dennis was always a pleasure to watch. Well let me tell you that behind that pleasure for the viewer, was a great deal of dedication and hard-work from Dennis.<br /><br />When you have a player like that as a coach, you do not tell him how to play football, you just try to fit him into the team in the way which allows him to express his talent to the maximum potential. He was always a striker, yet not a striker - a midfielder yet not a midfielder, so I always felt that the second striker position was his natural position. He was at ease there, he knew when to drop off, and he could just smell out the game. He had instinct and super intelligence. As well as his talent, he had super, super intelligence.<br /><br />His role in the team changed over the years. When I first arrived he was a goalscorer, and obsessed by scoring like may forwards are, but slowly he became more obsessed by the team and by how much he can provide. He understood that he could score less, but help the team score more. But he still loved to score goals, and great goals too. I think my favourite would probably be the one he scored against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> at Filbert Street, his third in a fantastic hat-trick. It was something exceptional…<br /><br />You will see today the respect that he had within the game, because I think that every player who played with him would love to be involved today. The players that will be playing in this game think a lot of Dennis, they respect him so much as a player and he was a joy to play with</p>

Our performances have been top quality but we have not had the results we could have had. We have not been gifted luck<br /><br />He’s at the level now that not many people expected him to be. He has not played for England since 2016, that means everyone gave up on him. But now it would not be a surprise if he gets a call up. He deserves great credit</p>

He’s a tough, tough guy. Tough worker. He’s mentally strong. I’ve said many times in this job you can never give up, no matter what happens for you and always be ready in case you’re needed. Not many can do that, but Mathieu can do that.</p>

  <p><b>[Why Arsene Wenger won’t be sacked even if Arsenal get knocked out of the Europa League]</b> We played since January in a very difficult environment for different reasons. Some obviously that you know about, and that is very difficult for the group of players to cope with that. Some other reasons we will talk about another day. But the psychological environment for the group of players was absolutely horrendous. It has been difficult. Certainly, my personal situation has contributed to that.<br /><br />Honestly, nobody knows really what’s going on. Diplomatic relations between England and Russia at the moment are a bit complicated. I just hope it won’t affect both ties and that it will not affect the supporters. Or the Russian people who come over here and and the English people who want to travel there.</p>

It was not dramatically different before. He was a good player. But I think in the last seven or eight games he played, he was not completely free with his knee. Unfortunately, in our job you need your body and when you are not 100 per cent you cannot play well. It’s good to have him back because it gives us different opportunities. Danny <b>[Welbeck]</b> is more a guy who goes behind, whereas Lacazette is more combination play, so to have both options is important.</p>

They just think, ‘Let’s play’ and Reiss behaves like that.<br /><br />Eddie Nketiah is a striker who has a nose for the goal but he’s not only a goal-getter. And that’s what is interesting with him. He has good physical qualities, he can combine with others, he can integrate a collective game at a very high level and, as well, he can get on the end of things and score in front of goal. So he has basic exceptional qualities but you have to show that in a consistent way. The next step for him is mental. Show me that you’re motivated every day, show me that you’re hungry to become the player that you can become</p>

  <p><b>[Go Murakami on Arsene Wenger]</b> It was in 1995 and it was my first job as an interpreter. I heard he came from Monaco and I didn’t know about him but everyone said he was a good manager from France. I was told ‘Go, you’re in charge of Mr Wenger’. I spent one-and-a-half years at Grampus Eight and I was always with him, he was a hard worker. At the beginning we had a seven or eight game losing streak, it was difficult at first. He <b>[Wenger]</b> knew everything about nutrition and the mental side, how to control the players. He tried to adapt to the Japanese style, we were just at the beginning in terms of football. He took it back to the basics, how to control, trap the ball and pass. Everybody said it was like going back to school but he thought we needed these things - the basics are important. With nutrition he controlled everything. If vegetables or orange juice had more acid - they were out. Before the day of the game we would have pasta or chicken without any oil. After we kept winning everybody got used to his ideas and understood how it benefited the team. I think Japanese players are disciplined. They follow all the instructions and show respect through saying ‘arigato gozaimas’ <b>[thank you very much]</b>. He likes the culture and the people.<br /><br />For me he is like a philosopher. He speaks with proverbs. For example, he would say ‘Go, football is very simple but playing simple is very difficult’ - I love this kind of thinking. I have lots of memories with my time with Arsene. He’s always watching videos and analysing the next game. Boro Primorac <b>[now Arsenal first team coach]</b> was here too, he’s a kind of funny guy. Wenger is more strict. I went to Arsene’s house one day and he was watching a video, Boro was sitting down next to us eating some snacks. I said ‘boss, can I go home’, he said yes ‘OK, go home’. The next day I asked Boro how long Arsene was watching football for and he told me he stayed up until three in the morning. He’s always like this. Boro stayed with him in the same apartment and he was always joking. My memory of Arsene is that he’s always watching and thinking about football. Football wise he’s a specialist and he likes it<br /><br />He said ‘Go, it’s a good suit. But you haven’t changed’. That photo was four years ago at Arsenal’s Asia Tour. Pixie was the head coach and Wenger was here, there was a press conference and I was translating. It was a great moment<br /><br />Carlos Queiroz came in later on and I also interpreted for him but the results were not so good. I left <b>[Grampus Eight]</b> in 2003 and spent four years abroad as a coach in Palau - a small country in the pacific. In 2008 Pixie <b>[Stojkovic]</b> became head coach and Grampus asked me to come back to Japan to be interpreter as I knew him as a player. We were in a good way after that and first we won the championship in 2010, after that in 2011 we only needed one point to become champion but finished as runners-up. From my point of view the basics are important. My vision is the same as Arsene’s, I follow his instructions. He spent 20 years at Arsenal. To stay more than 20 years in one club is amazing and I think his personality and character is loved by staff and directors. Once he’s familiar with somebody he always takes care of that person, that’s why I still keep contact with him</p>

I’ve met people for whom I am the only Arsenal manager they have known, so now this is a good opportunity for the club to have new people and new ideas to continue to move the club forward, which is what I’ve tried to do my whole life.<br /><br />One day I’ll go up to heaven and He will ask ‘What have you done with your life?’ The only answer I have will be, ‘I tried to win football games’.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger is looking forward to being able to shout at the next manager of Arsenal]</b> I would be happy to sit in the North Bank. It depends. Do I work somewhere else or not? What do I do? In the job I do will I be free on the day Arsenal plays? I’d be happy to be in the North Bank. If you can offer me a ticket. The positive of that is I can shout at the next manager!<br /><br />Fortunately in my job you learn to disconnect from yourself. You don’t analyse anymore how you feel. For 20 years I forgot about me and just cared about the problems I had to sort out. I must say when you’re such a long time in the job and people ask how do you feel you think ‘why does he ask me that, I don’t know how I feel.’ I have to learn to reconnect with myself now I have more time. It’s a new start for me.<br /><br />Sometimes to make people happy you have to go somewhere else. I want to make people happy because I have a certain idea of the game, the football to be played. My ambition was always to win with style. When you’re a big club you have that responsibility. For the supporters to have a special experience when they come to the club. That was always my target: making people happy</p>

I have always been close to those in charge of PSG - I advised them to buy the club because I was convinced there were great things that could be done in a city which loves football. They have worked well and made a good start. I think people are too hard on them, too demanding. PSG just won all four national trophies in France and it’s not enough, apparently. But you cannot build a club with the idea that if you don’t win the Champions League then it’s a failure.<br /><br />It’s just too soon to know what I will do next. I haven’t even emptied my desk yet and in a way I am still in a state of shock. I am going to give myself until June 14, the day the World Cup begins, to decide. The question is do I still want to coach, to be on the bench, or is it time to take up different functions? The one thing I can say for sure is that I will continue to work. But do I want to continue to suffer as much? I want to continue to defend my ideas of football, that’s for sure. Spontaneously, I would say I still want to coach but I can’t really say that yet for sure<br /><br />My type of loyalty probably doesn’t exist anymore. Maybe the dinosaur I became was the last symbol of times that have changed. We are today in a society which is so quick to reject. There is no time to build, to construct, always this demand for results immediately. Maybe people wanted to manifest that too. It was nice to see some of the recognition, I admit. When I arrived, you know, I was a complete unknown and I have always had the impression I am representing my country in a way. In a land where there has always been so much animosity between the English and the French I am proud to have achieved certain things and perhaps to have opened doors for other French coaches.

At least I did not disgust them with the job. That’s not bad.<br /><br />A championship more easily reflects the real value of the teams. Modern life means that there is more concentration of players in a small number of units. We see it on an economic level and on a football level. The best players are grouped today in five or six clubs. The unpredictable side has a disappeared a little in modern football</p>

And that will be the big problem for all the big clubs.<br /><br />I would say it was three main factors. First of all, Alex Ferguson was a huge personality in the game. His importance at the club and his quality, of course, was dominant. After that, I believe when he stopped it was also the end of a generation, coinciding with Ryan Giggs retiring.

It was six months later, less than a year, he went from Bremen to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> but it was a done deal before.

  <p><b>[Wenger remembers <a href="alexander-hleb.html">Hleb</a> fondly, though, and seems to have little regret over his handling of the attacking midfielder]</b> He was a guy you’d want to make happy. Sometimes it seemed like something had cracked inside him, and I felt like I was responsible for helping him, for supporting his talent. You see, being a manager allows you to influence people’s lives, which is great, you can influence them positively, not negatively.

We should value quality management and encourage it. I am <b>[also]</b> in favour of opening things up to more investment, which FFP does not allow for. The clubs that dominate Europe today are those that were built and made investments during an era where FFP did not exist. FFP prevents emerging clubs who want to invest from doing so.

Controlling club management rigorously, yes, verifying where funds are coming from, yes, but we need to encourage people to invest in football. FFP must become more flexible and facilitate investment. We must control clubs in their way of doing things but not tell them how to do it. If the club believes that it is not taking any risks with its balance by buying a player for €150 million, what is the problem?</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger has warned of the perils of top French clubs being sold to foreign investors]</b> Unfortunately, I think we’re witnessing a reverse phenomenon today. For example, take French clubs. They are gradually falling into hands of people who are not real builders for the future of the club, but rather investors who are seeking to earn money very quickly. And we can see in France today that there are a lot of problems at this level because the clubs are dissatisfied. Supporters feel that the primary goal is not to build a good team but to achieve financial gain<br /><br />Perhaps we should create a Club Purchasing Ethics Commission to see what the real intentions of the people who buy are clubs are.

What I regret is that when I did fight, teams were allowed to do what they wanted and these teams are in charge now in strong positions in the league. They are, of course, now supportive of financial fair play because it suits them. But they do not want anybody new to come in and be a threat. Maybe we should open the door by being very cautious ethically. To create more flexibility in results, maybe we have to open the door or make sure everyone has the same resources. It is too predictable now. For example, in France, before the championship starts, everybody asks, ‘Who will be second?’<br /><br /><b>[Wenger believes solutions can be found which will help to level the playing field, but the Frenchman is not convinced that an American model can be followed]</b> Yes, I’m convinced <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> is conscious of that.

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s chief of global football development, has painted a stark picture for many lower league clubs in England, warning that they face a difficult fight for survival due to the coronavirus pandemic]</b> It is very concerning because we live in a world today which is mainly focused on regrouping the elite and you know well the cases in England. In England, the lower leagues are dying. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> will survive, I don’t worry about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You worry more out of the 92 clubs you have 65 clubs that lose money and behind closed doors, if they open up the stadium they lose money to play the game. It is absolutely where football has to rethink, how we can help these clubs to survive. We need an elite but we need a basis that young players have a chance to play and where we have to get these people to survive<br /><br /><b>[After the liquidation of Bury earlier this season, which means that League One has been played with 23 clubs, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> has forecast that many more clubs could potentially go to the wall]</b> I believe so, there are too many clubs in trouble and there is not enough money there to help them enough to survive. Then you get to a stage where a club with some professional players will not be capable to be professional anymore and we will lose plenty of clubs. We calculated that overall football will lose 20% of income, football let’s say can make £45 billion ($57bn) in turnover in the world. The loss will be £10-14 billion that is approximately the amount that football will lose. That means that if you look at the wage structure in most clubs it is between 60-80% of turnover. So that means only the player’s wages can sort that problem out. I would say that it has made the weak clubs weaker and the strong clubs stronger</p>
