Whenever we got a goal back we conceded another soon afterwards, and always through bad mistakes<br /><br />We had tired legs and in the end we lost 6-3 but what hurts me more is that we had the opportunity to win and put City nine points behind us and, instead, they are three points behind us. That is very difficult to swallow because we played a team that was not unbeatable. We conceded many goals but honestly we could have scored six as well<br /><br />We had three offsides given against us which were not offside, and a penalty turned down.

He has a good opportunity to show on Tuesday night how good he is<br /><br />I would like him to find the right balance between being a provider and finisher.

You do not find a player like that everywhere you go, It was a blessing, a gift when I arrived.<br /><br />I knew of his class before I arrived of course. I remember playing against Inter as manager of Monaco when he was there, and I saw him as a young player at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> too, but you only really find out about a player when you work with him every day.<br /><br />A lot has been said about Dennis over the years; about his class, about his intelligence - his remarkable intelligence - about his vision, basically you can never say enough about the player. But the one thing which is a real example for youngsters is that <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, and I have worked with him for ten years don’t forget, until the last minute of his final training session, he did not lose his concentration or dedication for one minute. For me that is more remarkable than anything else. Because the talent he got when he was born, and then developed it, but what I respect more was that every single day of his career, for 20 years, until the last minute, he never made a pass in training without thinking about it, or without putting every part of his brain into it. That’s something that I consider virtually impossible to do, such is the level of dedication needed, but he did it, and that’s what made him not only a super-talented player, but a remarkable player who always had 100 per cent concentration throughout every session. That is a dream for a manager because I have seen many talented players, and some average players, give only 50 per cent concentration in training.<br /><br />In England you have a phrase that Dennis was always a pleasure to watch. Well let me tell you that behind that pleasure for the viewer, was a great deal of dedication and hard-work from Dennis.<br /><br />When you have a player like that as a coach, you do not tell him how to play football, you just try to fit him into the team in the way which allows him to express his talent to the maximum potential. He was always a striker, yet not a striker - a midfielder yet not a midfielder, so I always felt that the second striker position was his natural position. He was at ease there, he knew when to drop off, and he could just smell out the game. He had instinct and super intelligence. As well as his talent, he had super, super intelligence.<br /><br />His role in the team changed over the years. When I first arrived he was a goalscorer, and obsessed by scoring like may forwards are, but slowly he became more obsessed by the team and by how much he can provide. He understood that he could score less, but help the team score more. But he still loved to score goals, and great goals too. I think my favourite would probably be the one he scored against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> at Filbert Street, his third in a fantastic hat-trick. It was something exceptional…<br /><br />You will see today the respect that he had within the game, because I think that every player who played with him would love to be involved today. The players that will be playing in this game think a lot of Dennis, they respect him so much as a player and he was a joy to play with</p>

You worry more out of the 92 clubs you have 65 clubs that lose money and behind closed doors, if they open up the stadium they lose money to play the game. It is absolutely where football has to rethink, how we can help these clubs to survive. We need an elite but we need a basis that young players have a chance to play and where we have to get these people to survive<br /><br /><b>[After the liquidation of Bury earlier this season, which means that League One has been played with 23 clubs, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> has forecast that many more clubs could potentially go to the wall]</b> I believe so, there are too many clubs in trouble and there is not enough money there to help them enough to survive. Then you get to a stage where a club with some professional players will not be capable to be professional anymore and we will lose plenty of clubs. We calculated that overall football will lose 20% of income, football let’s say can make £45 billion ($57bn) in turnover in the world. The loss will be £10-14 billion that is approximately the amount that football will lose. That means that if you look at the wage structure in most clubs it is between 60-80% of turnover. So that means only the player’s wages can sort that problem out. I would say that it has made the weak clubs weaker and the strong clubs stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger on Football]</b> Football can show the way to the rest of society how we should behave. We speak a lot about racism now. Football is based on merit only - not on who you are, where you come from and how you look. That’s a good way to teach the world how we should behave. Sport, in general, is a great leader in that way</p>

  <p><b>[Wenger responds to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> chairman question after being linked with return to Emirates Stadium]</b> Sir Chips is somebody who had been there for 15 years, took over from Peter Hill-Wood, so I think the club have been respectful with the work he’s done there. It would be something special to see <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> come onto the board. I don’t think so somehow, I think he’s said recently he doesn’t want to do that, never saw himself as someone who would sit on the board, but they could do a lot worse. I feel that would be almost the perfect answer for <b>[Stan]</b> Kroenke, the young <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Josh Kroenke</a>, he needs that older person perhaps around, someone with the experience. Other people would think that it would be intimidating for <b>[Mikel]</b> <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> - I don’t think so. If you’re a successful-type personality, you don’t really mind who else is in the building. You embrace that knowledge that could come in through the door. So I would applaud that if <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club were to bring <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> onto the board<br /><br /><b>[Picking the cream of that crop is a thankless task]</b> Well you had <b>[Dennis]</b> <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> … erm, yeah, too many! I don’t know. You know, because it’s always difficult to choose one</p>
