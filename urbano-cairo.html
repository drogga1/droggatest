  <p><b>[Andrea Belotti could snub a €100 million summer transfer to a Manchester United or Chelsea]</b> Will he remain at Torino next season? I honestly don’t know. Let’s just say that we were very clear with each other. When his agent asked me, obviously, for an increase in salary after last season’s excellent campaign and the stunning start to this one, I said fine, I’ll improve the contract, but at this point let’s add a release clause worth €100m only for abroad.<br /><br />The agent in his negotiation was wondering whether to extend the contract, but I pointed out that if we weren’t going to extend it, why should I pay him more? So we found a happy medium - I extended the contract, but if the player did such extraordinary things as to tempt a foreign club to come in with an offer of €100m, I’d allow him to leave. Having said that, Belotti could also turn them down and refuse to go, in which case I’d treat him well and probably guarantee even more improvements to the contract. For now, that is the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Torino president Urbano Cairo admits that Joe Hart’s mistakes were an issue this season for his club]</b> Hart made a few mistakes, especially when coming out for the ball. He is an important goalkeeper. We probably didn’t expect so many mistakes from an England international … but he did some good things, too.<br /><br /><b>[On Andrea Belotti]</b> I have not received any requests for Belotti. There are certainly many scouts observing Torino games, and I imagine Belotti, both Italian and foreign. I said many times, if Belotti stays for another year, he’ll be doing a great thing for himself and for us. Next year he could consolidate his status, score maybe 30 goals and get to the World Cup.<br /><br />Andrea is a humble lad who wants to learn, so we’ve got a great rapport. I think this has been a good campaign, but there are regrets seeing some of the teams ahead of us slowing down now. We could’ve challenged for Europe, but in any case, we scored 65 goals, launched promising young players and Sinisa Mihajlovic built a good team. We chose this strategy of focusing on young players when Giampiero Ventura was the Coach and we’re continuing it with Mihajlovic. Lyanco will be with us next season and he was tracked by Juventus and Atletico Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[On Andrea Belotti]</b> He has a contract with Toro until 2021. I would only sell him for €100m, but even then he can refuse. The most important thing is what he wants, regardless of the release clause, and I believe he wants to stay.</p>

  <p><b>[Torino have not received any formal bids for Andrea Belotti amid interest from Chelsea]</b> He has a €100m release clause. For now no-one has come in for him. I’m glad he’s with us and I hope he can stay. I want to understand his intentions, I’m happy for him to stay, not least because we’ve given up interesting options which didn’t reach the €100m clause. They weren’t real offers, but there were contacts. I don’t want to imagine a Toro without Il Gallo.<br /><br />Tonight I’ll have a meal with <b>[coach Sinisa]</b> Mihajlovic and <b>[sporting director Gianluca]</b> Petrachi, we’ll talk about everything and you understand we also have to think about this possibility. The clause is there, but we have to understand what he thinks because it’s important for a player to stay with the desire to do well.<br /><br />I want to talk to him, I want a confirmation. I don’t think it’s possible to sell in Italy, where there isn’t even the clause. Andrea is an extraordinary lad, he has undeniable qualities.</p>

  <p><b>[Tighter controls could be introduced on non-EU players]</b> <b>[The amount of foreigners]</b> is not the problem. he number <b>[in Italy]</b> is similar to those of the other important European countries. What we need to do is create the right conditions for the talents to emerge, by investing in their training and that of their coaches. I’m in favour of the second teams to get the boys to mature. And then it would be right to introduce a rule that obliges the clubs to allocate a share of the turnover to the academy investment</p>

  <p><b>[On Andrea Belotti]</b> It’s the market that dictates the prices. If <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho is sold for €160m then perhaps, if Belotti goes back to doing what he usually does, <b>[his release clause]</b> will be low.</p>

  <p><b>[Ola Aina will spend the season on loan at Torino from Chelsea]</b> Our staff were already looking for a prospect like Ola Aina, a wing-back who is physically strong, quick and has stamina, able to play on either wing. Aina is an ambitious young player who Torino can improve. In the name of the club, I am happy to welcome him to the Granata</p>

  <p><b>[Torino vs Juventus]</b> We’re not sixth by chance, despite some points thrown away along the road. That’s down to us and also some decisions which penalised us. I’d say the important thing is to maintain maximum concentration and the desire to do well. We need to prepare well all week and go on the pitch with the desire to show that Toro is a team with quality and solidity, which we’ve already shown. We’re in good form, but now we have a very difficult game against a Juve who have won all but one, which was a draw. I saw a good Toro at San Siro though.</p>
