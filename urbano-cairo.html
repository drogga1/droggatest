  <p><b>[Urbano Cairo was furious with Nicolas Nkoulou after the match but insisted he did not want to sell the him]</b> I said at the beginning of the transfer window that I will keep everyone, so he <b>[Nkoulou]</b> will also stay. Maybe he has other ideas, but he has a contract for another two years. Nkoulou must apologise to the club and to his team-mates. I even met with his agent at Forte dei Marmi: we were talking all afternoon and even talked about adding a buyout clause <b>[to his contract]</b>. Roma aren’t even able to contact our players: there is a written agreement that, if they do, they have to pay a penalty of €900,000</p>
