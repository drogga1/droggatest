  <p><b>[John Herdman speaks after being announced as the new head coach of the Canadian men’s national team after spending over six years in charge of the women’s national team in the same country]</b> From a motivational side, you get to that point in your career where you’re starting to feel ready for a new challenge, and the stars sort of aligned in some ways that some opportunities were presented in front of us … They were very good opportunities. I had some tough decisions to make and that led towards keeping a future here in Canada. I’d always sort of talked about moving into the men’s game, and one of those opportunities came up, and a pretty prestigious opportunity came up on the women’s side. That was a big decision, as well. It’s been a crazy two months for us … <b>[but]</b> I felt I was ready for a new challenge, and this is where it’s ended up. I’m bloody excited</p>

  <p><b>[Canada men’s national team head coach John Herdman, on Sinclair, who became the top scorer in international football history this week]</b> If you come to this country, there’s one woman that everyone knows: it’s Christine Sinclair. It was an absolute gift in my life to have the chance to work with her</p>
