  <p><b>[John Herdman speaks after being announced as the new head coach of the Canadian men’s national team after spending over six years in charge of the women’s national team in the same country]</b> From a motivational side, you get to that point in your career where you’re starting to feel ready for a new challenge, and the stars sort of aligned in some ways that some opportunities were presented in front of us … They were very good opportunities. I had some tough decisions to make and that led towards keeping a future here in Canada. I’d always sort of talked about moving into the men’s game, and one of those opportunities came up, and a pretty prestigious opportunity came up on the women’s side. That was a big decision, as well. It’s been a crazy two months for us … <b>[but]</b> I felt I was ready for a new challenge, and this is where it’s ended up. I’m bloody excited</p>

  <p><b>[John Herdman knew what he was getting into when he took over the Canada men’s national team in January]</b> The list of names started to come up and you started to realize we had a lot of youth players playing in top academies across Europe. While our MLS academies are doing a fantastic job also, we’d see players that were competing week-in week-out in training environments and playing on weekends against top, top European youth teams. It became quite enlightening. You started to realize you’ve got players at Auxerre, Olympique Lyon, Gent to name but a few. It was exciting to see what we actually had in our system<br /><br /><b>[On qualification in 2022]</b> There are parts of this team that I’m really comfortable with when I look to the future and I’m projecting out four years time and we’re in a World Cup playing against tough opposition, top opposition, which of the players are going to be able to cope with that level of competition now or in the future. We’re starting to look at that now with some of the selections<br /><br />This isn’t jumping on an airplane and having a six-course meal and a limo ride and some swag from Canada soccer and all the rest of the things that coaches might have tried before. This is genuinely working with the player to help them make the right decisions for themselves, and that might be Ivory Coast. I think that’s part of our commitment as coaches. We have to look at the best for these players and give them the time to work through things. It’s got to be the right decision for them. It has to feel like it’s time to come and play for Canada<br /><br /><b>[The tournament gave Herdman a foundation to build on]</b> What we do know is that if we bring our best youth players together that they can compete. What was even more surprising was the level of our MLS academy players. There were players there that have developed through the MLS system through their academies that showed that we were on par if not at times ahead of our European counterparts. I just think it’s exciting when you look at what our academies are doing in Canada but also what our players are accessing overseas. It’s then about the work that we do in camp to bind this group together. I thought in four days of training, bearing in mind we hadn’t been together for a year and a half, it showed that our methodology can take us to places where we can not only compete but win against these teams like we did against Turkey</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico preparing for actual challenge against upstart Canada]</b> This is just a great opportunity for Canada to come in as an underdog. You know, the last six games, we’ve been expected to win every game we’ve played, so this is the first time in my tenure where you get a chance to actually feel like an underdog, David and Goliath. It’s a nice feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico vs Canada. Coach John Herdman is aware of the challenge facing his side on Wednesday]</b> Mexico have characteristics similar to the team they had at the 2018 World Cup but Martino has players who move very well. It’s amazing to see them work. It’s a damn good team and I hope one day Canada can reach its level. I think Mexico is always the team to beat in <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a>, they’re full of stars and it’s the biggest soccer country in North America, it’s a good opportunity to come in as the underdog, it’s a David against Goliath</p>

  <p><b>[Canada looking to restore passion, respectability to program as Gold Cup run continues. They’d just lost a tight 3-1 battle to Mexico days prior]</b> We lost, but we learned.<br /><br /><b>[on Doneil Henry’s statement]</b> I think that’s what I envisioned, that someone could speak that passionately and clearly about why they wear that jersey. I’m not sure I’ve heard that before<br /><br /><b>[The players are there, and they have talent, but the idea of hosting World Cup 2026 hangs over everyone’s head. All that’s needed is a plan, and Herdman believes moments like Henry’s statement and the ongoing Gold Cup run are pieces of a big puzzle that ends with one thing: respectability]</b> This isn’t just a day-by-day or tournament-by-tournament. We’re looking at 2026. My federation made a commitment which was an eight-year contract. That’s the reality. When I signed for the project, you know as a coach that it’s fickle, and if I’m not the right man, then I’m not the right man, but I’m working my ass off and my staff are connecting this country. We’ve been in every <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> club, every province, I’ve worked with every U15 player in the country. We’re doing things a little bit differently where we’re connecting our country in a way so that if I eject out tomorrow, I’ll know I’ve done something a little bit different and left it a little better than I found it<br /><br /><b>[Herdman says there is a level of belief in this program that better days are ahead]</b> I wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning if I didn’t believe that was possible. We just take it every game at a time. We work back from the final, and we’ve done our planning to see the USA in Chicago. That’s what a coach has to do. I have to look that far ahead and work back from that moment. It’s just a game at a time now. If we are ever going to catch up or overtake Mexico or the USA, it’s got to mean more to us than them when we get into those big moments. A lot of people are clear on the meaning, and that really does galvanize the group. There have been some tough moments where we haven’t been able to cross that cavern, we just haven’t been able to cross that in the past. That’s clear, and we’ve got the talent, so there are no excuses any more</p>
