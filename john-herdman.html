  <p><b>[John Herdman speaks after being announced as the new head coach of the Canadian men’s national team after spending over six years in charge of the women’s national team in the same country]</b> From a motivational side, you get to that point in your career where you’re starting to feel ready for a new challenge, and the stars sort of aligned in some ways that some opportunities were presented in front of us … They were very good opportunities. I had some tough decisions to make and that led towards keeping a future here in Canada. I’d always sort of talked about moving into the men’s game, and one of those opportunities came up, and a pretty prestigious opportunity came up on the women’s side. That was a big decision, as well. It’s been a crazy two months for us … <b>[but]</b> I felt I was ready for a new challenge, and this is where it’s ended up. I’m bloody excited</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a>]</b> He’s like an iceman. He’s able to slow it right down in the box, wait for the keeper to sit down, and pick his moments. That’s a real special quality in a striker</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico preparing for actual challenge against upstart Canada]</b> This is just a great opportunity for Canada to come in as an underdog. You know, the last six games, we’ve been expected to win every game we’ve played, so this is the first time in my tenure where you get a chance to actually feel like an underdog, David and Goliath. It’s a nice feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico vs Canada. Coach John Herdman is aware of the challenge facing his side on Wednesday]</b> Mexico have characteristics similar to the team they had at the 2018 World Cup but Martino has players who move very well. It’s amazing to see them work. It’s a damn good team and I hope one day Canada can reach its level. I think Mexico is always the team to beat in <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a>, they’re full of stars and it’s the biggest soccer country in North America, it’s a good opportunity to come in as the underdog, it’s a David against Goliath</p>

I think he was asking how my new role was going. So I just said, ‘Yeah, it’s going well.’ I asked him if he’s enjoying his job. That was it. We got on with the game. He won and I lost.</p>

  <p><b>[Canada looking to restore passion, respectability to program as Gold Cup run continues. They’d just lost a tight 3-1 battle to Mexico days prior]</b> We lost, but we learned.<br /><br /><b>[on Doneil Henry’s statement]</b> I think that’s what I envisioned, that someone could speak that passionately and clearly about why they wear that jersey. I’m not sure I’ve heard that before<br /><br /><b>[The players are there, and they have talent, but the idea of hosting World Cup 2026 hangs over everyone’s head. All that’s needed is a plan, and Herdman believes moments like Henry’s statement and the ongoing Gold Cup run are pieces of a big puzzle that ends with one thing: respectability]</b> This isn’t just a day-by-day or tournament-by-tournament. We’re looking at 2026. My federation made a commitment which was an eight-year contract. That’s the reality. When I signed for the project, you know as a coach that it’s fickle, and if I’m not the right man, then I’m not the right man, but I’m working my ass off and my staff are connecting this country. We’ve been in every <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> club, every province, I’ve worked with every U15 player in the country. We’re doing things a little bit differently where we’re connecting our country in a way so that if I eject out tomorrow, I’ll know I’ve done something a little bit different and left it a little better than I found it<br /><br /><b>[Herdman says there is a level of belief in this program that better days are ahead]</b> I wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning if I didn’t believe that was possible. We just take it every game at a time. We work back from the final, and we’ve done our planning to see the USA in Chicago. That’s what a coach has to do. I have to look that far ahead and work back from that moment. It’s just a game at a time now. If we are ever going to catch up or overtake Mexico or the USA, it’s got to mean more to us than them when we get into those big moments. A lot of people are clear on the meaning, and that really does galvanize the group. There have been some tough moments where we haven’t been able to cross that cavern, we just haven’t been able to cross that in the past. That’s clear, and we’ve got the talent, so there are no excuses any more</p>
