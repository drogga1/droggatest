  <p><b>[Forgotten wunderkind Alen Halilovic can be Milan’s midfield spark]</b> A surprise signing, a young talent: AC Milan have signed Alen Halilovic to build on the desire to create a stronger and younger team. Alen has great potential, though his career has not yet flourished. He arrives in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> fully motivated, ready for that boost following his spell in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. Left-footed, 169cm tall and 69 kilos, he is a creative and technical player with playmaking ability in the tight space, capable of operating throughout the midfield as no.10, winger or holding midfielder offering, therefore, a range of tactical solutions to <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Rino Gattuso</a>. The young Croatian tends to move in from the right threatening in the middle with abilities to break through the line. Welcome, Alen!</p>
