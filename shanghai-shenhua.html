  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua have dished out a heavy sanction to midfielder Qin Sheng after his red card for deliberately stamping on Axel Witsel]</b> The extremely irrational behaviour of Qin Sheng has severely tarnished the image of this club, the football of Shanghai and even Chinese football. All the efforts made by others have gone down the drain because of him. Given Qin Sheng was shown a yellow card in the season opener, we intentionally warned him over his poor on-field behavior before the game. However, our repeated warnings have not prevented this happening. I don’t think he was just caught up in the heat of the moment. Instead, it’s a flagrant violation of the club management.</p>

  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua has come out strongly in defence of Carlos Tevez, who was quoted as saying that Chinese players are not good and won’t be able to compete in 50 years]</b> The language used by the French media is misleading and cynical, which distorted the meaning of Tevez’s words. Tevez said he had not watched the video footage of the interview and its subtitles yet, but the headline led us to believe that the interview is being exaggerated and blown out of proportion.<br /><br />Tevez’s comments were taken grossly out of context. He has clarified to the club that he has no intention of disparaging Chinese football and Chinese players. Tevez was just attempting to paint a realistic picture of the current state of Chinese football. He also hopes for a better future for Chinese football</p>

  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua have denied making an offer for Australia coach Ange Postecoglou]</b> Our current coach is Wu Jingui. He and his backroom staff retain the full backing of the club as we are inching toward the end of the season. Even if we feel the need to find a foreign coach in the future, the club perhaps will not appoint a guy who is on the same level as the Australian coach.</p>
