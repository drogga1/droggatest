At moments like this, it’s important that we all take on our responsibilities and do what we can to help. Whether it’s the president, our players and staff, our fantastic former players and all our fans, from Rome and elsewhere, everyone who has contributed has helped pay for these new intensive care ventilators, which will help save real lives. We’re not giving up though and now we want to raise even more money, surpass our €500,000 target and buy more essential hospital equipment</p>
