  <p><b>[Fred has been backed to become a key player for Manchester United]</b> He’s a big talent and he’s still developing. I have no doubt he’ll have a great future at Manchester United. But, of course, he needs time. It’s totally different from what he was used to in Ukraine. He needs a period to adapt, to the club, to the league. It’s a totally different situation.<br /><br />In my opinion, his position is in a midfield two as the more attacking of two central midfield players. He is physically strong and mobile, with the quality to build play, but he is also very good at breaking from midfield and going to either side of the attack</p>

  <p><b>[Shakhtar Donetsk coach Paulo Fonseca claims that Manchester City do not have weaknesses]</b> Manchester City do not have weaknesses. Playing against Manchester City is always very complicated because they are one of the best teams in the world. We are going to show our strengths and show you game - we have to make sure we don’t make any mistakes against a team such as City.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he would one day take up the opportunity to coach in the Premier League]</b> Of course. It’s a dream for every coach - it’s a big league, maybe the best in the world. I would like to come here one day and manage a team. I don’t know when that will be but I believe that it will happen<br /><br />With regards to the team I would like to manage… I’m currently with Shakhtar. This is the team I want to manage. My heart and soul are with them but maybe in future I’ll consider managing another team</p>

It was my wish, and everyone is happy. With him staying, it is clear to see that the room for <b>[Patrik]</b> Schick to show his quality is reduced. There are players who need more time to adapt to our game and he is one of them. <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> is also young and has yet to understand a lot of things, but he is still growing. Just like <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Nicolo Zaniolo</a>, who is destined to become one of the best Italian players.

I’ve always said that winning alone isn’t enough. I want us to be dominant, to have control of the ball, to play in the opposition half. I won’t abandon that</p>
