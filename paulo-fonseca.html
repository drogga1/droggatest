  <p><b>[Paulo Fonseca speaks dressed up as Zorro, a promise he made if his team advanced to the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League knockout round]</b> This is the most joyful press conference of my career. I feel great joy. I think not only Shakhtar’s supporters but all Ukrainians have to be proud of our team</p>

  <p><b>[Genoa vs <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a>. Roma manager Paulo Fonseca has spoken of his delight at seeing star forward <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Edin Dzeko</a> sign a new contract this summer]</b> I am very happy with <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a> staying, though it was something I always believed would happen. It was my wish, and everyone is happy. With him staying, it is clear to see that the room for <b>[Patrik]</b> Schick to show his quality is reduced. There are players who need more time to adapt to our game and he is one of them. <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> is also young and has yet to understand a lot of things, but he is still growing. Just like <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Nicolo Zaniolo</a>, who is destined to become one of the best Italian players. He too must grow and work hard, especially in terms of tactics, but I am sure he can be an important player for us now.<br /><br /><b>[They host Genoa at Stadio Olimpico and, while their opponents avoided relegation by a single goal last season, the new boss is keen for his side to apply themselves and get off to a strong start]</b> They are a strong team, but I’m sure the team will immediately give a positive response. I’ve always said that winning alone isn’t enough. I want us to be dominant, to have control of the ball, to play in the opposition half. I won’t abandon that</p>

  <p><b>[Roma: Officials admitted <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> penalty was a mistake against Monchengladbach]</b> It is difficult to accept a decision like that. All the players are devastated. We faced the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> leaders and were in constant control of the game, despite the difficulties. It’s really hard to accept this, we deserved a different result</p>

The adaptation <b>[to Italian football]</b> was very easy for him. He’s a boy that everyone loves in the club because he is a great professional. I would like Chris to stay. We are speaking. I don’t know if it is possible because of the situation with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but I would like so much for Chris to stay here with us because he is very important. He is a great player, a great man with a great attitude every day and for all of these reasons I would be very happy if Chris stays<br /><br />Mkhi during this season got some injuries but he is returning now and he is proving his quality. Let’s see. He is a player with great decisions on the pitch and I would also like to keep Mkhi in our team.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma boss Paulo Fonseca ‘surprised’ by how quickly <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> has adapted to Serie A]</b> He surprised me. He’s a defender that had never left England and he arrived in a league very demanding of tactics, where details make the difference. Chris adapted very quickly. He’s an extraordinary guy, very intelligent. He has characteristics that I really appreciate in the centre. He’s fast, nearly unbeatable in one-on-ones. He has a great ability to read the play and anticipate. He was very important for this club. If possible, I would like him to stay. He’s a great professional and person, it’s a pleasure to have him here with us</p>

  <p><b>[Roma coach Paulo Fonseca insisted he would be trying everything to keep defender <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> at the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> club]</b> I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too. I know he wants to stay, let’s see what happens. He’s an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room. It’s not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn’t good, but he has been amazing<br /><br /><b>[on Nicolo Zaniolo]</b> He’s not just a wonderful natural talent, he’s a player who improved considerably this year. I used to say he was like a wild man, following his instincts, but now he understands the game, understands the space, understands the decision-making. I have no doubt that in a few years he’ll be one of the best players not just in Italy but in all of Europe</p>

Henrikh also wants to stay. However, it must be said that everything is on pause right now. We still need to talk to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I want to keep working with him.
