<blockquote>
  <p>[Mbappe’s father fed up with Real Madrid rumours] Before I read and watched everything, but not any more. It’s like a chocolate cake, if you eat too much, then you get an upset stomach. Sometimes, there’s misinformation too. OK, Kylian is a public person, but I do not understand that there are everyday things about him. It’s embarrassing. I am no longer able to do things that were done every day. Sometimes we need peace. Today, everyone knows this name. I feel like I’m the same as before. Everyone here is like that, my children, my wife. We know where we come from. We stay the same. We almost kept the same friends<br /><br />[When asked who his favourite players are] My first is Kylian and my second is Mbappe! Even if I take away the fact that he’s my son, seeing him play gives me so much pleasure. I loved the Brazilian Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Pele, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff and Ronaldinho. I love Neymar too. To see him play with Kylian guarantees a show. I go to the stadium to get my eyes full and get up from my seat! He has realised all my dreams: to become a professional and win the World Cup. I am also proud that he wears the No.10 for France. It was my number and also his at AS Bondy. I wish for him to grow and win things but they are no longer dreams<br /><br />Kylian can play everywhere, because his palette is complete. Do not lock him in a box, he can play as a striker, on the right or left. It is especially necessary that he keeps this freedom of movement that he gets at PSG or France. He can do better in front of goal. Against Lyon [in October] we talked a lot about his four missed opportunities before he scored four. But who has scored eight goals this season in a match? With Kylian we trivialise the exceptional! If he wasn’t my son, I’d say he’s doing incredible things for his age</p>
