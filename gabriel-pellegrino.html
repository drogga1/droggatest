  <p><b>[The club’s president Gabriel Pellegrino believes <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s appointment is the boost <a href="gimnasia.html">Gimnasia</a> require following their poor start]</b> I have a huge satisfaction because I found a father figure for the club. We talked about the details and he was constantly talking about the fans. It’s all positive. We are in a difficult time and we need someone really strong. We thought of him, we called him and he was the first to say that he wanted to take care of this moment for Gimnasia</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> leaves <a href="gimnasia.html">Gimnasia</a> after just two months at the helm]</b> I spoke with him yesterday and he told me that if there was unity, he would continue, but that failed. We informed him and he did not want to continue. <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <b>[his assistant Sebastian]</b> Mendez and his coaching staff were men of their word. We arrived together and we left together. He was more up to the task than us as leaders<br /><br /><b>[He explained the reasons behind <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s departure in more detail]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> stopped working today, he’s no longer <a href="gimnasia.html">Gimnasia</a>’s head coach. <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> worked in a collective scheme. He said he was here to add, not to rest. He’d love to continue, but he wants unity. It just didn’t happen. Today’s meeting failed. There will be elections on Saturday. <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> gave his will and he gave his time. He had an enormous will. There will be elections on Saturday and <b>[the candidates]</b> will look for a head coach</p>
