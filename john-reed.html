  <p><a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a>’s Bhumjaithai (‘Pride of Thailand’) party featured his beaming face on posters emblazoned with green marijuana leaves during the campaign for the March 24 poll<br /><br />In an interview with the Financial Times this week, <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a> would not confirm reports that he had demanded the prime minister’s post in exchange for joining a Pheu-Thai led government. However, Mr Anutin confirmed he was interested in the top job<br /><br />While Thailand’s two main political camps are trying to line up their next coalitions, Mr <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a> is biding his time. He says he will not commit to either camp before the coronation and the announcement of final results in early May<br /><br />A former senior official in Mr <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>’s party, Mr <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a> was also described as a ‘close associate’ of Thailand’s new king by a US diplomat in a 2009 leaked WikiLeaks cable. Speaking to the FT, Mr Anutin said he objected to the notion of ‘democratic’ and ‘military’ political camps, which he described as ‘just wordings’<br /><br />Mr <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a>’s stock is rising not just figuratively, but literally. Shares in Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, the family company he formerly headed - and which is building Thailand’s new parliament building - rose the day after the vote. Shares linked to Mr <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>’s businesses dropped<br /><br />If Mr <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a> is keeping his plans discreet, that is because a lot could still happen before the May 9 announcement of official results. Thailand’s junta-appointed Electoral Commission might disqualify individual MPs or even entire parties. MPs might be lured to defect to rival camps, as they have in past political cycles</p>
