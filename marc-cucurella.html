  <p><b>[Barcelona have taken up the option to re-sign Marc Cucurella from Eibar in €4 million deal]</b> FC Barcelona has made effective the repurchase clause of the player Marc Cucurella, who last season played on loan at Eibar, for 4 million euros. The Basque club exercised their purchase option at the end of the 2018/19 season for a value of 2 million euros. Cucurella left on loan to the Mendilibar team with the aim of gaining experience in the elite of Spanish football. For the Basque side he has played 33 games: 31 of those in league and two in the Copa del Rey. In addition, a player trained in the Barca academy scored two goals, one in each competition. Curiously, the goal he recorded in the league was in the last game of the championship against Barca in Ipurua. In the Cup, he scored in the return match of the round of 32 against Sporting Gijon.</p>

In that case Barcelona would be entitled to 40 per cent of the player’s future transfer fee from Getafe to another team. Barcelona would like to publicly express their gratitude to Marc Cucurella for his commitment and dedication and wish him luck and success for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Getafe defender Marc Cucurella denied allegations he racially abused <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s Eder Militao during their <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> match on Satur]</b> I would like to clarify that in no moment did I insult Militao. My words were ‘Shut your f*cking mouth’. I apologise if anyone has been offended by this. These are the only statements I have made and that I will make about it. Thank you</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea tracking <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> loan star Marc Cucurella]</b> I think that at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, which is a big club, the important thing is to win in the end. Maybe they don’t have the patience that they <b>[once]</b> had. As a cantera player, which I am, they don’t give you the chances you deserve. I don’t like it because I expected they would be more confident in the youth academy (cantera). In football, the important thing is to win. Winning is more important than having patience</p>
