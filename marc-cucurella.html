  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have taken up the option to re-sign Marc Cucurella from <a href="eibar.html">Eibar</a> in €4 million deal]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> has made effective the repurchase clause of the player Marc Cucurella, who last season played on loan at <a href="eibar.html">Eibar</a>, for 4 million euros. The Basque club exercised their purchase option at the end of the 2018/19 season for a value of 2 million euros. Cucurella left on loan to the Mendilibar team with the aim of gaining experience in the elite of Spanish football. For the Basque side he has played 33 games: 31 of those in league and two in the Copa del Rey. In addition, a player trained in the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> academy scored two goals, one in each competition. Curiously, the goal he recorded in the league was in the last game of the championship against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> in Ipurua. In the Cup, he scored in the return match of the round of 32 against Sporting Gijon.</p>

Maybe they don’t have the patience that they <b>[once]</b> had. As a cantera player, which I am, they don’t give you the chances you deserve. I don’t like it because I expected they would be more confident in the youth academy (cantera). In football, the important thing is to win. Winning is more important than having patience</p>
