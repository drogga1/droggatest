  <p><b>[Rugani’s girlfriend in shock as she reveals details about <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender’s coronavirus symptoms &amp; isolation]</b> Four days ago Daniele recorded three mild fever lines, he was at a temperature of 37.5. He asked to be checked and, the next day, the test was positive, but he already had no fever, nor did he have or had a cough or something else. So we didn’t expect it. We don’t have a clue how the infection happened. From the moment he saw the fever, he decided, with a great sense of responsibility, to remain in isolation to protect me, the team and the people with whom he could have come in contact. We often speak and video call him, I feel quite calm. He is well and without symptoms. His other colleagues, without symptoms and who have not done the swab, have chosen to be at Continassa, to avoid contact with families<br /><br />Both Daniele and I had been in voluntary isolation for a week, although we were doing very well, going out only for his work needs or for necessary commissions. He played his games, even on Sunday, as scheduled, but he followed all the precautions prescribed. Even in this difficult moment, our love gives us great strength</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender Daniele Rugani’s girlfriend Michela Persico on terror of Covid-19 diagnosis while pregnant]</b> I am fine now, but fortunately I only had mild symptoms: loss of smell and taste, a fever, fatigue. Compared to many others, Daniele and I were very fortunate. The biggest issue was the fear about this pregnancy and being alone, seeing as Daniele was ill too and self-isolating, not to mention worry for my family. My parents in Bergamo told me they constantly heard ambulance sirens in the streets and nothing else. This was still the start of March. The day I found out Daniele had tested positive, I just assumed that I was too. It was like my brain short-circuited, thinking of all the ways this could affect the baby. This is such a new virus, we don’t know the effects and consequences for pregnancy, so it was terrifying for those first few days and I was calling everyone for advice. Fortunately, after being reassured by the doctors, I managed to keep my head. I created a daily routine for the lockdown, which in my case lasted for 35 days. I was particularly stunned by the support I received on social media, not just from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> fans. He too felt the affection that goes beyond just being part of a football team.<br /><br />I want to reassure everyone by saying that I am fine. I have always been quite well. I have not had the serious symptoms mentioned. I consider myself lucky even if it was a heavy blow also because I was the first in our environment <b>[and]</b> served to raise the awareness of all those who had not understood the seriousness of the problem</p>
