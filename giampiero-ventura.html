  <p><b>[<a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>’s return to European competition has been largely successful but coach Giampiero Ventura was not in the mood to let anyone off the hook after their surprise 2-1 defeat to HJK a fortnight ago]</b> I apologise to the fans who came this far to watch the team. You can’t expect to win in Europe if you can’t even win a tackle. I think that everyone needs to rediscover their humility and get their feet back on the ground. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone, without exception. We’ve made many sacrifices to get where we are now, so it’s not acceptable to have a game like that.<br /><br /><b>[Coming 20 years after they last reached this level, then, the stage means more to <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> and their supporters than most]</b> if we look back to three years ago, it’s remarkable to see <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> enter Europe through the main door. It is satisfying for everyone: the fans, the city that rushed to the stadium tonight and will continue to do so. We brought back the desire to cheer on the team, the pride in these colours</p>

  <p><b>[On Mario Balotelli]</b> you cannot expect to be treated with respect if you do not offer it yourself. No-one can argue with Balotelli in terms of his ability. It is all the other stuff. So far there have not been positive signs. The facts tell you that Balotelli must change, we hope he does because it would be a shame if he threw his talent away.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Italy head coach Giampiero Ventura believes that Serie A is now more important thanks to the arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlo Ancelotti]</b> Napoli? The field will tell us how long Ancelotti will need. Carlo arrived after three years of important football done by Sarri with a fierce organization. Now he must be given time to build on that and then put his ideas in place. he two comebacks <b>[wins over Lazio and Milan]</b> were excellent results, but the games were won with so many difficulties. He might not make 91 points this season, but he could still win a competition. The ‘anti-Juve’? It’s too early to say who it will be. Napoli conceded three goals against Sampdoria, Roma and Inter have already lost. Juventus have just won seven league titles and bought Cristiano Ronaldo, so they are the ‘super-favorite’. Napoli must return to challenge Juventus, but need some time. Ancelotti and Cristiano Ronaldo give prominence to the Italian championship and that is a very important factor for the whole movement.<br /><br /><b>[Ventura was also keen to stress the quality at Ancelotti’s disposal]</b> <b>[Piotr]</b> Zielinski? He can still improve. <b>[Marko]</b> Rog is a player who has yet to fulfill his potential in Italy, but he is interesting. <b>[Lorenzo]</b> Insigne? I believe that Sunday in Genoa was not his best game, but it is an isolated episode. He usually misses just one game a year, he is an important player for Napoli and Italy<br /><br />I wish the national team well with great affection. I hope it’s the beginning of a rebirth for an Italy that needs it. I’ll watch Italy versus Poland tonight</p>
