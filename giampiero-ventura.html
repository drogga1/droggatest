  <p><b>[<a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>’s return to European competition has been largely successful but coach Giampiero Ventura was not in the mood to let anyone off the hook after their surprise 2-1 defeat to HJK a fortnight ago]</b> I apologise to the fans who came this far to watch the team. You can’t expect to win in Europe if you can’t even win a tackle. I think that everyone needs to rediscover their humility and get their feet back on the ground. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone, without exception. We’ve made many sacrifices to get where we are now, so it’s not acceptable to have a game like that.<br /><br /><b>[Coming 20 years after they last reached this level, then, the stage means more to <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> and their supporters than most]</b> if we look back to three years ago, it’s remarkable to see <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> enter Europe through the main door. It is satisfying for everyone: the fans, the city that rushed to the stadium tonight and will continue to do so. We brought back the desire to cheer on the team, the pride in these colours</p>

  <p><b>[Italy coach Giampiero Ventura believes Marco Verratti is wasted in Ligue 1 because Paris Saint-Germain are never put in difficulty]</b> I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again; Verratti is absolutely a good thing for Italy. The problem is that he doesn’t play in Italy, but in France. The rhythms are different; the strength of his team is so high that he never gets put in difficulty. He must get used to putting 100 per cent into matches.<br /><br />The talk around Donnarumma is the same as when <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon started. They’re players who, without wanting to increase the pressure, are pre-destined for greatness thanks to their technical, physical and mental quality. With Donnarumma it’s not his saves, but the calm he transmits when he plays</p>

  <p><b>[Injury woes hit Balotelli but door for the national team is opened]</b> Balotelli’s not a player for a training camp - we’re talking about a player who has played in a World Cup. I want to talk to him. Between now and March I will have the time to go and see him personally. Once he’s worked on himself, he will be considered like everybody else.</p>

  <p><b>[Italy coach Giampiero Ventura would be open to iconic goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon joining his backroom staff following the 2018 World Cup]</b> As someone helping out the side and helping select players, why not? If he’s never coached before he would be an unknown quantity. He is a reference point on and off the pitch; for his team-mates, for me, for the Federation. It would certainly be a mistake if Italy did not make the most of his presence.<br /><br />We will put in a great performance in Spain, I am convinced of it. I am more worried by the March encounter with Albania, as we are forced to win that and have only four days to prepare. I don’t know if at that stage we’ll be ready to use the 4-2-4 system. If we go to the World Cup, then I’m convinced we’ll surprise many people during that tournament, I have no doubts. The problem, which is true for everyone, is getting there</p>

  <p><b>[Torino striker Andrea Belotti has the hunger and desire to improve of professionals such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon]</b> I do not think so. Belotti is someone who wants to get to the top, he is hungry, he wants to improve. The great champions are those who continue to push themselves, like <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo or Buffon.<br /><br />When I was in a club I dedicated a lot of time to this, because it’s hard to give up on a player. In that sense I had huge victories but also defeats, as with <b>[Juan]</b> Sanchez Mino in Torino. He did not understand how the fans would challenge him. It’s different with a national team. At a club I would have the opportunity to work on Pelle. Here I do not</p>

  <p><b>[On Mario Balotelli]</b> you cannot expect to be treated with respect if you do not offer it yourself. No-one can argue with Balotelli in terms of his ability. It is all the other stuff. So far there have not been positive signs. The facts tell you that Balotelli must change, we hope he does because it would be a shame if he threw his talent away.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s handling of Matteo Darmian has been branded bizarre by Italy national team coach Giampiero Ventura]</b> I’d also add Darmian, he doesn’t have permission from United to come to us until June 5. A bizarre choice, as he’s been stopped since the Europa League final, and I think we’ve lost him for the Uruguay game too. A bizarre choice. We’re not going to cry though, we’ve lost many players over the months but locally we have a lot of youngsters thanks to the training camps. <b>[Andrea]</b> Conti, <b>[Danilo]</b> D’Ambrosio and <b>[Leonardo]</b> Spinazzola will be important for us in the upcoming matches.<br /><br />It seems that <b>[Andrea]</b> Barzagli, <b>[Leonardo]</b> Bonucci and <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini will all play on Saturday and I’ve spoken to all three of them. They’re playing on June 3 and then we play June 7, a very important friendly for us and I asked them all to give their availability. The response was total availability, but there’s a further step from being available to being healthy. We hope all three of them will be there, because <b>[Alessio]</b> Romagnoli and <b>[Daniele]</b> Rugani have physical problems. I want to compliment them though, they’ve been a surprise even for me. They’re an example for the younger ones</p>

  <p><b>[Balotelli faces final audition in bid to become Italy’s leading man again]</b> It is not his talent that is questioned. It is a discussion of having a motive other than scoring a goal or not. All the coaches who had him had problems with him. Balotelli cannot be just any other player. There are players who cannot be extras, they must be actors. This is his case. The day when he will do it, the door will be wide open for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Ventura continues to argue against the player’s personality, suggesting that he bears a burden that is not necessarily visible on the field]</b> The way of judging this is not whether Balotelli is scoring goals, the problems are elsewhere - the rest of Balotelli. We need to consider the 360 degrees of Balotelli, but right now our priority is qualifying and then we will have a further four to five months to think about it. I can’t put the World Cup on the line right now - I need certainties.</p>

We’ll meet in the next days, we’ll discuss about it. There are many things to talk about. Until the play-off we were progressing as foreseen, then we’ve been unlucky not to score against them <b>[Sweden]</b>. I apologize to the Italians. Only for the result, not for the effort we put in every game.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Italy head coach Giampiero Ventura believes that Serie A is now more important thanks to the arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlo Ancelotti]</b> Napoli? The field will tell us how long Ancelotti will need. Carlo arrived after three years of important football done by Sarri with a fierce organization. Now he must be given time to build on that and then put his ideas in place. he two comebacks <b>[wins over Lazio and Milan]</b> were excellent results, but the games were won with so many difficulties. He might not make 91 points this season, but he could still win a competition. The ‘anti-Juve’? It’s too early to say who it will be. Napoli conceded three goals against Sampdoria, Roma and Inter have already lost. Juventus have just won seven league titles and bought Cristiano Ronaldo, so they are the ‘super-favorite’. Napoli must return to challenge Juventus, but need some time. Ancelotti and Cristiano Ronaldo give prominence to the Italian championship and that is a very important factor for the whole movement.<br /><br /><b>[Ventura was also keen to stress the quality at Ancelotti’s disposal]</b> <b>[Piotr]</b> Zielinski? He can still improve. <b>[Marko]</b> Rog is a player who has yet to fulfill his potential in Italy, but he is interesting. <b>[Lorenzo]</b> Insigne? I believe that Sunday in Genoa was not his best game, but it is an isolated episode. He usually misses just one game a year, he is an important player for Napoli and Italy<br /><br />I wish the national team well with great affection. I hope it’s the beginning of a rebirth for an Italy that needs it. I’ll watch Italy versus Poland tonight</p>
