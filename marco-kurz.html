  <p><b>[On Ersan Gulum]</b> Gulum is an experienced player who’s established himself in Turkey, where he’s captained the club and is clearly a leader. I knew of him from his time in Europe with Besiktas, and I have no doubt he will be an excellent signing. I spoke with a teammate of Ersan’s during his time at Besiktas, a German player, who praised him highly. This is the first signing we have completed and is just the beginning of what we are aiming to do. I am sure we will have more good news in the coming days.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory confirmed the appointment of Marco Kurz as their head coach for the next two seasons]</b> It’s an honour to be named as head coach of Melbourne Victory, a big club with a strong history, passionate fanbase and true drive for success. I’ve got to know Melbourne Victory from afar, and had tremendous respect for them during that time, so it is exciting to join the club. During the interview process we had aligned beliefs about the direction forward which was very important. I can’t wait to join the team and get underway.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory has continued their recent recruiting spree with the signing of Austrian playmaker Kristijan Dobras on a one-year contact]</b> Kristijan is an exciting player who has developed a strong game in Austria. We see a great opportunity for him to come to Victory and not only grow his game further, but also add a spark to our midfield, which we spoke about during our discussions with him. Thankfully these discussions with Kristijan proved very positive, and we’re lucky to have signed him for the season ahead</p>
