  <p><b>[Former Manchester United youth coach Paul McGuinness believes Angel Gomes has the potential to become a player of similar quality to Barcelona icon Andres Iniesta or Man City string-puller David Silva]</b> He’s a real talent. If he was Brazilian, people would be raving about him and, if he was six inches taller, people would be going mad. I suppose that’s our country. People doubt players if they’re short in stature but no-one is doubting Andres Iniesta or David Silva. He’s got the potential to be that type of player and, in England, you just don’t get many players like that. If you play him with better players, he’ll get better himself and create chances for them. You don’t want to build him up too soon but I’m sure they’ll handle all that at United..<br /><br /><b>[Joel Pereira, Demetri Mitchell, Scott McTominay and Josh Harrop all lined up against the Eagles]</b> It was a fantastic achievement for the players and the academy to have all those players on the pitch at once. They’ve beaten a full-strength Crystal Palace team, so they’ve shown great potential there. What a fantastic start for Josh Harrop. He is the type that makes things happen and he certainly did that on his debut, scoring a fantastic goal. He’s that type of instinctive player that can open up a defence and make something happen. And Scott McTominay, a year or so ago, was six inches smaller. He’s had a massive growth spurt and is now showing real potential</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford may be an exciting striking option at Manchester United, but former youth coach Paul McGuinness has revealed that he once wanted to play like Pirlo]</b> We decided, myself, Warren Joyce and Colin Little, that he was a very good footballer. He could be a No.10, a winger, beat people, he used to drop off into midfield. There was one tournament where he wanted to play like Pirlo. But we saw his potential to be a striker. We worked on his body shape, different runs. He’s a really, really intelligent lad in terms of football. He picked it up very quickly.<br /><br />Marcus can score all sorts of goals, but to be a goal-scorer you need more of the Ruud van Nistelrooy type of goals. If it hit the goalkeeper - there was Ruud. If it hit the bar, post, deflected - he was there. Marcus has got a bigger range, but he needs more of those</p>

  <p><b>[On Marcus Rashford]</b> He joined us aged eight, and he’d been playing in the street with his mates, playing constantly. He carried on, even though he was at United. We didn’t stop him! He’d play with Jesse Lingard, Paul Pogba, Ravel Morrison <b>[seniors by a full five years]</b>, it was 13-a-side and looked like a scramble, so you had to have the quick-witted skills and the techniques to survive. You had the future world’s most expensive footballer playing with you when you were 12, doing tricks, flicking it over heads, one-twos, drag-backs, the things he does now. Marcus was a privileged spectator, right next to Pogba on the pitch, learning by osmosis.</p>
