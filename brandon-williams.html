  <p><b>[Brandon Williams is looking to provide assistance to <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> at Manchester United]</b> It’s a really proud thing for me and my family. I know what I’ve achieved but I want to keep on playing and play as many games as I can for this club. In the position I play in, you need that energy and to be strong on the physical side of the game to get up and down the pitch, and also to help defend and attack. Attacking is a big part of my game. I love driving forward and giving energy to the team and helping with our attacks. When I make those runs, you might make a run for yourself with the ball or you might make a run for someone else by creating space for somebody like Marcus <b>[Rashford]</b>, or whoever is on the wing, to go in there and create their magic<br /><br /><b>[Williams added on his memories of seeing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and Co savour Champions League glory in 2008]</b> We got tickets for pretty much every home game. So I was watching the likes of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. It shows you what the top level is like and you just want to play with these types of players. In 2008, I remember being at home <b>[for the final]</b> and my nana was telling me to go to bed but I was like: ‘I need to watch the penalties’ and, obviously, we all know what happened. My mum and dad went out to watch the game but my nana was babysitting me. She kept telling me to go to bed but I don’t think she knew what game it was, and how big it was. I told her I needed to watch it!</p>

  <p><b>[Brandon Williams has become the latest <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player to salute the qualities of Paul Pogba]</b> You’re not getting near him, his arms are so strong, he’s so tall. You won’t see the ball, all you see is the guy in front of you and he’ll be gone<br /><br /><b>[He added on Daniel James]</b> He’s unbelievably quick, it’s impossible to get near him, he will leave you</p>
