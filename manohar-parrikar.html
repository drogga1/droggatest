  <p><b>[Goa CM Manohar Parrikar - We will ensure that no stone is left unturned in the preparations]</b> Goa is known for its love for football and we will ensure that no stone is left unturned in preparations for the tournament. It will be a wonderful opportunity for all Goans to witness a spectacle such as the World Cup. I am pretty excited to see the way the stadium has shaped over the last year - since I last came here, it played host to the World Cup Qualifiers and from the reports, I gauge that the authorities here did a great job at it. Also, the meeting with the Chief Minister was pretty fruitful - he assured us of continued support and that all requirements would be met leading up to the tournament.<br /><br />Goa had the advantage of having hosted the AFC U-16 Championship 2016, which helped in having the infrastructure very advanced by September last year. On the infrastructure front, things are almost ready but we now need to go into the finer details of all the operation plans such as security, transport, health, promotions etc. We will keep working with the authorities of the State Government just as we have done for the past two and a half years to make sure that all the responsibilities for the state are complied with</p>
