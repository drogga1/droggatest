<blockquote>
  <p>[Wellington Phoenix are targeting nine points from their three consecutive home games as they prepare to face Melbourne Victory] We said to the guys [before the Central Coast game] ‘look, you’ve got a 10-day spell now where this could be a season-defining moment. Three points tonight sets you up ready to take on Victory in the game in hand’. I think at the end of it, if we can get results, you’re back in the top four and the season’s turned on its head and everyone saying the Phoenix are where they need to be. That’s not looking forward too early, that’s the reality of having a game in hand. But no doubt tomorrow night’s going to be a tough game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Wellington Phoenix co-coach Chris Greenacre has indicated Football Federation Australia should revisit its heat policy after Sunday’s A-League match was played in extreme heat] They’re absolutely shattered, as you can imagine - very, very tough conditions for both sets of players. Had a couple of guys at half-time being ill through heat stroke. We enquired about the kick-off being a little bit late just to get the best out of the players but it wasn’t to be.<br /><br />Factors like the heat really set us back a little bit and I just think it could probably be addressed better. I think after today it probably will be addressed but again, it’s about the welfare of the players. That’s what matters … the players are the ones out there putting their necks on the line</p>
