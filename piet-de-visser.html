  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> urged to re-sign perfect <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> by Abramovich advisor]</b> Ake should have played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> by now. He’s so good. How often does he not score with his head? He has timing and insight. I hope they buy him back. That boy is perfect for them and he has played with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>.<br /><br /><a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is a special type. He doesn’t talk much, but he is a boss. He sees football well. He took <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>, who was still at Vitesse, to <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a>. Mount was the man immediately. Defender <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a>, also from the youth of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, also went to Derby. Fortunately, the trainer <b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>]</b> was taken away from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this summer by <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, because he did not play the young boys either.<br /><br />Frank has given six or seven of the academy boys opportunities. That is the future. Class. The academy in Cobham is beautiful, with thirty fields, kitchen, hospital, everything. Tip top. The coaches at the academy are among the best youth trainers in the world. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> took a few of them into his staff at Derby. They are back now and know all those young boys. That works perfectly. I hope that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> stays 10 years</p>
