  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world]</b> We all know Ronaldo the player and personally I’ve always considered him the best in the world. I’ve always preferred him to Messi. What I’ve discovered is that he’s an exceptional person, a humble lad with extraordinary personality which he transmits to everyone. It’s infectious. It’s in that regard that I’ve always preferred him to Messi. I remember the final of the European Championships when he had to go off injured in the first half, but on the bench he was an added coach<br /><br />Juve was already an extraordinary club in terms of a winning mentality, with nothing to learn from anyone, but the arrival of Cristiano brought something more. Just think about his red card against Valencia: the fact he’s won five Champions Leagues and five Ballons d’Or and cried because he was sent off tells you a lot about his passion. I went over to him to tell him to be calm, because he’s the best in the world and I didn’t want to see him cry. He didn’t deserve it because it really was an unjust red card. Having Ronaldo close is an example for the youngsters, even at a great club like Juve. You have to be intelligent, you’re training with the best player in the world and if you’re lucky enough to do that you need to try and steal a few things. It’s like riding a wave, he has helped me and still is. He’s an example to follow, obviously staying firm on your personality and objectives.<br /><br />I think Real Madrid have lost a lot, when the best in the world leaves you feel it. I think he deserves the Ballon d’Or, he also shone at the World Cup. He scored a hat-trick against Spain and not everyone can do that. Modric is a champion, but if I have to judge an individual award then, in my opinion, Cristiano made the difference in everything, also on a human level. He’s a step above the others, over the past 10 years he and Messi have been so superior that there’s no contest. When they retire someone else can win</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Bernardeschi believes that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Maurizio Sarri​ would be a good fit at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I don’t express myself, we have a club with great decision makers, therefore whoever arrives means that they’ll be at the top and bring something more for each player. As a player I can say that <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is a valid profile to me, but I don’t know if he will be the next manager.<br /><br />He will be celebrated as deserved, because he won a lot and that isn’t easy. He has his ideas that led <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to many successes<br /><br /><b>[Bernardeschi is on international duty with Italy at the moment]</b> It’s an extraordinary group, made of many young talents. We’re all in agreement to say that this is the Italy we wanted, made also of men and it’s very important. Mancini worked a lot on this<br /><br /><b>[One young player who has caught the eye for both Italy and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> is <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a>]</b> He needs to grow without pressure and responsibility, he needs to still make mistakes to find his balance and work in the right way. It would be wrong to give him a label</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> interest a source of pride for Federico Bernardeschi but <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have given no transfer hints]</b> Does <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s interest make me proud? Absolutely, yes, that’s normal. When top clubs like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are looking for you, it’s a source of pride, but I’m already part of a top club<br /><br /><b>[He added on the exit speculation]</b> Honestly, nobody ever said anything to me, they never talked about the market. I have a contract with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, it’s not a problem for me, I’m fine in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>. We’ll see what happens later but the club has never spoken to me. In fact, the opposite was always the case when some questions about my possible sale were asked. And this made me very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Bernardeschi speaks about the work of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic]</b> I get goosebumps talking about the doctors and nurses, and everyone who is risking their lives to help their neighbour. I have to say what our healthcare workers have done and continue to do is a miracle of humankind</p>
