  <p><b>[Igor Biscan talks about expectations for the national team at Russia 2018]</b> I believe we have the quality and experience. For this group of players this is their last chance to do something big, the public expects this generation to come close to the famous side of 1998. I think they have enough quality to replicate 1998, if you analyse the teams they play at, the roles they have in those team you will understand they are on the same level as those players were</p>

  <p><b>[Igor Biscan admits he wasn’t good enough for the Reds]</b> The main reason is that I wasn’t good enough, to be honest. It took me some time to really adapt and understand and find my place in the team, within the team in this type of football. It wasn’t easy and I didn’t play much. I just needed to change some things about the way I think about the game; then I did it and when I did it, when I changed some things, of course I still had to be patient and give myself a little bit of time. Then it was OK, I felt much better and felt I could play much easier<br /><br /><b>[Biscan was a regular under Rafa Benitez]</b> When he first spoke to me, he asked me which position I preferred to play and I told him I’d like to play as a central midfielder or defensive midfielder. Maybe that was the main thing for me, because I felt I could give my best in that position and it proved to be true. This season <b>[2004-05]</b> was really famous in the end; it was a special season, and for me personally as well because I would say that season was the only season out of the five I was there that I really, I believe, played the level at the top of my abilities. At least that’s what I thought. And I contributed the way I expected myself to contribute during the whole period I was there. Sometimes it just happens like this. Fortunately for me, I managed to reach at least that level of quality that I could play a part</p>
