  <p><b>[EA Sports creative director Matt Prior explains the ability for creativity within the Volta game mode will be revolutionary for the FIFA franchise]</b> I think Volta offers user creativity like we never have offered before in FIFA. That’s creativity in the sense of your look, the vanity but also when you create your team, you pick a logo, you pick a venue and the creativity around the venue makes such a big difference. The Volta community itself will be ever expanding and changing. The teams you play with and against, whether online or offline, is user generated content. So there will be people coming to the game throughout the cycle. They will create avatars and teams and they will go into the pool of teams you can play against<br /><br /><b>[Prior revealed Volta will be following the FIFA Ultimate Team live service model]</b> We will be doing live seasons, so we will be introducing more vanity items over the course of the game’s cycle. What you see on the disk is not just what is going to be available. If you stick around through the game, you will see the new content drop. We will also be introducing tournaments as well throughout so you will get new tournaments on the map. The days of a game not changing once it’s been packed and shipped are long gone. A lot of games, such as FUT, offer the live service model and it’s something gamers have come to expect. I think Volta is a great forum to do that because the fashion of the in-game players is a big part of it.<br /><br /><b>[For fans of famous clothing brands, EA Sports is also planning to collaborate with big names in the fashion industry to create game-related content]</b> We will be looking to work with brands such as adidas so there is an opportunity for some unique content within the game but also opportunities in the real world</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA 20 creative director Matt Prior explains there were fictional features added to FIFA Street]</b> If you think FIFA Street, that was much more of an arcade kind of experience – you had the gamebreaker where you built up a bar and you had a superpower kind of thing. So playing Volta is a very much different experience. Back in the day, if you were proficient at FIFA Street, and then went to the 11-v-11 game it was almost as if you had to re-learn the mechanics of the game because it was that much different of an experience. For Volta, we wanted to base it around the <b>[the standard FIFA]</b> engine for a number of reasons<br /><br /><b>[Armed with this fact, Volta aims to be a game mode that can be played interchangeably with the standard 11-v-11 game]</b> We went out and spoke to these real-world street players and the first thing I asked them was, ‘What’s the difference between the street game and the pro game?’. It was reassuring to hear that obviously there is the skills, flair and subculture of the look and fashion, but at its heart when you drill down into it, it’s still fundamentally football. It’s about winning, it’s about teamwork, it’s about passing, shooting, etc. We want people who are FIFA veterans of the 11-v-11 game to come to Volta and be able to play it and not have to re-learn. Alternatively, if you come to FIFA just for Volta – because it’s the most accessible FIFA we have ever made and you don’t need to follow a club or understand the rules – you can pick it up and play it easily. Also, if these consumers do want to transition to 11-v-11, hopefully we can get them into the world of football, because the world needs more football fans</p>

  <p><b>[According to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20’s creative director Matt Prior, the addition of street football was one of the most-asked-for features from those who play the game]</b> Almost all of our consumers never have their first kick of a football in an 11v11 game. The roots of football start in the backyard, down at the park. It’s a part of football we haven’t previously had in the game, so we’re super excited to bring that aspect to FIFA</p>
