  <p><b>[Wigan Athletic Set To Seal €6 Million Deal For Espanyol Star Javi Marquez]</b> I am happy at Espanyol, but I am pleased by this news because today <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is, with Spain, the best in the world. But I insist that my first option is to continue with Espanyol</p>

  <p><b>[Espanyol Midfielder Javi Marquez Focusing On <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> Challenge; Remains Quiet On Transfer Speculation]</b> I will not say anything on this issue, and I will not convey a position on anything. I want spend a lot of time at Espanyol, this I have always said. I will not talk about anything else other than <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>. The team is currently enjoying a good feeling and we hope to capture that at the <a href="valencia-fc.html">Mestalla</a>. We want to leave the game with three points, that would leave us very high in the rankings.</p>

  <p><b>[Beating <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> Means More Than Just Three Points]</b> These matches are special because they are against a different rival. Winning against Madrid is worth more than three points. They play great football and will come out for victory.<br /><br />I do not know whether they will be under pressure in the league, there are still many matches to go, but we are looking after our own interests<br /><br />They have a large staff of players and can rotate smoothly. They will play the team that they see fit for this match, and we will do our best to keep the three points at home.<br /><br />We have a philosophy and we will die with it. We will show our strengths and we will try to beat them</p>

He’s also a great player and person. For me, this is an anecdote. If the name is accompanied by a great footballer, even better!</p>

  <p><b>[on his new contract]</b> I am very happy to join the New York Cosmos. I’ve play my whole career in Spain and joining a historic club in the NASL will definitely help me switch gears and stay competitive.
