  <p><b>[Herbie Kane has been making a big impression on loan at Doncaster Rovers]</b> Yeah, it has been <b>[perfect]</b>. When I first came, the aim was to get in the team and play as many games as I could. And I always want to contribute with goals and assists, so I’m glad I’m able to do that. The manager <b>[Grant McCann]</b> has trusted me to play pretty much every game, so I couldn’t really ask for more. It’s a tough league and he has lots of experience. And with him being a former midfielder, it helps me a lot<br /><br /><b>[Kane was born and raised in Bristol, but grew up idolising Gerrard]</b> I always looked at midfielders and Stevie was the one. I played more as a sitting midfielder. But I’ve always been more of a box-to-box midfielder. I’ve always been a midfielder who looks to get goals.<br /><br />I don’t set targets. But I’ve got the number 15 in my head now. Why not, eh? The good thing is I can feel the improvement. The area I knew I’d need to improve was the competitive side, things like second balls and battling in the midfield. It definitely helps that I’m coming up against different styles every week. Some teams play football and challenge you that way, others go a bit longer and you have to adjust and deal with that. It’s good for my development as a player, because you’re always gaining experience and learning. I can feel I’m improving in those areas<br /><br />The main thing I took away was how determined and hard-working everyone was. Yes, they’re great players, but it’s the mentality they have as well. They are all on it, every single day, they never let up. They’re so focused and driven, it stands out a mile. It’s so competitive, but it’s great just to be involved in those sessions and to see these players and how they work<br /><br />I don’t make any secret. I want to catch the Liverpool manager’s eye. I want to leave a footprint with this loan spell and give him something to think about come the summer. I want to be in his eyeline, maybe try to get on the pre-season tour, get an opportunity there and see what I can do. Every journey is different. It may be that I need to get 50 or 100 league games under my belt first and then we see from there, or things may change. You never know in football. There are some people who get the opportunity and take it, and that’s great. Trent has done that and that’s a big inspiration for everyone. But for others it’s about going out, playing games, experiencing league football and seeing how you develop there. That was the point of this loan spell, and I’m happy with how it’s gone so far. Palace will be a huge challenge but we’re confident, and for me it will be good to test myself against these players. I don’t mind saying it, the Premier League is where I want to play my football in the future</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Herbie Kane joins Hull for the season]</b> I’m looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead with <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a>. I’ve been excited ever since I heard the news that the club wanted to bring me in on loan. It was nice to come in this morning and meet the lads and it’s great to be linking up with the gaffer again. It’s nice that he has the trust in me to bring me here. Going forward, hopefully I can play some games and help the team get to where it wants to be come the end of the season</p>
