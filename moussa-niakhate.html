<blockquote>
  <p>[Mainz star Moussa Niakhate has hailed Paris Saint-Germain’s Thiago Silva as the best defender in the world] Even if we ask defenders to score goals, to be decisive more and more, the most important thing is to defend well. And for me, the one who defends best is Thiago Silva. In one against one, defensively, he is monstrous.<br /><br />I am a football lover - I watch a lot of football on TV. But I will not replay moments to see how he does things. I save the replays for my own matches. I watch the games as a spectator even though I have a closer look at the top players. Whether it’s Thiago Silva in France, the defenders of Juventus in Italy, Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool or Cesar Azpilicueta at Chelsea, I look at all the players, I am inspired by everything, but I focus on myself first<br /><br />[French players have a terrific reputation in the Bundesliga] They consider the French young players as diamonds. Whenever a Frenchman arrives, there is very little chance that he will be a flop. That’s what people here told me, and I think the World Cup win accentuated that. And if you look closely, there are many young players in the France squad: Ousmane Dembele, Kylian Mbappe, Florian Thauvin, Samuel Umtiti, Paul Pogba - for the most part, they still played with the youth teams not so long ago<br /><br />[On Abdou Diallo] We only spoke after I signed my deal. I wanted to make the decision for myself. He said that the stadiums are incredible, that there are shows everywhere and that people live for football. I knew it already, but it confirmed what I thought. He also told me about the club. He explained to me the rules of life. He told me that people were very reliable there. All we said was more like advice from friends. He gave me some tips. We talked about our life. But we did not go further on Mainz</p>
