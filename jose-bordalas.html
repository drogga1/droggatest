I would like to have had him here with us, he would have been a very good addition. Players go where they want to be. Brahim is at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Having made his intention clear, we have to respect him</p>

  <p>Whoever labels us anti-football doesn’t know what they’re talking about. <b>[We]</b> press in their half, play direct, look for goal as much as possible, and get into the box with as many players as possible. This is modern football and <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> is one of the teams that is best at modern football. There’s a lot of ways to play, all valid and attractive. They want to pin coaches to styles, but our responsibility is to mould the squad we have<br /><br /><b>[Jose Bordalas and <a href="quique-setien.html">Quique Setien</a> didn’t shake hands the next time they met]</b> <b>[I]</b> didn’t call to congratulate him on his appointment at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We don’t have that kind of relationship.
