  <p><b>[Zenit star Leandro Paredes denies deliberate red card amid Copa Libertadores final claims]</b> I was going to arrive on Sunday in Argentina, but as we played on Thursday for the Europa League in France, they proposed that I not return to Russia and travel directly from there on Friday. It’s all a lie. Nothing happened here. It’s something that was invented in Argentina. I didn’t earn red card on purpose, I would never do something like that. When I heard that this was being talked about, I talked with Zenit sporting director and he told me that they trust me.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>’s Leandro Paredes has voiced his belief that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> target <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> will remain with the French champions]</b> We talk a lot, he calls me all the time. I’m calm, he’ll stay with us<br /><br /><b>[Paredes was also asked to name who he thinks is the best midfielder in the world]</b> I think it’s <a href="marco-verratti.html">Verratti</a>. It’s impossible to take the ball off him and he’s very aggressive<br /><br />I think we’re changing the mentality of the club, as we saw in the second leg against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. The mentality is different in the league than in the Champions League. In Europe, you cannot relax for a single second, while the level of <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> can allow you to do that. The superior quality of our players means that we can always win in the end. If we change our mentality in the Champions League with the same players, the same team, the will to win will make us victorious</p>
