  <p><b>[San Jose Earthquakes have landed Costa Rican national team forward Marcos Urena using targeted allocation money]</b> We don’t just look at a player’s merits or international appearances. We focus more on the player’s skill set to understand whether or not they match what the team needs. Marcos is a very attack-minded player that will be a very important element in binding our midfield and attack. He has great technique and can make many key passes while covering a lot of ground. I think he’s going to be an exciting player for us.</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have used targeted allocation money to sign Dutch forward Danny Hoesen and German defender-midfielder Florian Jungwirth]</b> Danny Hoesen gives us a player with a strong frame that is tall, but also has a fast pace. He can attack the space in counterattack situations. He can also work in tandem with whichever striker will be supporting him. He’s a player that comes from very attack-minded football in Holland and will be the perfect striker to give us an additional element in the box that we may have been missing.<br /><br />Florian is capable of playing all defensive positions. He grew up as a central defender, on both the right and the left. He was later moved to defensive midfield because he is a player that has a strong presence and is very logical and careful when it comes to possession and buildup situations. He is a player that has a lot of heart and has been very much liked on every team that he’s played for because he will fight for his teammates and is a natural leader</p>

  <p><b>[San Jose Earthquakes sign Georgian playmaker Valeri Qazaishvili as designated player]</b> We were looking for a player, a younger, offensive player, that really excites the fans and has the possibility to stay with us for a long period of time. That’s what we found with Vako. We wanted a player that knows how to take on a defender one-on-one, that sees the goal and that also wants to bring a spark to our game.</p>

  <p><b>[San Jose Earthquakes part ways with Dominic Kinnear]</b> First and foremost, we would like to thank Dominic for his hard work, professionalism and contributions to this club over the years. He worked hard this year and was a first-class person all the way. This decision was made after a lot of thought and evaluation. We decided that we wanted to go in a different direction as we continue to build the identity of this club.</p>

  <p><b>[San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Matheus Silva came out of a coma late Thursday morning and is now able to speak]</b> We are incredibly excited and relieved to announce that Matheus Silva has awoken from his coma and is fully responsive. The entire Earthquakes organization is grateful for the invaluable effort by the doctors, players and staff at Reno 1868 FC and bystanders on the beach that contributed to Matheus being alive and well today.</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have hired Mikael Stahre as the club’s new head coach]</b> After a thorough evaluation process, we are excited that Mikael will be joining our club. What stood out with Mikael are not only the cups his teams won and his consistency over the past 10+ seasons, but also his ability to identify with our players, our coaching staff and most importantly our goals.</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have signed Swedish Allsvenskan top scorer Magnus Eriksson as a designated player]</b> With Magnus, we have identified an impact player that embodies the attitude we want to represent in San Jose and the technical qualities of a leading goal-scorer in Europe. His ability to play multiple roles in the attack and his work ethic defensively were major factors in our decision to pursue him. He is in great form, having led Sweden’s top league in scoring last season, and is an elite attacking player that has maintained a high level of consistency over the last five years</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have announced the signing of Uruguayan defender Yeferson Quintana on a season-long loan]</b> Yeferson fits the profile of the player we wanted to add at this position. His arrival will also give us different options as to how our defense will line up next season. Yeferson has a strong presence in both phases of the game, which makes him an important addition to our defensive line.</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have hired former Chivas Guadalajara boss Matias Almeyda]</b> What we saw in Matias was a coach that brought success by creating a culture we strive to emulate. He has demonstrated leadership qualities in Argentina with River Plate and Banfield, as well as in Mexico with Chivas. He has always had a winning mentality, both as a player and a coach, and most importantly, he is someone that knows how to redirect a team in a difficult situation with a commitment to a distinct style of play and youth development.</p>
