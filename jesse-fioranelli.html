  <p>[San Jose Earthquakes have landed Costa Rican national team forward Marcos Urena using targeted allocation money] We don’t just look at a player’s merits or international appearances. We focus more on the player’s skill set to understand whether or not they match what the team needs. Marcos is a very attack-minded player that will be a very important element in binding our midfield and attack. He has great technique and can make many key passes while covering a lot of ground. I think he’s going to be an exciting player for us.</p>

  <p>[The San Jose Earthquakes have announced the signing of Uruguayan defender Yeferson Quintana on a season-long loan] Yeferson fits the profile of the player we wanted to add at this position. His arrival will also give us different options as to how our defense will line up next season. Yeferson has a strong presence in both phases of the game, which makes him an important addition to our defensive line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The San Jose Earthquakes have hired former Chivas Guadalajara boss Matias Almeyda] What we saw in Matias was a coach that brought success by creating a culture we strive to emulate. He has demonstrated leadership qualities in Argentina with River Plate and Banfield, as well as in Mexico with Chivas. He has always had a winning mentality, both as a player and a coach, and most importantly, he is someone that knows how to redirect a team in a difficult situation with a commitment to a distinct style of play and youth development.</p>
