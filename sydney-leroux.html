  <p><b>[Sydney Leroux on her mom]</b> I don’t even think tomboy’s the word - I was a boy. One day we were going to the zoo, and I shaved my legs and put nail polish on - that was the day I decided I wanted to be a girl! My mom was like, ‘What!?’ But I knew that I alwayswanted tattoos. So I made this bet with her: if I score ten goals at nationals, can I get a tattoo? My mum goes, ‘Of course, it’s only four games.’ I ended up scoring 13 goals at nationals, so she had to take me. But she said, ‘It’s got to be something you love’. I said, ‘I love soccer’, so she said, ‘Get a soccer ball’. So I got a soccer ball, in flames, on my back! It was terrible! But at the same time I thought it was so cool, because I was 14 and I had a tattoo. I don’t know another parent who would go through with that bet!</p>
