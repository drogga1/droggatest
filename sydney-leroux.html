  <p><b>[Sydney Leroux on her mom]</b> I don’t even think tomboy’s the word - I was a boy. One day we were going to the zoo, and I shaved my legs and put nail polish on - that was the day I decided I wanted to be a girl! My mom was like, ‘What!?’ But I knew that I alwayswanted tattoos. So I made this bet with her: if I score ten goals at nationals, can I get a tattoo? My mum goes, ‘Of course, it’s only four games.’ I ended up scoring 13 goals at nationals, so she had to take me. But she said, ‘It’s got to be something you love’. I said, ‘I love soccer’, so she said, ‘Get a soccer ball’. So I got a soccer ball, in flames, on my back! It was terrible! But at the same time I thought it was so cool, because I was 14 and I had a tattoo. I don’t know another parent who would go through with that bet!</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney Leroux back on the field in NWSL after birth of first child]</b> That was a dream come true, to have a baby and be able to come back and play. It’s amazing that women can do what we do.<br /><br />I can say that was a lot of running today. But every single day I feel better. I’m not 100 percent yet, but I’m getting there and I’m happy with my progress<br /><br />It’s fun to watch because I’ve known Syd for a really long time and I know having a baby is really tough on the body, but she’s taking it all in stride<br /><br />I think when I’m mentally and physically ready I’ll come back in. But I’m getting there, so I’m excited for that as well</p>

  <p><b>[Explaining her decision to join the protest, Leroux said she wanted to set an example for her one-year-old son, Cassius]</b> I have a baby and I want him to look up to me and be proud of who I am and what I stand for. I think that speaks volumes to have other people who aren’t necessarily women of color to come and say, ‘No, something needs to change.’ I’m so honored to play with people like that. I remember someone saying something about Pinoe when she knelt about, ‘Oh, well you did it in front of 23 people in comparison to the NFL players doing it in front of thousands and on TV’. And I think that what’s important is, for me in my heart, that’s the right thing to do..</p>
