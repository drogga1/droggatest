  <p><b>[Leckie thrilled to join ‘fantastic club’ <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>]</b> I had a few offers. <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> stood out for various reasons. <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> is a big, fantastic <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club. They’ve been very successful over the last two seasons. Now they’re playing in the Europa League. Additionally, Berlin is great; one of the nicest cities in Germany. I also think that <a href="pal-dardai.html">Pal Dardai</a> is a great coach, who I can learn a lot from<br /><br />Last winter it was reported in the newspaper that I was a potential candidate for <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a>. That was the first time I heard the rumour. My agent then got in touch with the club, but at this point I was solely focussing on Ingolstadt. Then towards the end of the season, particularly in the last two weeks, the talks intensified. I met with <a href="michael-preetz.html">Michael Preetz</a> and <a href="pal-dardai.html">Pal Dardai</a> for the first time last Monday. We talked extensively and I was pleased because I realised that the club really was interested in me</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>’s Leckie captained Australia in the absence of injured skipper Mark Milligan]</b> It is always tough qualification in Asia, especially away games. We had a good training camp <b>[and]</b> we were fortunate that we only had one game this camp, so we had a good week to prepare. The boys showed a good mentality today, a lot of concentration, those are the things you need playing in these conditions. It is very warm, so I think it comes down to the mental game, 3-0 away, it is never easy, but we got the job done</p>
