<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brooklyn-born Justin Haak, who signed as a homegrown with the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> club in January of this year, is extremely excited to see]</b> My experiences were just like playing in the park with my friends. We would get a small group together and there’s a park close to my house but there’s not really any soccer specific areas so we would play on the basketball court. Now, these soccer fields are in easy locations for young kids, after school or on the weekend they can just come by, play in a safe area and have fun<br /><br />I first met Claudio when I was like 12 years old, going to the NYCFC training centres before they started. He played a little bit before I started watching soccer, but I knew about everything he’d done and what he’d accomplished. Since then, we’ve become much closer and have just developed a good relationship<br /><br /><b>[It’s thanks to the work of NYCFC that players like Haak can continue to develop]</b> Everyone is just a lot more aware of the sport. It’s really important to me that other kids that are growing up similarly to how I grew up can have the opportunity to play soccer at a high level, too.</p>
