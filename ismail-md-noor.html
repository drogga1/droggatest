  <p><b>[Ismail Md Noor, has said that despite the large sum profited from the sale of Mohammed Ghaddar to JDT, they are still unable to clear the overdue salary payments of players from their 2015 and 2016 seasons]</b> This does not mean that we are sitting quietly. We are working to find the money to clear these overdue salaries. It’s just that at the moment, we do not have that kind of money. We are constantly committed to resolve this issue. When the time comes, we will play.<br /><br />KAFA has two choices. Either let Kelantan be the bashing boys or continue to stay competitive throughout the rest of this campaing. So, according to current situation it means that we need to sort the more important <b>[current salaries]</b> ones first. As for the accrued salaries, there are other methods to pay. If we are only to focus on these overdue salaries, I think Kelantan can pull out of the M-League because the players that we have now will run away because we can’t pay them</p>
