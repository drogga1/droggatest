  <p><b>[The best right-back in the world? How <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is reinventing the full-back]</b> He’s got that element of surprise to his attacks. He chooses the perfect moment. Not just any footballer has that innate sense. If you’ve got a team that’s constantly on the attack, like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, then it looks like <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> is, too - but he is much cleverer than that. He takes risks and loses the ball quite a lot, whether with crosses into the box or long diagonal balls, but that doesn’t matter because the disorganisation it creates causes havoc<br /><br />That game just isn’t normal for a full-back<br /><br /><b>[In April’s Champions League semi-final second leg, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> back level on aggregate after a 3-0 battering in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he spotted <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> all alone in the penalty area as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>’s defenders chatted among themselves. <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> delivered instantly in a moment of unique improvisation]</b> It comes down to making a quick decision and having the skill to execute it. Something like that will happen only once, so to have the confidence to make that choice in a Champions League semi-final is the most impressive thing.<br /><br /><b>[High-intensity sprint training has now become the norm]</b> It’s no use just being able to run at the same pace and get around a pitch like a midfielder might have done 10 years ago - it has to be more precise<br /><br />Full-backs are pure athletes, almost 1,500m runners now, and they have to be the fittest in the team. He’s the perfect player for this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side: young, quick and fundamental for the champions-elect. He has the chance to define an era with his team.</p>
