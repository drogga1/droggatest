  <p><b>[Legend Cabrini Crucifies Ungrateful Juve]</b> In February I left my post as coach of Syria because I could not work in complete disorganization. I had some promises in Italy but in truth I am now out of the Calcio lobby. I don’t have friends who are agents. I have always avoided compromises. Of those from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, only <b>[Roberto]</b> Bettega, has proved to be a true friend. The rest of the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are silent. They wanted former champions yet they have got rid of Marco Tardelli also. Look at Milan. <a href="silvio-berlusconi.html">Berlusconi</a> will always find a place for former players. I gave 13 years of my career to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s shirt, I even agreed to play when I was injured. One can see that the gratitude in Turin does not exist</p>

  <p><b>[One <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> great remembers another as Antonio Cabrini pays tribute to the legendary Gaetano Scirea]</b> Gaetano Scirea is still in my heart. I will not talk about Scirea the player as everyone knows him, and the great class he had. I want to remember Scirea the man. An excellent person. I have never met a person with the humanity that Scirea had. Men like Scirea no longer exist. He was always ready to give you a hand, not only on the pitch. It’s not true that he would never get angry. He made himself heard on the pitch, just that he was never exaggerated like the others. He used to tell people what was needed, but with more tranquility. He was a true gentleman in every way. Gaetano was a true friend</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender Antonio Cabrini feels <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is a better player than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> because the Portugal star has proven to be a real leader both on and off the pitch]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is probably the best player in the world. Obviously the focus in football over the last 10 years has been on the rivalry between <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. My personal opinion is that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is better than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but mainly in terms of leadership. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has proven himself to be a real leader on a lot of occasions and not just on the pitch. He is a leader in his life as well as in sports. So with all due respect to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, there have been a few instances in his career that he came up short. That being said, we are speaking about two great players, I think we can all agree on that.<br /><br />Whether it’s the transfer market or commercial activities, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> always plan ahead. That’s the reason they are ahead of their rivals. When the other Italian teams start their transfer activity, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have already completed the two or three key men they wanted to in that window. Another example is that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are the first big team in Italy to own its own stadium. They all speak about it but nobody else has started to build their own home</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus legend Antonio Cabrini has warned <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> that playing in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> will be nothing like his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> days]</b> Generally speaking, it’s been difficult for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players to come to Italy.<br /><br />The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>’s an amazing league, very entertaining, a lot of intensity… But a lot of teams can ignore the tactical side of the game a little bit because they prefer the entertaining physical games. Sometimes players are not on the same tactical level when they move to another league.<br /><br />In the last few years, the level of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has risen a lot, though. <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players are in a better position to deal with other styles of play. The league has not just grown when it comes to intensity and physicality, but also tactically. I am actually proud that a small part of this has been down to Italian coaches making an impact in England.<br /><br />There are three things a player needs to realise in order to succeed at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. The first two are the same at every club. First of all, you need to be hungry. Secondly, no matter what kind of player you are, it is all about winning. So long as you win, the fans love you.<br /><br />Finally, and this is quite specific to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, when you are leaving the club, you leave shaking the hands of the manager and chairman and that’s it.This isn’t like other clubs, where everybody is crying and devastated when a key player leaves. At <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, the club always comes first</p>
