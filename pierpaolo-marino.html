  <p><b>[Dries Mertens has a €28 million release in his new Napoli contract and remains the subject of interest from Manchester United]</b> Manchester United are following Mertens very closely. He was an underestimated player until he played as a striker, now that he is a ‘real No.9’ he is kept under the eye of big clubs, because the €28 million clause a a low price, even if he’s 30 years old.<br /><br />This could be the year of the Blues. But not because Juve are weaker, but because Napoli have improved</p>

  <p><b>[On Leonardo Bonucci]</b> I think Milan already regret buying Bonucci. I think that if Massimiliano Mirabelli and Marco Fassone could go back in time, they’d spend that money on a top striker instead.</p>

  <p><b>[Udinese chief Marino says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> will cancel rest of season]</b> The Belgian Federation has already sanctioned the end of their league, despite the threats of sanctions from <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>. In England, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is about to release a similar statement, because the situation there is becoming very, very serious. I frankly just hope we can enjoy football again after the coronavirus. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, we need to get out of this danger zone. I am worried for the next seasons, not the old one</p>
