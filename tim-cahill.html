My behaviour also hurt the game so I also apologise to my team, to Melbourne Victory and to all the fans at the game and watching at home. Regardless of whatever happens on the pitch, I have to respect the game and the officials. I want the game to grow in Australia and I want to do all I can to help that happen. No matter the situation, I have to set an example and be accountable for my words and actions</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City’s Tim Cahill has questioned whether Sydney FC’s tactics will work in the A-League finals]</b> There’s no shadow of a doubt and when we lose attacking, and we know we’ve kept the ball and played well, at least when we watch the video we can work on things.<br /><br />When you’re playing Sydney FC, you know they’re going to come here and defend. They’re very unlikely to come out and attack because they know we have a lot going forward but they’ve based themselves on a manager that makes sure they’re well-drilled. You see the way they play, all the midfield fuses back in. They wait and prey and there’s 11 behind the ball 24/7, and I suppose you have to really respect that because that’s the reason why they’re at the top but at the same time, questions will be asked when it’s about winning games at the right times. For us, we need to finish as high as possible but come finals time that’s when everyone needs to be firing</p>

  <p><b>[On himself]</b> I feel like I’ve ticked some boxes but I also feel there’s a lot to fulfil. I don’t see myself as a player who wants to finish any time soon <b>[…]</b> The time comes when you want it to finish. It has to be a motivational thing - I play because I’m passionate and I love the game. My passion outweighs anyone’s, in my opinion. I’m still running, chasing down defenders - not just going through the motions. I feel like I’ve ticked some boxes but I also feel there’s a lot to fulfil. I don’t see myself as a player who wants to finish any time soon, or doesn’t have the appetite. When I looked <b>[at the data from his last game for City]</b>, I ran 7km in 55 mins, but I’m also asking, could I have got on the end of more crosses, created more, converted more?<br /><br /><b>[Cahill has also lent his experience to national team bolter Riley McGree]</b> We don’t know if this will be our first camp or our last, any of us, you have to leave asking if you’ve given everything. Riley’s ability is exceptional - he has amazing feet, he’s good on the ball, confident and very forward-thinking</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill has indicated the Socceroos and coach Ange Postecoglou produce their best when critics write them off]</b> Six months before when they said we were going to struggle and we wouldn’t even come out of our group, and Ange said that <b>[captain]</b> Mile <b>[Jedinak]</b> would lift the cup and that was a year prior and in the end I was standing on the side thinking about that moment and saying ‘it’s time to kick on again’ and we have kicked on again.<br /><br />Unfortunately the result against Thailand <b>[a 2-2 draw in November]</b> wasn’t the best one and now it’s about the last three games. So I’m always confident because it’s just business. It’s all about points and it’s also about playing a great style of football</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill speaks about Australia head coach <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Ange Postecoglou</a>’s philosophy and positive influence]</b> It’s all about points and playing a great style of football. I’ve been around for three World Cups and going to my fourth World Cup qualifying campaign. I can see the style in what he’s trying to do and I think the main thing is, whatever style you put, every style ends up becoming a 4-4-2, whether you like it or not, or a 4-3-3. We’re all professional players that play in big leagues around the world and it takes time. Ange’s thoughts are still, as well as the older and younger players, is you want to go to a World Cup and make an impact. Not just stumble in or Confederations Cup and hope for the best when you get there and play it by ear</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill pays tribute to Australia’s legendary football broadcaster Les Murray, who passed away on 31 July aged 71]</b> Devastated to lose someone that’s so special to our game, Les Murray. As a kid I watched him on TV and woke up early hours of the morning to watch his broadcasts of World Cups and followed him on and off our TV screens as I grew older. He is the voice of football and someone that has always supported the game and myself as a footballer. His legacy will live on forever and I just want to say ‘Thank you Les’ for helping our game to grow through the good times and the tough times. Rest in Peace Legend</p>

I feel like a young kid. I know I’m 38 next month, but it’s my job to put my body on the line for this team. We wanted to show what we stand for - not just for the last two-and-a-half years of qualifying, but for the past four years. I would’ve done anything to be part of this group and I will do anything to stay a part of it. I am indebted to this country for allowing me to follow my dreams and do what I love</p>

I’m still taking it in now. The first thing I wanted to do when with <b>[manager Neil Harris]</b> was to walk on the pitch and in the tunnel and have that feeling again that brings back so many memories. Once you go over that white line, you get a nervous sensation back that I had when I was a 16-year-old when I first signed here.</p>

And hopefully, touching wood, no injuries.<br /><br /><b>[Cahill’s quotes are a far cry from his initial reasoning for leaving Australia]</b> I need game time … If I don’t <b>[get it at Melbourne City]</b>, I’ll find a way to play. To get to a World Cup you need to be playing at the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[Everton have lost their identity]</b> It’s confusing and I think <b>[the fans]</b> are confused too. I feel we’ve lost our identity as a club. I feel like there’s nothing that we’re really stamping and building around. Now it seems that we’re just making signings and the chemistry is not there. It’s difficult to watch if I’m honest because of the quality.<br /><br />You want a big owner with money. OK, we’ve got that, but that doesn’t always bring you success overnight. But I know the fans want some passion, they want an identity. When you look back to Roberto Martinez’s style of football maybe the Everton fans were impatient. Under David Moyes maybe they thought it was getting stale. But now you can appreciate what you’ve lost</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta has earned the right to be considered for the Arsenal job]</b> I think the best thing for him is that he’s out there learning his trade, he is out there putting in the hours that count. He’s taking it so seriously within himself, he’s got great pride and understanding of the game; the tactics and the knowledge. Who he is working for and working with now is probably one of the strongest set-ups in the world and probably one of the best managers in the world. So when you talk about someone like Mikel coming into a club like Arsenal who he’s already been a part of, already knows the background, already knows what it’s all about - including Thierry <b>[Henry]</b> in this as well - he’s not someone you would not put in the frame. Let’s put experience and all of this away, no one is saying he is going to be the number one or number two but they can build something special with their ex players that love the club. Maybe get someone with experience next to them. The piece of the puzzle comes with what the group of coaching staff is going to be and that’s the secret for most successful managers around the world, what Pep has built or Jose Mourinho - those sorts of managers. Can he do it? I’ll never say he can’t do it. If the opportunity arises then it’s definitely something for him as an individual to look at because he’s earned that right.</p>

You know when you become a passenger, when you can’t keep up. The last seven days have shown if you can’t make an impact in this group of 26 then you’re not meant to be here. Right now for me I feel relaxed, mentally driven, I’ve got a selfish program - all I’m doing is looking after your body. I spend 24 hours a day preparing for a 90 minute-2 hour session. That’s awesome for us</p>
