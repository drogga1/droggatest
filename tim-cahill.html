  <p><b>[Tim Cahill speaks after scoring the winning goal for Melbourne City in a 1-0 victory against Sydney FC to lift the club’s first ever trophy, the <a href="ffa.html">FFA</a> Cup]</b> Collectively as a group I said to the boys before we went out, you don’t get a lot of chances like this in your career. For one night only we will play out heart and souls out and give it everything, and when you are cooked put your hand up…I wanted to get the fire out of their bellies</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill speaks about Australia head coach <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Ange Postecoglou</a>’s philosophy and positive influence]</b> It’s all about points and playing a great style of football. I’ve been around for three World Cups and going to my fourth World Cup qualifying campaign. I can see the style in what he’s trying to do and I think the main thing is, whatever style you put, every style ends up becoming a 4-4-2, whether you like it or not, or a 4-3-3. We’re all professional players that play in big leagues around the world and it takes time. Ange’s thoughts are still, as well as the older and younger players, is you want to go to a World Cup and make an impact. Not just stumble in or Confederations Cup and hope for the best when you get there and play it by ear</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill pays tribute to Australia’s legendary football broadcaster Les Murray, who passed away on 31 July aged 71]</b> Devastated to lose someone that’s so special to our game, Les Murray. As a kid I watched him on TV and woke up early hours of the morning to watch his broadcasts of World Cups and followed him on and off our TV screens as I grew older. He is the voice of football and someone that has always supported the game and myself as a footballer. His legacy will live on forever and I just want to say ‘Thank you Les’ for helping our game to grow through the good times and the tough times. Rest in Peace Legend</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Cahill speaks after the Socceroos booked their ticket to Russia 2018 , defeating Honduras 3-1 on aggregate in their intercontinental play-off]</b> To help my country qualify for four World Cups is something I will be proud of when I get older … even older. I feel like a young kid. I know I’m 38 next month, but it’s my job to put my body on the line for this team. We wanted to show what we stand for - not just for the last two-and-a-half years of qualifying, but for the past four years. I would’ve done anything to be part of this group and I will do anything to stay a part of it. I am indebted to this country for allowing me to follow my dreams and do what I love</p>

  <p><b>[Australian striker Tim Cahill is ready to join an elite group at Russia by becoming just the fourth player in history to score at four World Cups]</b> You can’t at my age, be a passenger. You know when you become a passenger, when you can’t keep up. The last seven days have shown if you can’t make an impact in this group of 26 then you’re not meant to be here. Right now for me I feel relaxed, mentally driven, I’ve got a selfish program - all I’m doing is looking after your body. I spend 24 hours a day preparing for a 90 minute-2 hour session. That’s awesome for us</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> star Tim Cahill has said he believes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> is the most exciting young player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I like the look of <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>. I think he’s a top goalscorer and he’s got a massive career ahead of him. One of the reasons why I like him a lot is because of his coach <b>[<a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> and the way that he’s trying to mould a player similar to himself. He can lead him and show him the right ways. You can see that starting to come to fruition with his football this season. I’m a big fan.<br /><br /><a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> is a great manager but unfortunately he had some difficult times. I think he needed to be more open and embrace the fans a little more. Results weren’t going his way, but you can see the personality of <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>, the aura and the respect that he carries. He’s won the fans over, which is really important because they’re a big part of the football club. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> will certainly improve and I’m looking forward to seeing where he can take the club</p>
