  <p><b>[Argentina’s interim coach Lionel Scaloni has admitted that he does not know when or if Lionel Messi will return to international football]</b> I know you are all waiting for me to talk about him, so that is the only specific issue I will cover: we had a chat, after which we decided he would not be there. It would be very unwise of me to tell Leo to stay at home and not come. There is no coach in the world who would benefit from Leo not being available. We did not talk about his future. He will not be in this call-up and we will see what happens in the next ones.<br /><br />No player has dropped out of this squad. I spoke to several and all of them said they were available. All the decisions made were for the good of the national team and to see what we can contribute in the future. We understand that right now we need these footballers, who have enormous potential. Recently there has been some talk over whether some players could wear the shirt, now is the time for them to prove themselves</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina coach Scaloni sees downside to Barcelona superstar Messi]</b> The shadow of him which hangs over the pitch might be too much for some of the youngsters. We are always asking about him. In the matches he’s played for the national team, it’s very rare that he hasn’t given his all. The best thing we can do is ask for everyone else to perform as they do for their clubs<br /><br />We need to take advantage of the fact he’s on the pitch with us. He’s the greatest player of all time but on the pitch he needs to be just another person who helps us win. We need him on the ball. What we need to do if he drops deep is another player goes into his position in attack. Leo is a forward, creates assists and the closer he is to the goal the better<br /><br />I do not think it’s true that the best are there, in Europe. What is evident is that, on an economic level, the best players of 18 or 20 years of age are at the best clubs in the world. The best thing for us would be that most clubs can keep top talents in Argentine football for another year, so we can enjoy them a little more and the player would go to Europe being a more complete player. Most of the guys who leave for Europe see themselves as one for the future, as promising, and we never see it where they go to Europe already being a phenomenon</p>

Some were left out due to injury, but they were always in consideration. When you have so many players of a good level to choose from, there are always doubts. It is difficult to explain everything, but the final decision is always about what is best for the team. We suffer when we have to leave a player out. It’s our job, but it’s not easy for us. We want people to identify with all these guys. We are convinced that they are the best for the moment. We are clear about what we want and we know what our idea is.<br /><br /><b>[Argentina will play Colombia, Paraguay and Qatar in the group stage]</b> Colombia is one of the most powerful teams in South America; they have great players.

I do not have ‘the’ formula. I think about what I would do if I were <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s partner, as I once was. In the day-to-day, in the locker room, you have to approach Leo and start by taking him as a normal person. I am convinced that everything starts there. Because the issue is not just on the <b>[pitch]</b>. This is much deeper. It is necessary that the players come to talk with Leo in the locker room, at breakfast… they have to realize that he is one of ours. If we get that, then everything will be easier on the <b>[pitch]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has played once under Scaloni, a 3-1 friendly defeat at home to Venezuela in March]</b> We lost that game and things did not go well. Afterwards, I had a very interesting talk with the players. They opened. It was very productive. It seems to me that there was a lot of progress. This is normal to happen. For many of these guys it’s a big step to be in the national team. And, on top of sharing it with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, much more. We already know that Leo has a special aura. Being by his side, watching him play, <b>[it’s]</b> not easy to assimilate. You have to let a few days go by. That’s why this time before the Copa America will be key to breaking that ice that I was talking about before. I think it’s going to happen naturally</h4>

We are lucky to be alive. We have to look more like the second half, but be more balanced and thus be able to manage the game.<br /><br />Our first half was not good, we played with desperation at times and we couldn’t control the play or create attacks. We had a very clear plan but couldn’t execute it as we kept losing the ball. They scored with their first attack and that caused us a lot of uncertainty. For a team like Argentina, which feels like it always has to win, the first blow is hard to take, but we assured the players at half time that it was just one goal<br /><br /><b>[Unhappy Martinez was substituted in the 67th minute with what was later described as a glute injury]</b> I don’t know if it was the best version <b>[before Martinez came off]</b>, but without a doubt it was the most dangerous.

Coach Lionel Scaloni beamed after the final whistle]</b> We showed without a doubt that this group of players feel the shirt like nobody else. Brazil were put under the cosh by Argentina at some points. It is the best game we played at this Copa because of the quality of the opponent and what we created. We played a complete game, but it was not good enough to go through. We felt we were superior but playing in the final was the key and we couldn’t do it</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina vs Chile.

I think my test has already passed. Bringing these players and making them play was my test, and I did it. What we came to do, we did. The match with Chile is important. We want to finish in the best way possible. Everyone is motivated.<br /><br />&gt; <b>[Midfield anchor <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> may not feature, but he doesn’t seem too enamoured with the prospect of third place anyway]</b> It’s a match in which the third place is fought for, which is not important, it’s just to fulfil it. If we look at it coldly, there is not much desire to play for third place. We have to rest and try to get the best out of this cup. I’m sad for the group, but we’re still more united than ever</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if it was the best showing of his tenure]</b> Possibly, yes, considering the opponent, but we had great games before, with our attitude. What stands out, aside from the performance, was the attitude of wanting to overcome the score and not give the match away. That was our team’s greatest virtue in the second half. It was a complicated match at 2-0, and it could’ve ended badly for us, but we read the match properly.<br /><br />What we were supposed to do in the first half didn’t happen. In the second half it did. We’ve matured lot, that’s what these matches are all about; growing for the future, with complicated things ahead. I think it <b>[the second half]</b> was the same as the first half, with the distinction that we didn’t commit any mistakes at ball clearances. We had four mistakes in the first period; two of them were goals, the other two weren’t.<br /><br />In these kinds of games, what matters is the functionality over the score. Logically, if we don’t lose, it’s better. The score comes second, most important is the performance. In the second half, I’ll say it again, we saw another Argentina, a more decisive Argentina that knew what to do. But the first half needs to be properly analysed. There were mistakes and if we could erase those mistakes, the performance wasn’t bad. Logically, Argentina were superior in the second half, so we must point out the good aspects and correct the bad ones from now on</p>
