They have been playing together for a long time, the coach has been <b>[in charge]</b> for a long time. That is an advantage for them.

The players have so much support for Leo that at times they say they want to be champions more for him than themselves. There’s no doubt the best player in the history of football is missing a trophy with the Argentina national team and it’s for that reason his team-mates say things like that</p>

We leave an image for the future of this national team and a very good way forward.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his future at the helm, Scaloni – in his first management job – said it was not the time to discuss his position]</b> I don’t think it’s time to talk about it, because that’s the least of my worries right now.

Brazil were put under the cosh by Argentina at some points. It is the best game we played at this Copa because of the quality of the opponent and what we created. We played a complete game, but it was not good enough to go through. We felt we were superior but playing in the final was the key and we couldn’t do it</p>

I think my test has already passed. Bringing these players and making them play was my test, and I did it. What we came to do, we did. The match with Chile is important. We want to finish in the best way possible. Everyone is motivated.<br /><br />&gt; <b>[Midfield anchor Vidal may not feature, but he doesn’t seem too enamoured with the prospect of third place anyway]</b> It’s a match in which the third place is fought for, which is not important, it’s just to fulfil it. If we look at it coldly, there is not much desire to play for third place. We have to rest and try to get the best out of this cup. I’m sad for the group, but we’re still more united than ever</p>

I feel that we should be playing the final right now, but we got the consolation prize of winning the third-place game, which is the least we had to do. We believe that when one of us is hit we all are, in a football sense. You cannot look away when a team-mate is mistreated. We saw it with Leo and with others too. We built a team through our unity<br /><br />The sensation from the game today is even stranger than the other day. I still don’t get the criteria for VAR in this Copa.

I’m sure it’s going to be a tough team for any national team to play. It’ll be complicated</p>

I’ve no doubts that they’ll be a very difficult opponent for any team in the world<br /><br /><b>[After a scoreless draw against Chile, the coach was again forced to defend his squad selection]</b> If we only thought about getting results, the panel would have been different. The result is important, but in these friendlies it should not come before everything else. We wanted to see several young players</p>

The line is very thin. To say that Argentina failed, it’s complicated. It seems that not leaving as champion is worthless. The line is very thin. I would not throw so much in the trash. Everyone who comes to the national team shows incredible self-love. They give everything for this shirt</p>

He will remain the best as long he wants, has the capacity and is physically able. He is magical, and he is a player who, while we can enjoy him, it would be great if everyone valued him, because there will be no one else like him<br /><br />He is suspended but he is part of the squad. Leo is delighted with his team-mates. We hope he brings joy to the people, which is the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[Messi thinks it was the right decision and backed the 41-year-old to be a success]</b> He’s a coach who has things clear in his head, who knows how to watch football and is very good at getting things across. He’s easy to understand, he’s good at his job and he knows how to handle the players. I think they got it right in giving him the job permanently and the space and time he needs to work with the national team</p>

They are good friends and more importantly the future of this shirt. Last Sunday’s game was very good and we hope they play well together. They <b>[Germany]</b> have great players that are out due to injury but we do as well and they are just as important as their players. It’s a challenge and many of them who will go out tomorrow will find out if they are capable of playing. I believe this is the last step in finalising our squad and seeing who we have</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if it was the best showing of his tenure]</b> Possibly, yes, considering the opponent, but we had great games before, with our attitude. What stands out, aside from the performance, was the attitude of wanting to overcome the score and not give the match away. That was our team’s greatest virtue in the second half. It was a complicated match at 2-0, and it could’ve ended badly for us, but we read the match properly.<br /><br />What we were supposed to do in the first half didn’t happen. In the second half it did. We’ve matured lot, that’s what these matches are all about; growing for the future, with complicated things ahead. I think it <b>[the second half]</b> was the same as the first half, with the distinction that we didn’t commit any mistakes at ball clearances. We had four mistakes in the first period; two of them were goals, the other two weren’t.<br /><br />In these kinds of games, what matters is the functionality over the score. Logically, if we don’t lose, it’s better. The score comes second, most important is the performance. In the second half, I’ll say it again, we saw another Argentina, a more decisive Argentina that knew what to do. But the first half needs to be properly analysed. There were mistakes and if we could erase those mistakes, the performance wasn’t bad. Logically, Argentina were superior in the second half, so we must point out the good aspects and correct the bad ones from now on</p>
