I’m the perfect guy to bring him back. I will never stray from the truth, that’s the truth. There’s nothing else to it.

You cannot represent yourself in the public eye like that and expect your child to respect what you do. You are an influence, you are a hero to your children, and you are a fool if you think they’re not going to follow in your footsteps.<br /><br /><b>[McGregor made a grovelling apology on ESPN last month after footage leaked of him punching an elderly patron of a Dublin pub who had refused a shot of his Proper No 12 whiskey]</b> I’m ready to fight. After I seen him punch an old guy … I got a human services major, I wanna do social work. Being here is just a circumstance of my life. I wanted to try fighting, I won 25 fights in a row and fought Eddie Alvarez on a pay-per-view. I wanted to be a social worker, so to see him treat people like that … Even before he takes a phone and smashes it on the ground, to see him walk around with his chest in the air. You do not represent yourself like that. I will never respect you</p>

But to put food on my table - I really don’t care about that. I will feel a little bit bad about that because I know how bad people want it. But for me to act like it would bother me, that would be a lie.
