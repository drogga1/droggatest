  <p><b>[Young Paris Saint-Germain attacker Jonathan Ikone says it is his desire to reach the heights attained by Franck Ribery]</b> He’s always an example. Just look at his career to understand why he’s someone to emulate. He’s got great rhythm. He can beat his marker so easily. He’s not a player who scores very often, but he always makes plenty of assists. That’s what I want to do. On the field, I try to do what he would do sometimes, but I’ve not got the same skills as him yet! Maybe it will come. I try to reproduce his sidesteps, but I also take the example of Riyad Mahrez or Neymar, who are also very technical. What I love to do is to beat players. So, when I’m in a one-against-one situation, I won’t hesitate.<br /><br />I have a dream that has not changed and still doesn’t budge: to win the Ballon d’Or. It’s still a long way off, so my next aim is to be a player for a team that plays in the Champions League. I’ve still not proven anything, so I can’t say I’m able to do it, but I hope and dream<br /><br />He’s made a tremendous leap compared to the little player I knew and played with at Bondy. He deserves to be first in the NxGn ranking. If it were up to me, I’d put him on top. He has improved his movement and in front of goal he does not joke. He is complete. At Bondy there are very good coaches. Kylian’s father, for example, trained me. He’s a very good coach who followed me until I left for PSG. I often go back to Bondy<br /><br />To score. I’m often reproached: ‘You think too much of making goals and not enough of scoring goals’. It’s true that I prefer to make assists. After that, I must use my right foot more and improve its quality. Finally, I must become more consistent, but everyone can say that</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> attacking midfielder Jonathan Ikone marked his international debut for France with a goal in a 4-1 Euro 2020 qualifier win over Albania, a moment that he described as a dream come true]</b> I said that my dream was to bring things to the team. Defensively first and why not offensively if everything goes well. A dream that has come true. Frankly, I’m really happy, I hope it’s going to continue. The integration <b>[with the squad]</b> went really well, there were players who talked to me, helped me settle in as quickly as possible, and the coach has made me feel at ease. It’s never easy because the opposing team has continued to fight</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Ikone says he has no regrets about his decision to leave <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> last summer, after he became France’s newest goalscorer]</b> We can say that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> train young players very well, but actually playing there is complicated. But the training you get in Paris, it’s the best. Really, I enjoyed my time at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. I have no regrets. Getting playing time there is difficult, there are really great players there. So, I decided to show my talent at another club</p>
