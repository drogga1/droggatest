<blockquote>
  <p>Japan has planned traditional pageantry and banquets to celebrate the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito in the world’s oldest hereditary monarchy, and invited the world to Tokyo for the festivities. The ceremony takes place Tuesday at the Imperial Palace, nearly six months after he inherited the Chrysanthemum Throne from his 85-year-old father, Akihito, who became the first emperor in two centuries to abdicate, citing health concerns<br /><br />Who is Naruhito? The oldest of the three children born to now-Emperor Emeritus Akihito and his wife, Empress Emerita Michiko. Naruhito, 59, graduated in 1982 with a history degree from Gakushuin University in Tokyo, a school favored by the Japanese imperial family, and then studied for two years at Oxford University. He married former diplomat Masako Owada in 1993 and they have one child, Princess Aiko, 17, who is barred by law from the throne because she is female. Princess Masako, as she was known, spent years largely out of the public eye after their marriage<br /><br />Naruhito will take his seat on the throne, and chamberlains will place the imperial regalia on a table. Masako will then be seated on her adjacent throne before speeches by the Emperor and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who will then lead three cheers<br /><br />Japan had been hoping to welcome Vice President Mike Pence, as a symbol of its most important diplomatic relationship, but the U.S. has opted to send a lower-ranked mission led by Transport Secretary Elaine Chao. Neighboring South Korea will send Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon despite the increasingly bitter feud that divides the Asian neighbors. Among the more controversial guests will be Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whose reputation is shadowed by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.<br /><br />About half a million petty criminals will also be pardoned to mark the enthronement, a plan that has met with some criticism<br /><br />In 2016, Akihito said he may no longer be physically fit enough to carry out his duties. The emperor’s powers were restricted after World War II, so Parliament had to pass a one-time law to allow for abdication<br /><br />April 30, 2019, marked the end of Akihito imperial era known as Heisei, which can be translated as ‘achieving peace’. The last emperor to abdicate was Kokaku, who stepped down in 1817 to make way for his son. The new imperial era has been dubbed Reiwa, which the government translated as ‘beautiful harmony’<br /><br />Japan’s Imperial Household Agency lists Emperor Jimmu, who according to legend was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, as the first to ascend the throne in 660 B.C. The verified historical record of Japan’s imperial family starts at about the sixth century and, according to the official genealogy, includes eight empresses who reigned, two of them twice. Naruhito is the 126th emperor, by the agency’s count.<br /><br />Naruhito’s grandfather, Hirohito, was the last emperor designated by tradition to be a living god. After Japan’s defeat in 1945, the U.S. kept Hirohito on the throne to build unity, but made the position of emperor one for a mortal who had no say in state policy<br /><br />‘The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People,’ the first chapter of Japan’s postwar constitution states. This means the emperor stays out of politics and spends a lot of time attending ceremonies<br /><br />After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed some 16,000 people, Akihito and Michiko visited survivors at shelters and were seen as helping a battered nation recover through their compassion<br /><br />Who’s next in line? That would be Emperor Naruhito’s younger brother, Prince Akishino. After him comes Akishino’s 13-year-old son, Hisahito</p>
