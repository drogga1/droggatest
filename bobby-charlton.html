  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I have never seen a man so capable of carrying the burden of following the Old Man (Sir Matt Busby). He has the strength and the powers of leadership and I know if he gets the job the club is in the best possible hands</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bobby Charlton’s Perfect XI]</b> He <b>[Cruyff]</b> was pretty intelligent, too! A real football brain. He had superb control, he was inventive and he could perform magic with a ball to get himself out of trouble instinctively. He got a lot of goals, and although he was so skilful, he didn’t show off - he played to the strengths of the players around him. This side would really keep hold of the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Sir Bobby Charlton on Liam Whelan]</b> His forte was to scheme, to shape possibilities with his skill and excellent vision. He scored so many goals from midfield he would be a wonder of today’s game</p>

  <p><b>[on Matt Busby]</b> Matt felt responsible because he had cajoled the parents into allowing their sons to come and play for him. He was hurt by what happened at Munich more than anyone</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sir Bobby Charlton on Paul Scholes]</b> I am sorry for England because they don’t have any player like him. You can talk about others but there is no one else like him. He is the best technical player England has without any question. He could have had a lot more caps if he had carried on. And if I was the manager he would have ended up with more than I did - easy</p>

<h4 id="2015-12-27-retrieve">2015 12 27 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> Aside from all the success, Alex’s biggest achievement has undoubtedly been his adherence to bringing youngsters through and making them part of an attacking team. <a href="matt-busby.html">Sir Matt Busby</a>’s philosophy was exactly the same and when Alex joined the club he immediately wanted to know about the contribution <a href="matt-busby.html">Matt Busby</a> had made and what he had achieved at United</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> and <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a>’s Partnership]</b> We’ve had some magnificent centre halves down the years. But these two form the most formidable pairing of all</p>

<h4 id="2016-02-19-retrieve">2016 02 19 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of Manchester United]</b> Nemanja is unbelievable in the air. He wins absolutely everything. He is so powerful and brave, and he has a fantastic leap to get above the strikers. And he also comes up for set-pieces and scores goals.<br /><br />As a defender he makes the full-backs, the goalkeeper and the midfielders in front of him all feel secure. He is a player you can depend on and put your trust in, and that’s important. I like that he doesn’t try to do too much, he sticks to his task of defending, and does that job very well</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[World Cup winner and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> legend Martin Peters has died aged 76]</b> We shared one of the greatest days of our lives at Wembley and the fact Martin is one of only two Englishman to have scored in a World Cup final gives him a special place in England’s history of the game. He was a fantastic footballer. As a team-mate he was someone I could trust completely to do his job and I am proud to have shared that great day with him</p>
