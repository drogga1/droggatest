  <p><b>[on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I have never seen a man so capable of carrying the burden of following the Old Man (Sir Matt Busby). He has the strength and the powers of leadership and I know if he gets the job the club is in the best possible hands</p>

  <p><b>[Bobby Charlton’s Perfect XI]</b> He <b>[<a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>]</b> was pretty intelligent, too! A real football brain. He had superb control, he was inventive and he could perform magic with a ball to get himself out of trouble instinctively. He got a lot of goals, and although he was so skilful, he didn’t show off - he played to the strengths of the players around him. This side would really keep hold of the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Sir Bobby Charlton on <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>]</b> I am sorry for England because they don’t have any player like him. You can talk about others but there is no one else like him. He is the best technical player England has without any question. He could have had a lot more caps if he had carried on. And if I was the manager he would have ended up with more than I did - easy</p>

  <p><b>[Sir Bobby Chartlon has congratulated England captain Wayne Rooney after the striker became the nation’s record goal scorer]</b> I would like to congratulate Wayne on becoming England’s leading goalscorer. It is a record that I am sure <b>[Rooney]</b> will hold for a long time, and it is clear to see that <b>[Rooney]</b> will go on scoring for <b>[his]</b> club and country for a long time to come.<br /><br />I obviously cannot deny that I am disappointed that I now don’t hold this record, however, I am absolutely delighted that it is Wayne, as captain of my beloved club and country, who now holds this record. I have always been very proud to hold this record. Playing for my country was always an honour and a privilege and something I did with great pride</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> Aside from all the success, Alex’s biggest achievement has undoubtedly been his adherence to bringing youngsters through and making them part of an attacking team. <a href="matt-busby.html">Sir Matt Busby</a>’s philosophy was exactly the same and when Alex joined the club he immediately wanted to know about the contribution <a href="matt-busby.html">Matt Busby</a> had made and what he had achieved at United</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Nemanja is unbelievable in the air. He wins absolutely everything. He is so powerful and brave, and he has a fantastic leap to get above the strikers. And he also comes up for set-pieces and scores goals.<br /><br />As a defender he makes the full-backs, the goalkeeper and the midfielders in front of him all feel secure. He is a player you can depend on and put your trust in, and that’s important. I like that he doesn’t try to do too much, he sticks to his task of defending, and does that job very well</p>

Mourinho is a really good coach but that’s as far as I would go really. He pontificates too much for my liking. He’s a good manager, though. And when it was put to him that Ferguson was an admirer, he said: ‘He doesn’t like him too much, though’.</p>
