  <p><b>[Jonathan Woodgate pays tribute to the late Wales manager]</b> It will be very emotional at all his former clubs which says it all because the fans respected him as much as the players and that speaks volumes. I know that <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and Bolton fans will make sure that he is remembered this weekend but the best thing that the players can do as a tribute is make sure that they perform like he would – really wholeheartedly – and do their best to win their games. He should inspire them<br /><br />When I was a schoolboy at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and we used to watch the first team when he was there at <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a> and I always thought he was brilliant and he will go down in history as one of their greats. We used to think the world of him. He was a whole-hearted player who could absolutely everything. He was good in defence, he was good going forward, he was amazing in the air, he could pass the ball around and he had an eye for goal<br /><br />Gary won the league at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> so he was and always be a legend at <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a>. That midfield of Speed, <b>[Gary]</b> <a href="gary-mcallister.html">McAllister</a>, <b>[Gordon]</b> <a href="gordon-strachan.html">Strachan</a> and (David) Batty was awesome. He was just a superb player<br /><br /><b>[It was when Woodgate left <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> in 2003 that Speed became a colleague]</b> I was with him at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and it was great to play alongside him. I felt privileged. I reckon that along with <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> he was the first name on the team sheet for <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a>. Speedo really helped me settle in <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> which was great because I looked up to him. We had a really good side under Sir Bobby. We had the likes of <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> and Kieron Dyer but Speedo and Alan were definitely the leaders of the team. The young lads used to really look up to them.<br /><br />He was the best professional I ever worked with. The way he went about his work was unbelievable. He was first at everything. He was first in at the training ground and always worked hard. He set a great example. He always did the right things. He was a legend<br /><br />He was great on the training ground and out on the field but when it came to the dressing room banter he was always in there laughing and joking. He was a proper, proper top, top man<br /><br />I couldn’t believe it when I saw on Sky Sports News. Words could not describe how I felt. I was absolutely gobsmacked. It was so unreal. I was completely devastated. You could talk to him about anything. He was just a really nice man. He was really lovely fella. For him to go at such a young age is just too hard to take. It is just horrible and I really feel for all his family. What he did at Wales in a short period of time was unbelievable so they are bound to be terribly upset. It is just a travesty</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Woodgate says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is the only man who could have come in above <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at Tottenham]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> was an incredible manager and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was the only one who could really have come in above him. He’s another incredible manager, a serial winner. If you’re going to sack <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, you replace him with another world-class manager in <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. I’m sure he’ll win a trophy at Tottenham<br /><br />I thought <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> would have won something under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. He did an amazing job on the budget he had but I’m sure their first trophy in 12 years is now on the horizon because <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s a serial winner. He’s incredible, the best there’s been and still top drawer</p>
