  <p><b>[Prospects of St. Louis vs Chicago MLS rivalry excites Brian McBride]</b> I’m really excited. And not just because St. Louis deserves it, and the history of St. Louis. But now you’ve got this rivalry between Chicago and St. Louis. <b>[It]</b> is there in all professional sports that they both have sports in. And now you have it with the Fire and the St. Louis team that’s coming in. It’s going to be really special<br /><br />The most interesting aspect, and one we are very proud of, is the fact that we are the first female majority led ownership group in MLS history, and one of few in all professional sports. This is truly a historic day for St. Louis. I believe it was just a couple months ago we were celebrating our very first Stanley Cup win. So being awarded this MLS team just continues to add to the positive momentum going on in our city. We are providing a great opportunity to bring together many different segments of the community, uniting people and their love for the game. As we have stated from the beginning, we did not want to take resources away from the city. Our goal has always been overwhelmingly to privately finance a team and stadium that fuel the region’s continued growth, bringing people together and creating a lasting legacy for this city</p>

  <p><b>[Brian McBride has been named as the new U.S. men’s national team general manager]</b> I am incredibly honored to once again represent the National Team and the U.S. Soccer Federation. It’s critically important for everyone to understand the privilege and pride that goes with wearing the jersey, and I’m excited about the opportunity to build relationships with players and clubs that align with the philosophy and values of U.S. Soccer.<br /><br />In this position, part of my job is to work alongside Gregg and his staff in fostering a growth mentality for the USMNT and to help Earnie ensure that this mindset is present in all of our Youth National Teams. I look forward to working with Earnie and Kate Markgraf to continue the progress we have made in the last two decades.</p>

  <p><b>[Ferreira, who was approved to join the U.S. program on Friday, broke out in a major way with FC Dallas last season and, at 19, it’s easy to see that his next step could be a big one]</b> I thought Jesus Ferreira was excellent in dropping into that hole and really making the game, connecting, opening things up. They realized it, they condensed the space, and then we started going wide</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT general manager Brian McBride was full of praise for <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Giovanni Reyna</a> this week]</b> You’re 17, and you’re able to make a jump from youth national teams to U23s of a <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> team, and now you’re in the Champions League and making a difference. His growth factor is exponentially greater, then I think most people thought. If you look at player like Gio, certainly his pedigree with with his Dad, you know he has the mentality. The fact that he’s now showing it with the technical side, we’re really happy for him. We’re excited to see him with <b>[the USMNT]</b>, but also really excited to see what lies ahead for him</p>

  <p><b>[How the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> became USMNT players’ league of choice]</b> I think young Americans will continue to come to the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. I think there’s a few factors to explain it. If you look at the amount of scouts that <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> teams put in the United States, so that they can see players at younger ages, I think that is a huge factor. Also, if you look at England, there’s a work permit issue. So, that part is a little bit of the reason why there are not so many in the youth side of it, but I think it’s more down to the fact that Americans have done well in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> understand that there is a wealth of talent that they can find at a younger age and bring in, which is beneficial to everybody</p>
