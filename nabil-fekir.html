  <p><b>[Pressed on whether he had taken in his last game for the club following a 3-2 victory over Nice]</b> Farewell? Frankly, I don’t know. I spent an exceptional season here with players, fans and the staff. We ended up in beauty. You have to pass a course, it is true. I think I gave everything to Lyon. Now it is time to look into the future</p>

No, no really not! We have two teammates who will be playing tomorrow, Raphael Varane and Karim Benzema. May the best team win! If Real could win we would be happy for them.<br /><br />For now I am in Clairefontaine. Games are coming and I really don’t have my situation on my mind. I will let things happen but nothing is done. I have to talk with <b>[Lyon president]</b> Jean-Michel Aulas and we’ll see what happens next</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool transfer target Nabil Fekir insists that he has put the disappointment of his failed switch to Anfield behind him]</b> It’s true that being world champion is very good. But life goes on. That’s not why we have to stop working. There is a good season ahead with Lyon and we must prepare quietly.<br /><br />Yes, the missed transfer to Liverpool is totally digested. These are things that happen. It’s like that. We must advance. It’s ancient history. I heard several things. The real reason is that they <b>[Liverpool]</b> only know it<br /><br />Like every season, we want to try to do the maximum in the league. The podium is a goal of the club. After there is the PSG, a great team with great players, we know that it will be complicated. My goals are always high. Like at the beginning of the season, I set big goals, but honestly there are no specific goals or anything. I try to help the team to the maximum and play all the competitions thoroughly</p>

  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir has hit out at the lies which surfaced on the back of a proposed £53 million transfer to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> breaking down in the summer of 2018]</b> Lots of lies were told and they affected me. Especially those told about my family. It hurt them and me. Especially when you know that what’s being told is false. What was said is not the truth. My knee is good - I had a quick medical check at Clairefontaine (France’s national training base) - my knee wasn’t even mentioned. If my knee had been in such a bad state, would <a href="jean-michel-aulas.html">Aulas</a> (Lyon chairman Jean-Michel) have made <b>[a huge offer to keep me]</b>? But the worst thing is the idea that people could suggest that it’s because of my family that the transfer didn’t happen. It’s a lie. But you have to live with it.<br /><br />You want the truth? Even I don’t know - I promise you! I did my medical and then <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> decided not to sign me. At some point they wanted to have me believe it was because of my knee - but an excuse needed to be found. The medical tests that I did at Clairefontaine were very clear - my knee is perfectly fine and I feel fine. There are no issues at all with my knee</p>
