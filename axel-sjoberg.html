  <p><b>[Built on defense, Colorado Rapids looking for balance in 2017]</b> I think really what made <b>[the record-setting defense]</b> happen is a bunch of guys working hard together. Obviously there’s a lot of quality in there as well, but really, it’s people coming together, working hard for each other and taking on the system.<br /><br />I think honestly we’ve got to keep what we did really well last year as the foundation. We know the process, we know how we want to play in general, but we have to tweak a few things, because you win games not only by defending well but by also scoring. So obviously we’re working on a few different looks and a few different things that can help us not only keep the ball out of the net but score some goals as well<br /><br />That’s something we’ve been stressing all preseason. Trying a few different things but always keep in mind it’s the defense that made us really successful last year. That’s something we don’t want to lose. That’s the core of who we are and we can’t lose that, even though we’re trying to push forward a bit more in certain instances and score some more goals</p>

  <p><b>[The Colorado Rapids have announced that center back Axel Sjoberg will miss at least 6-8 weeks after undergoing left hamstring surgery]</b> We are frustrated for Axel but we will give him our full support during his rehabilitation process. Everyone at the club will be working hard to make sure he is back on the pitch as soon as possible.</p>
