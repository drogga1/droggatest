  <p><b>[<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> confirm <a href="jan-siewert.html">Siewert</a> as new manager after <a href="david-wagner.html">Wagner</a> exit]</b> <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> is delighted to announce the appointment of <a href="jan-siewert.html">Jan Siewert</a> as its new head coach. The 36-year-old joins the Terriers from German side <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> II, where he held the position of head coach, signing a contract running until the summer of 2021.</p>

  <p><b>[Viral sensation makes comic appearance in <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>’s Siewert announcement video]</b> It was absolutely bizarre. I thought the guy who came over to me asking if I was Jan was going to say something like, ‘Excuse me, sir, but you’re sat in the wrong seat’. I had to double take when he asked me if I was Jan. That was all I heard of it and then suddenly everybody’s phones and my phone started going crazy, saying, ‘I’ve just seen you on telly’. There was lots of reaction from people in the crowd - just people coming up and having selfies and people patting me on the back and wishing me luck.<br /><br />I was on my way back up to the table where we were being hosted and a father and son stopped me and the dad said, ‘This is the new manager’. A couple of the girls next to me had pulled up pictures online to search what he looked like and they did a split screen thing. There is a bit of a resemblance so I can sort of understand where they’re coming from - obviously I’m a much more attractive guy, though! I will be following him more closely from now on - my doppelganger. I had no idea about him, I didn’t know who the club had been linked with</p>

We need to focus. It’s a process which has started. I saw many things I implemented in training. The most important thing is we create chances and the goals will come. The lads got my ideas and we had chances</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Mounie earns Jan Siewert’s praise after ending <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a>’s winless run]</b> I’m so proud of Steve Mounié because as a striker you need that feeling of scoring and he’ll really enjoy that tonight. The players won on the pitch tonight, they showed that we will fight to the end. I really believed that the goal would come and in the end it did. Since I arrived here the fans have supported me and it’s incredible how brilliant they are. It’s not just a squad and the staff, it’s all of us and the supporters deserved that tonight.</p>

  <p><b>[Siewert promises <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> will come back stronger following relegation]</b> I think the fans realise what we are doing. There are certain things that go wrong in a season, and we have to find all the things that we are willing to do as a club. It’s great, and the supporters are part of that, and they help to bring us in the right direction. We are really focusing on the stuff that went wrong, and finding a better way to come back stronger<br /><br /><b>[Siewert’s side have now lost five away games on the spin but <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> had their chances at 0-0, Chris Lowe twice denied by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita in the first half]</b> The penalty definitely summed up the season. We haven’t had a penalty ourselves this season, but we’ve conceded eight to 10. The quality in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is so high that it completely takes the game in a different direction. But still, at 1-0 down, we fought and had a chance to equalise. The team on the pitch today made me really proud</p>
