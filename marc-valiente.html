<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The story of Messi’s first days at Barcelona]</b> On the first day, they played him as a partner to Cesc Fabregas in attack. Cesc had a gift. He was a master at reading the game, because he was never well positioned in the rondo <b>[a training drill where a larger group of players tries to keep possession of the ball from a smaller group of defending players]</b>, but he always managed to steal the ball somehow.<br /><br />We were always shown to play with one or two touches. From a young age, we had been taught about control and passing, so the ball moves quickly. But suddenly, here’s a guy who can move the ball in four or five touches at the same speed it took us to pass it<br /><br /><b>[Messi broke the ice]</b> He started to make his first jokes. He was so shy that he hadn’t spoken to anybody before that.<br /><br />Those of us who knew him weren’t surprised to see him in the first team at such a young age, but by the way he adapted to each new stage of his progression</p>
