  <p><b>[Uros Matic is not put off by the pressure as he looks to ensure he is not stuck in his brother’s shadow]</b> Nemanja may be my brother but I am my own player and I think I can find a really good position here in this club and to make a big name for myself. It is always good when you win almost every game in the league and you have a chance to play in the Champions League. I think for every player in the world, this is the dream. It was my dream too. I hear the atmosphere in this stadium is great on those nights, but let’s focus on the next day and then we will see about the big targets. I got the call that Stale <b>[Solbakken: the manager]</b> wants me and I made the step to come to Copenhagen. I think it is the right step for me in this moment and I am ready for it. This is a big club and I have high targets in my career and in my life. I don’t just want to be satisfied just because I am here in a big club. I am here to show my quality and win titles and to make the supporters here very happy in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Leaving home]</b> was difficult for me because I was just 17. It was also a big step from my youth career in Serbia. It was not so close to my hometown so I couldn’t come back every weekend and when you are young man, you can feel this a bit. During the years it has become normal. Football is my work and I enjoy it. The support from the family helped, my brother and mother and father. It was more difficult for my parents because we both left the country so it was tough, but the kids just wanted to play football somewhere.<br /><br />I have been to Slovakia, Portugal, Holland and Austria so for me, it is not a big deal to move to a new country because I will find a way to live and adapt. It is no trouble for me and nothing can surprise me and I am ready for every situation. I have played in many amazing clubs and from each club I have learned something. From the technical staff to the players. I try to be open to learn. When I sign for a club, I always say I want to stay as long as football but you never know what will happen. It is a strange job. Every thing is good for me here at Copenhagen. From the first day everyone was really open with me and it made the adaptation easier to this club and I am thankful for that<br /><br />It would be great to take three points in that game. It is important for everyone. I have met many people here, many fans and it is really nice, I think we are going to enjoy it together. I have seen many videos and the players have spoken about it - it will be special. It is always good when you win almost every game in the league and you have a chance to play in the Champions League. It would be really nice for me and my family <b>[to have both Matic brothers in the Champions League. It would be the best scenario ever to play each other, but we need to both do so many things before this happens. In the next six months, we need to win the title and fight to be in the Champions League</b></p>

  <p><b>[Uros Matic on his family’s tough love]</b> When I came to my first training session in the Kosice first team squad and everyone was there - they all thought: ‘Oh he’s got his brother, they will go easy on each other. The first challenge between me and him in training drew blood! No one expected this and I think they were shocked. If you are a professional, you just have to think about your job, never mind who is your brother or who is your friend. We always had a friendly competition, but I don’t compare my career with his. He has gone to a high level of football and we are all proud of him. Me and my brother, we are really connected. He played a big role in my life. He is my big brother and he has always been a great example to me, both inside and outside of the pitch. He is a good person and he has taught me about everything. He is my blood and we grew up together<br /><br />Macva Sabac in ex-Yugoslavia was a big team and my dad played for them when I was born. They played in the top Yugoslavian league. He had many big names in his team, in ex-Yugoslavian football. I think we learned many things from him. He is more universal than me and my brother. He could play as a striker and a central defender. It depended on the match. When he ended his career he coached kids and taught them their first steps with the ball and I had the possibility to learn so many things from my father. Sometimes he was a little bit straight with me but of course it was a professional upbringing. He knows what it takes to make it, he helped us a lot and everything we have done is because of him and my mother.<br /><br />My village <b>[where my family live]</b> always stays the same, the people get older, but the rest is the same. It is a positive place to be. I like to go back and recharge my batteries. I know everyone. They live together and they work together, they are helping each other and that’s what I like there. I feel comfortable with them <b>[in Vojvodina]</b> and it is nice to go there with the family. It is a big pastime in my life to go there and relax<br /><br />Chelsea are a really big club, it is nice to see a member of my family play in this kind of club, full of legends. It is unbelievable. I am proud and at first it was hard to get used to, but now it is just normal and I don’t get stressed. He is a simple guy and he hasn’t changed in his whole life. You need to keep your values as success is temporary. He is a warrior on the field and can handle the pressures of the games. It is a difficult league to play in with so many good teams and I am happy to see my brother on the top - we will see what happens if they become champions and we will have to celebrate if he does</p>
