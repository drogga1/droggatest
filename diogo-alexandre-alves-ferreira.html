<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan unveil Diogo Alexandre Alves Ferreira as Asian quota foreigner]</b> I spoke to my agent and he spoke very highly about the club. I had some friends who have played in India and as soon as I asked them about the club their reply was this is the biggest club in the country. They are a highly successful team. Last year maybe they didn’t get exactly the results they wanted but hopefully, we can bring back some success this season.<br /><br /><b>[On Cameron Watson]</b> Cameron and I are very good friends. He also praised this club and that’s why I made up my mind to come here<br /><br /><b>[The 27-year-old player was a part of the youth system of Portuguese club FC Porto]</b> I was in their youth setup. The team was very successful then. Jose Mourinho was the coach and there was Deco, Ricardo Quaresma and so many other great players<br /><br /><b>[On why chose to take up the challenge of playing in India]</b> I wanted to experience a different challenge, a different chapter in my life. I had played in the A-League now I have decided to move to India for a new challenge and let’s see where my career goes<br /><br />I like to play as a defensive midfielder or a central-back. Throughout my career, I have played in different positions. I consider myself as a team player and I will play wherever the coach wants me to<br /><br /><b>[He also said that he is looking forward to playing the famous Kolkata Derby]</b> I have heard that it is a massive rivalry. All big teams around the world have rivalries. This is something I am looking forward to.</p>
