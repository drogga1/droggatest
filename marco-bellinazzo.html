  <p><b>[The <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> Effect: What <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> has done for the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> brand]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have been growing year upon year since <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> took over in 2010 but they knew that in order to become a top club on a European level they had to expand their appeal beyond the boundaries of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are trying to position themselves alongside clubs with massive global appeal and huge budgets like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. To compete with these clubs, you need to have a strong squad, but also important players within that squad who have a lot of followers on social media. Quality coupled with popularity enables a club to increase its revenue. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, therefore, was the perfect signing for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to achieve both of their objectives<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> know that they cannot grow any more economically in terms of the Italian football scene. A 40,000-seat stadium is quite small in Champions League terms and you can’t really raise the price of tickets any higher. Even last season’s price hike was met with protests. The TV rights, which are managed by La Lega <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, are difficult to improve upon given the Italian league is not as big a draw internationally as <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> or <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The profits are also divided in such a way that prevents <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> from making as much money from rights as their English rivals.<br /><br />So, all things considered, the club can only grow on an international level commercially. And to do this you need a global icon like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who is very useful in terms of generating new deals in North America and Asia. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, of course, had already been making moves to appeal more to other markets. They changed their logo to make it more modern. This season, they also changed their strip, moving away from their traditional black and white strips because people in America associate such a jersey with referees and umpires. This season they are playing more games at 3pm now so that their games can be watched at reasonable hours in Asia. They have done all of these things to give the club an international appeal<br /><br /><b>[Juve are obviously benefitting from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s presence in the very same way]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> costs <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> around €85m a year in wages, taxes and amortisation (the money the club has committed to paying on an annual basis to cover the striker’s transfer fee over the four years of his contract). The idea that he pays for himself in terms of shirt sales is a nonsense but he has brought a significant boost in terms of merchandising and helped bring about a doubling of the value of their shirt sponsorship and supplier deals. There’s also been an increase in revenue from ticket sales to €70m, which is obviously down to his presence. So, the <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> effect is real. It’s there for all to see.<br /><br />The problem for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, though, in this early stage is that you can also see an increase in costs, not just revenue. It’s evident in the fact that, at the end of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s first year at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, they experienced a €40m loss in spite of the fact that the club made more than €150m in capital gains in the transfer market. This is the sign of an imbalance in expenditure which is related to the wage bill and has been exacerbated by their elimination by <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, which cost the club €20m-€30m.<br /><br />So, this underlines that for all of their commercial gains from signing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, the importance of reaching the latter stages of European competition remains hugely important for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> when it comes to making a profit because they cannot generate anything like the same revenue from competing in Italy. This is why <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> is pushing a lot for an enlarged European competition, a Super League, a more integrated tournament with more games that would generate more income for the top clubs. The English clubs don’t need it because they have the power of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> behind them, while <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are already colossal brands, but <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are a bit like <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in that they have the difficulty of not being able to grow any more within their respective leagues. So, they need a bigger, richer European competition<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was just the first step. He’s an elite signing. There are going to be more. Even though <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> had this operating deficit last year, they recently approved a €300m raise in capital. It’s the second such raise of the <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> era. The other was 2011, a figure of more €120m. Thus, this latest raise of €300m is an incredible figure for the Italian market. This will obviously fund an even more aggressive marketing strategy but also a more aggressive transfer market, which will bring in more big champions of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s calibre.<br /><br />However, such an outlay will have to be offset by the sale of some players and, as we saw during the summer, that’s easier said than done. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> failed to sell several top players in the last window. Consequently, they were dealing with labour costs of €500m in terms of player wages and amortisation. You cannot manage to sustain such costs. So, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> need to quickly offload some of the many players on high wages<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> could eventually be one of those sold. Not yet, obviously. Not before he delivers what he was bought for: the Champions League. They might end up letting him to go to somewhere like China, where <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has a lot of interests and followers. That would be a good transfer for everyone concerned. The bottom line, though, is that by signing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have started down a path that you can’t just decide to abandon. This is a process that you can’t reverse. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have to continue to grow and they have to continue to win. The two are linked. And <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is presently integral to the success of both.</p>
