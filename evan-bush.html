<blockquote>
  <p>[Regulations laid down by MLS mean that teams are not allowed to charter flights for any more than four legs of journeys over the season. This means that there are effectively two matches they can travel privately for, as the inbound and outbound flights each count as one leg – a paltry number given the travelling commitments for teams over a season that will stretch to at least 34 matches] Honestly it’s a joke. You can talk to anybody from the administration to the players and the coaches, the way that the last 24 hours happened should never have happened. The powers that be know how we feel about it. It became a player safety issue. It’s not just a matter of inconvenience for us. We’re lucky that we didn’t have guys get injured today because of the way their bodies were treated the last 24 hours.<br /><br />The people that can make the decisions didn’t want to change anything. I won’t point fingers necessarily, but something needs to be done. The Players Association is aware of it. I understand that there are certain things that they can’t do. But when it comes to player safety, when it comes to the assets of the league - and the players are the assets of the league - they need to do better</p>
