  <p><b>[River Plate midfielder’s agent says No <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> bid for Palacios]</b> Nobody called me from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> because of Palacios – <b>[Inter vice-president Javier]</b> <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> called to let me know that they are following him because he is a player that interests them, but only that. With Inter we spoke, we did not commit to anything. They love the player, <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> told me they are following him.</p>

  <p><b>[Palacios’ agent hopeful of sealing <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move amid <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> interest]</b> I hope he can play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. They have called us from Inter, from Roma, from Wolfsburg. Many clubs are interested but the one that has got the furthest is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. With <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, we got to talk at a moment, but nothing was advanced<br /><br /><b>[While missing out on playing in such a showpiece at his home stadium is a blow for Palacios, the trip to Madrid could be an opportunity to finalise the deal]</b> He, as a River fan and as a player at the club for 10 years, wanted to play the final in the Monumental. But with this problem there, he would also love to play in that stadium <b>[the Bernabeu]</b> in the beautiful country of Spain. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has been very good to us. The two clubs were in talks and were going to follow that with meetings about Exequiel after the finals. In Madrid they are going to talk now</p>

  <p><b>[Palacios’ agent hopeful of sealing Real Madrid]</b> After the Club World Cup, then we will start to talk about numbers. It is possible that we will agree a deal now and he will leave in June. sThen he can start from zero in pre-season, whereas if he goes now it will be with the season already halfway through</p>

  <p><b>[Renato Corsi says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> set to make formal offer for Palacios]</b> The leaders of River got together with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in Abu Dhabi. In the coming days there will be a formal offer and the operation is quite advanced. The family, Exequiel and I want him to go in June and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> don’t have a problem with him staying at River until then. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> want him and supposedly River will sell. They agree, so between Monday and Tuesday the formal proposal will be presented</p>
