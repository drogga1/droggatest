  <p><b>[Adelaide defender Tarek Elrich apologised to the home crowd at Coopers Stadium, who had to wait an hour as kick-off was delayed due to extreme temperatures only to watch their side concede five goals]</b> It’s just not good enough. I feel sorry for the 6000 that came out tonight and for our club. We’ve come off a great season last year and this year is just a total opposite. I can’t even put it into words. It’s very disappointing. I can’t explain it. It is what it is</p>

  <p><b>[Adelaide United have confirmed that Tarek Elrich ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in an A-League clash with Melbourne City. Club’s doctor, Dr James Ilic said]</b> Following scans on Friday evening, we can confirm Tarek has ruptured the ACL in his left knee. Tarek will now see a surgeon on Monday to discuss the best course of action and to begin the recovery process as soon as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[With captain Eugene Galekovic and playmaker Marcelo Carrusca headlining a large group of players expected to leave Adelaide United, defender Tarek Elrich is worried about the Reds’ future]</b> I’m worried about next season, I think we’ve only got about seven or eight players signed. This season that just went past we left our signings very late and it showed. We didn’t take off too quick and we finished off the season on a bit of a high and as bad as it sounds, I can see a repeat of that if the club doesn’t make their decisions soon.</p>
