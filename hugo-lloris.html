We played a great game today but <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> played like a typical Italian team away from home. They wanted to defend and that made it difficult for us.

It is not easy for him, or for people like Paul Pogba with France, because you need to give time to them to get to the right age, to mature.

You can always have some doubt in a difficult time but I don’t think it is a difficult time for him.

Not a lot of people believed in Tottenham at the beginning of the season for the top four places and I think today means more than a trophy because we showed the club is strong even if we had some difficult moments.<br /><br />We need to enjoy it because we’ve played 37 games away from home - that’s the feeling to be honest. You can say whatever you want, but Tottenham isn’t at its home ground and I think the most exciting thing is that next season we will play Champions League in our new stadium. For the fans, the club, the players, the coaching and medical staff it’s a big, big achievement but we need to keep working and to stay ambitious because the next step is to win something</p>

As a football player and as a football fan, I think he had a very good season. He has this desire to shine with the French national team. Will he be the ‘boss’? That’s a strong word but a ‘leader’ is what is expected of him on and off the field. He is reaching maturity and he wants to do well. But it’s also important that he focuses on his individual performance. This is the best way, to lead by example</p>

He’s was a great player and a great gentleman of French football. It is true it is a little bit peculiar to see him with the Belgian team. But that is his career and now he is learning for his future career. I think his heart will be split because before everything he is French. He has lived through great moments with the blue jersey - he has the record of goals scored and the second most caps. He left a mark on the history of Les Bleus. He has a great passion for football.

We are in a good position and we need to carry on in the same way and try to improve the way we play.

Winning and losing changes the perception outside <b>[the club]</b>, and sometimes inside. I think we can see the improvement of the club over the last few years. Tottenham has a great history in football, but it’s not the type of club which used to win every season. If you compare it with bigger institutions like Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern, Juventus, it’s a different project<br /><br />Step by step we are trying to build something strong and stay strong during the years, hopefully the new stadium will give an extra boost, an energy, and we’ll see what the future will be - but the improvement is massive.

When you have this type of facilities, the stadium and the training ground, and when you have fans like Spurs fans, you need to be up there every season. Of course, you cannot create success in three years, we need time and we need to build something very strong but we are in a good way, even if we have ups and downs like every top team. It’s important to stay strong with unity until the end of the season and get into the top four<br /><br />The main thing, first of all, is the three points - we need to put the context out. In the league there are six games to go, four at home and we need to get maximum points. Then we can talk about the stadium. It’s an amazing feeling to play here. It’s a new chapter in Tottenham’s history and we’ve started it in the best way, with a win, which was important after the bad moments we had last month.

I think he took the decision very early, so I think he was sure. You have to accept that. But it was not easy for us to come back into the game, even if we tried to stick with the principle and we tried to play like we used to do. But we didn’t create too much, unfortunately. In the last 15 minutes, we tried to push by shooting from long distance, but it was not enough today. We don’t have to blame the referee.
