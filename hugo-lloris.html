There can always be hazards, but my goal is to be ready for January. Whether it’s the beginning, the middle or the end, I don’t know. In any case, I’ll take time to make sure I’m well healed and that I can come back in top form. I’m also using the time to regenerate myself. I’ve never been away from the pitch for so long, so it’s something new, but I’m treating it positively. I’m using this period to spend time with my family and my children. I’m in good hands and we’re moving forward calmly. Everything’s been done as it should have been. Now, we have to focus on rehabilitation, strengthening, gradually gaining mobility and confidence</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has said that the mission of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> at the club is simply to win a trophy]</b> He’s got a specific mission, which is to get what we lack: a trophy. We want to continue with what we’ve done in recent years, playing magnificent football, getting close to some of the greatest teams, but without rewards for our efforts. At the same time, I have always thought since I was 17 that the influence of the players is the most important thing. That stopping the negative spiral depends on us<br /><br /><b>[Lloris has not had the chance to feature under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> due to a dislocated elbow sustained in a freak accident against Brighton]</b> I had never felt pain like it. I think the morphine took a long time to work and I’m not sure the gas I was given when I was on the pitch worked. I was only relieved at the hospital<br /><br />The idea is to be back by the end of January but that’s conditioned by how I feel and the choices of the coach. All matches are important and the team is not where it would like to be. So you have to think carefully: I will have to be 100% to come back. The luck that I had is that it could have been much more serious. If there had been a fracture, perhaps the question of missing the Euros would have arisen. There was also no damage to the nerves: just a ligament and some muscle tears. But it still took three good months<br /><br />I’ve always had a side to me that’s a daredevil. It’s not conscious. I always liked to dive headfirst, I always looked for the thrills. So it will come back on its own. I’ve quickly regained confidence in my body</p>

I don’t know what’s going to happen between now and the end of the season, but we have to keep faith. We have stopped the negative run, but it’s not enough because we wanted to win<br /><br />We’ve had a very difficult season.

  <p><b>[Lloris: It’s a privilege to work with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> every day]</b> He’s great. He’s a character. So of course, through the media, you can have preconceived ideas, but when you get in touch with him on a daily basis, inside a training centre, I think it’s a privilege. He’s coached so many great teams, so many great players. He’s got a lot of experience and a lot of trophies in his cupboard. When you’re a player, I think it’s a chance to be at his side because there’s so much to learn</p>

What happened between me and Son is just something that is part of football sometimes, but there is no problem at all. You can see at the end of the game we are more than happy to be part of the team and to have the three points. To concede a chance six seconds before half time because we don’t press properly. It annoyed me but it’s part of football, no problem, we move on.</p>
