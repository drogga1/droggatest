  <p><b>[Hugo Lloris comments on <a href="fabien-barthez.html">Fabian Barthez</a>’s comments who says he was a better goal keeper than Brad Friedel]</b> The choice lies with the coach but I’m here to shake things up a bit. I’m not worried, if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> came looking for me at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, then surely I will play a part in the future of the club.

We played a great game today but Lazio played like a typical Italian team away from home. They wanted to defend and that made it difficult for us. But now we have to continue to work hard because we want to win the next game in this competition</p>

So we don’t need to add any more words about this<br /><br /><b>[Lloris knows Spurs must prove worthy of that confidence when they take the field]</b> The belief is even stronger than before.

Every big game can be decisive, so it is important to be ready. The focus has to be very strong from the start. The only thing Saturday’s result will tell us is the truth of that one game. But we all know it is the type of game that could make the difference. After a season like last one the most difficult thing is to keep the same level. So if you can increase it even a bit, there is a chance to create an opportunity such as reaching the final of the Champions League as we did a few months ago. But there is no secret about how you get there. It is about work, it is about mentality, it is about personality</p>

If you want to stay in contact with the best team in the Premier League, it’s important to get this feeling. There were some games that we lost <b>[last term]</b> that we should have drawn. We all know the difficulty of playing at City, so it’s a good feeling to build confidence. With humility, Liverpool and City are the real contenders. We’re going to try our best to challenge for top spot, but it’s difficult to find the consistency. We just need to try to use the experience of the last few years in the best way and it’s about details - to not lose a game, especially a game you do not deserve to win. You draw, you take a point and it’s very good because your rivals share the point with you. Now it’s just to keep the consistency. Consistency is the key</p>

I still have a few years ahead of me. In any case, I will do everything to make the most of it. You also have to know when to say stop at the right time, but I’m not against the idea of ​​discovering something new. That could be the United States.

The next two games against Red Star will become even more important - we cannot lose any more points. I think they (Bayern) showed respect to us because it’s the stamp of the big club - when they have the chance, they kill you. This is what happened in the last 10 minutes. I don’t think the level of both teams is far away like the score, but we need to accept they were much better than us. I feel really bad for the fans mainly because we gave up a little bit too easily and the score was even worse. It’s a night that affects us a lot. Now it’s about character, clearing the mind<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham’s defeat was their fourth already this season in all competitions, including last week’s loss to League Two side Colchester on penalties in the Carabao Cup]</b> The first thing is to find the confidence back in a few games in a row, not just one game. The key is togetherness. It was one of our strengths of the last few seasons and we need to get back on basics. It’s a collective failure and we need to find a solution to find the consistency that was our strength in the last few years. Since the start of the season we’ve never played at the same intensity for 90 minutes. As you see we’re used to playing in a way that demands a lot of energy and focus, and at this level the opponent punishes you when you start to lose easy balls close to the box. Today we feel bad for the badge, we feel bad for the fans, and now it’s to show a reaction on Saturday. That game has become even more important for us</p>

We want to continue with what we’ve done in recent years, playing magnificent football, getting close to some of the greatest teams, but without rewards for our efforts.

I was only relieved at the hospital<br /><br />The idea is to be back by the end of January but that’s conditioned by how I feel and the choices of the coach. All matches are important and the team is not where it would like to be. So you have to think carefully: I will have to be 100% to come back. The luck that I had is that it could have been much more serious. If there had been a fracture, perhaps the question of missing the Euros would have arisen. There was also no damage to the nerves: just a ligament and some muscle tears. But it still took three good months<br /><br />I’ve always had a side to me that’s a daredevil. It’s not conscious. I always liked to dive headfirst, I always looked for the thrills. So it will come back on its own. I’ve quickly regained confidence in my body</p>

  <p><b>[Hugo Lloris believes last season’s Champions League final heartbreak]</b> Wow, it’s difficult to explain. Last season, we went on an incredible run in the Champions League and we finished the season on our knees, and you don’t have time to recover from one season before you have to start a new one<br /><br />There was the accumulation of things that provoked the situation, and then of course a lot of injured players. The change of manager. It’s difficult to stay stable and to be always looking at the top. There is sometimes one season when everything goes against you<br /><br />It’s like a new season that is going to start. It’s true to say we were not at our best, but it belongs to the past. The team will look different to a few months ago. We are more or less all fit, this is a big difference. He <b>[Kane]</b> is ready. In his mind he is ready and that’s the most important thing. He recovered very well from his bad injury and he is the one really looking forward to getting back into the competition. Everyone knows his targets, his ambition and his willingness to win. We all need the repetition of games to reach our best level, but that is going to be the case even for the opponents we are going to play. Harry is in a good place and just waiting to start the season again, like all of us</p>

  <p><b>[Lloris plays down clash with Son]</b> It just belongs to the changing room. Outside you can say whatever you want. There is a lot of respect between all the players. What happened between me and Son is just something that is part of football sometimes, but there is no problem at all. You can see at the end of the game we are more than happy to be part of the team and to have the three points. To concede a chance six seconds before half time because we don’t press properly. It annoyed me but it’s part of football, no problem, we move on.</p>
