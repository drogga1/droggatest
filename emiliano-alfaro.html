<blockquote>
  <p>[The Uruguayan striker, Emiliano Alfaro, talks about his switch to FC Pune City after representing the Highlanders last season] I feel happy to be joining FC Pune City. I was impressed with the city and the people even last season when we came to play here and the experience was brilliant. Then the coach [Antonio Habas] called me and the management was very nice. We will have a good team and I’m happy.<br /><br />Of course, I received offers from other clubs but finally I decided to sign with Pune because they gave me the best offer<br /><br />[On Antonio Habas] He is a very good coach and knows the league very well. I think he knows it better than most other coaches. He’s preparing for the next season with most dedication. With his experience, it’s more easy to build a competitive team for next season<br /><br />The changes in the ISL are for the better and if you want to be more competitive, then you should adapt. As it is with most top leagues, the season should be long and next year it will be longer and it is only for the good. It is good for the football in India and the Indian players.<br /><br />I don’t think the reduction in foreigners starting is a big problem. Many teams would be having less players in their squad. It won’t be a big problem at all<br /><br /> UAE, the level of the local players are good and the teams are good. But you have only 3 foreign players in one team. So, the level can be a little bit down. Also, there are not many fans coming to watch the games. Here in India, the stadiums are full at many places<br /><br />[Before he signed out, Alfaro laid down the targets for the coming season] Our target is to win the league. To do that you have to work hard and need to show team work. We need to start from the beginning. Everybody wants to win the final. It is going to be difficult and but we wil try to win the league</p>
