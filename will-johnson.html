  <p><b>[MLS Cup fever has struck Toronto, and it’s hard not to notice]</b> I think you embrace it, it’s fun! The more people that show up, the better, right? This is what we do. We want to play the best soccer we can play to entertain and to get results and get 36,000 people on their feet like we did last week. That’s what we want to do.<br /><br />We’ve earned the right for people to come and for us to be able to showcase what we’re all about here at Toronto FC to North America and the world. All of us want to get to the game as quickly as possible but this week is special for a reason<br /><br />You’ve earned the right to be a part of this week so go soak it up, enjoy it, but stay focused on the game and not all the other stuff around the game - and then afterwards reflect and hopefully have no regrets, leave everything you’ve got on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC’s Will Johnson ready to celebrate as he eyes third MLS Cup]</b> It was brutally hard to watch it, but I knew I wasn’t starting so it’s not like it was a surprise. It was tough. I had put a lot into the Portland project, but it was nice to see all the hard work that I put into it, and did for that group, was parlayed into success. That, for me, was gratifying, but once the season was over I felt I needed a change. It wasn’t easy, it was a heck of a move <b>[from Portland]</b>. Family wise, off the field, it was brutally tough. I can’t understate that side of things, but from Day One you get to this <b>[Toronto FC]</b> club, this training ground, this city, you know this is special.<br /><br /><b>[Johnson’s belief in TFC was cemented even further after a chance encounter with Larry Tanenbaum]</b> He knew details of my career that blew me away. He knew about my leg break, about my time in Holland. He was so in-depth with the details that my wife Caroline and I were blown away, and so that was one of the things that made me say, ‘This is different, this is cool’.<br /><br />Every year that you play in this league, you see it grow and you see the quality of players rise, it gets harder and harder to win MLS Cup and they become more and more meaningful. The MLS Cups that were won in the late 90s and early 2000s were small numbers, and now we’re dealing with 20 teams in the league, major superstars, so every year it gets harder to do, and more special</p>

  <p><b>[Cyle Larin sees transfer speculation as motivation, not distraction]</b> I can’t even imagine those kinds of things flying around in the news with social media these days. The way he handles that to me is impressive. I’m not sure I’ve seen a young player handle it as well as he does. When that day comes <b>[to move abroad]</b> it’ll come, but until then he’s 100 percent focused on Orlando City and he performs every single week for us.<br /><br />He’s taken on more responsibility, more ownership in who he is as a player and what he skill set means to a team. I think it’s very important that he realizes he needs to have a strong voice because of his playing style and his contribution to the team</p>

  <p><b>[On NYCFC]</b> For me, they’re a harder team to play away from home because they’ve got good footballers, and on this tight field it kind of takes away their advantage of what their special players bring to the table. So we were able to keep our lines tight, get the ball wide and get some crosses in on this small field, and Cyle was able to produce a couple of finishes for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Cyle Larin]</b> He’s starting to really get it in terms of being a professional. His weight’s down, his fitness is up, his stamina’s up. He’s a real handful for 90 minutes now - not just for the first 45 to 50 minutes of a game. He’s a handful all game, and he’s manhandling guys, holding the ball up and using his size.</p>
