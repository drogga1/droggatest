<a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> has suggested that midfielder Ivan Perisic does not fit into the system that he wants to play at Inter this season</p>

  <p><b>[Perisic closing on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> move after undergoing medical]</b> Yeah, I just had the medical check-up</p>

  <p><b>[Perisic joins <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> on initial loan from Inter]</b> I am very happy to be back in Germany. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is one of the biggest clubs in Europe. We want to attack not only in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and in the DFB-Pokal, but also in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Perisic had no doubts about joining <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> once the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> champions came calling, even if he was not their first-choice target]</b> t happened really quickly. Everybody knows what happened <b>[with Sane]</b>, and I hope he recovers well and quickly. But when they called me, I took only a few hours to take my decision with my family. When a club like <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> call, you cannot say no. That’s the reason I’m here. I want to do the best here every day, each game and I hope it’s going to be a successful year.<br /><br />I’m coming here to be part of the team, and to play. There are a lot of games, and at this level you cannot play all the games. We need everybody, at least 17, 18 players if you want to be on top. You know during the season there’s going to be injuries, so we’ll need everybody<br /><br /><b>[Perisic scored eight <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> goals for Inter, who he joined in 2015, last term, though believes his form was hindered due to a lack of rest following Croatia’s run to the World Cup final]</b> The last year was a really difficult one after the final. I had not even 20 days for recovery. When I returned to Inter I was back in the side for the first game of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. That was the reason the season was many ups and many downs. When you look at all the players who played in the final, you will see maybe one or two that had a really good season. But this season I had a really good pre-season with Inter, with the new coach <b>[Antonio]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> he is a really hard worker, and it’s going to help me a lot here</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Perisic has admitted that it was painful to miss out on a dream move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but insists he is happy at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and hopes to stay at the club]</b> How close was I going there? Very close. It was an amazing thing for me when Jose called me. It was difficult to say no to him. In fact, I really, really wanted to join him and play for United. It was a dream of mine to play in all the big leagues. But it didn’t happen. It was painful for me. But I don’t want to go into the details. I only found out myself the real reasons two years later.<br /><br /><b>[Although the ex-Wolfsburg and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> player knows he was not the club’s first choice, he is confident he can keep impressing at the Allianz Arena and earn a long-term deal with <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a>’s team]</b> We are talking about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, one of the best five clubs in the world. They always have three, four or five possibilities for every position they’re interested in. I was not the first. It happened very quickly. Everyone knows the story: after Sane got injured, the club contacted Inter and then my agent. I thought about it with my family for one night. Then I agreed. I believe in myself enough to think that I can convince the club to make my move permanent. That’s my wish. I will do anything I can to make it happen</p>
