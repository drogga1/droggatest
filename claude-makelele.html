  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Claude Makelele speaks about comparisons made between himself and new Blues signing <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a>]</b> This position is so difficult to play. You need leadership. It’s about working with your <b>[midfield]</b> partner, understanding each other. I do like <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kanté</a>, but whether he’ll be better than me at it I don’t know. He needs time to learn the position, to learn more about the game. He’s a young player I like, but I hope he doesn’t get to be better than I was!</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Makelele has joined Swansea City as assistant coach to new boss Paul Clement until the end of the season]</b> Swansea City is pleased to confirm that former French international Claude Makelele has joined the club’s coaching staff. The 43-year-old, who has signed a deal until the end of the season, reunites with head coach Paul Clement, who he worked with during his playing stint at Chelsea and as a coach with Paris Saint-Germain. The former Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSG midfielder has been named as an assistant coach… Makelele will get his first taste of the Liberty on Saturday when he’s in the dug-out for the Swans’ Premier League fixture with Arsenal.</p>

Paul has given me the opportunity to come back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and I’m very grateful because I’ve really missed it. I know him very well and he knows me too.

  <p><b>[From Ligue 1 to Superstardom - Claude Makelele]</b> We won the league in 1995 and the following year reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. For a young team from a small club like Nantes to play a semi-final against Juventus was incredible. We lost 4-3, but it was a beautiful adventure and it made me even more ambitious. I saw myself going to a big club and winning big trophies.<br /><br /><b>[With a home World Cup on the horizon, Makelele rejected interest from abroad]</b> The pressure was enormous and the team was hardly superb. It was a season of sufferance. After Marseille, I came to appreciate football again in Vigo. I arrived at a club I didn’t know anything about so it was a bit of an adventure</p>

  <p><b>[On Paul Pogba]</b> I told him when I met him that he can take on the responsibility <b>[of helping France win honours]</b> because he is a great player. He has everything. He is tall, with great technique, he can score goals, he gets assists - he has everything. He shouldn’t be scared and he should just do the job.<br /><br />These young players need to understand that when you wear the shirt of the national team that you need to die for this shirt. In my generation, everyone was dying for the shirt. You need to understand this. When you wear this shirt, you have the whole country behind you. The players need to understand that. I think when they understand that, then they will win the World Cup again</p>

  <p><b>[Why new AC Milan signing Bakayoko failed at Chelsea]</b> He’s not one to get scared. He makes the decisions all the time, sometimes it’s wrong, but this kind of player will make mistakes in order to get better. He has quality as a dribbler, passer, the timing of the pass. He’s good, very good. Now he needs one manager that will make him a big player.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s goal celebrations are disrespectful to his opponents]</b> One example is Thierry Henry. When he scored a goal before, so many goals, he’s never happy. One day I ask Thierry, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘It’s the way I celebrate my goal. I know people don’t like this, but I’m like this. I can’t change this. For me, it means sometimes you don’t respect your opponent, you know? It’s frustrating. I’m fronting Pogba. If I was a player I would want to tell him, ‘Listen, do this in the dressing room, not now. It’s frustrating. You win 4-0, you’re dancing in front of me’.<br /><br /><b>[On Ronaldinho]</b> I have a lot of history, not just Ronaldinho. It’s football - sometimes you need to explain to the player in front of you, give a little bit of respect, also</p>

  <p><b>[When it came to picking the best player he ever played with]</b> I’m not going to say <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, because he’s my friend and I’m always talking about him! I’m going to say Ivan Helguera, who played in midfield with me at Madrid. We had a great chemistry; we’d train together, we’d eat together. He knew where I’d move on the pitch, I’d know when he was going to push up and try and score. We didn’t even need to talk, just a look was enough to know what the other was going to do<br /><br /><b>[Makelele was also asked to compare <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> with the Brazilian <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> You can’t compare the two! They play different positions - they had different leadership qualities. I trained a lot with both <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, and sometimes I’d stay back after training with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> to practise one-on-ones. I know why he wanted to do this, because he wanted to work on his qualities as a dribbler, his movement, because he’d spend every game getting kicked by his markers and he wanted to train like that too. But you just can’t compare him and Ronaldo: they’re both geniuses and both changed world football, but in different ways</p>
