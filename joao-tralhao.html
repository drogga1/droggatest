  <p>[Joao Tralhao is one of the coaches who picked up the baton and helped Florentino achieve his potential] I met Florentino when he was a young player, when he first joined Benfica. He was a very good professional as a player, very shy as a person, he didn’t like to socialise so much, he was very calm.<br /><br />[Tralhao was in charge of Benfica’s Under-19s, so did not get his hands on Florentino right away, but quickly noted how he had improved] He had changed a lot, in a positive way. I think from U12 to U19 was an amazing learning curve for him, because the potential was there, he was a top, top player when you talk about potential, and then he grew a lot<br /><br />He was very quick to learn, he had a very good capacity to understand the collective work, as you can see now as a senior player, he always understood how he could be a team player. The first work on that was easy with him, because he understood very quickly, and then he had some things to improve, things like attacking, building attacks, to be more focused on offensive principles<br /><br />[Attacking talents such as Joao Felix and Jota, who both stepped up to the first team, as well as highly rated Ze Gomes were also involved in an Under-19 team that reached the 2017 UEFA Youth League final. And with so much flair in the team, Florentino’s defensive acumen was vital] Florentino was one of the most important players in that season. He was very important for our team, we were a very offensive team, we played with only two midfielders. Florentino and Gedson, and the front four was only attacking-minded players like Jota, Felix, Ze Gomes, because when I say that Florentino was very important that season, it’s because he can allow players like Felix and the other ones to be creative, to be offensive. Florentino was always defending and protecting their back. Defensively he is a top, top class player, he can understand very well the game, he understands how the positions should be, he understands how the timings should be to intercept the ball, he was always very, very, very good in the contact, in duels, so the main focus to work with him was the offensive principles<br /><br />Honestly I believe he will not be so many more years hidden in Portugal. Because I know him very well, I think the major clubs in Europe are attracted to these kind of players and they will come to Lisbon to bring him to their club. Florentino is the type of player that all the major clubs want to have in their squads, because he’s still very young but he’s a very talented player in the one position that it’s sometimes not easy to find. It’s not easy to find someone like him in Europe, even in the world. A player who can defend like anyone is excellent, his perception of his defensive role is amazing, absolutely amazing, his perception of the positioning, the timing is completely exceptional, and attacking he can play, he can build, he can do everything the coach wants</p>
