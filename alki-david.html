  <p><b>[Tyson’s cannabis company also open to bidding for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> naming rights]</b> It’s a great stadium. It’s something we’ve specifically been looking for to adopt in our company and it seemed like an amazing idea. My company is a cannabis company and Spain has a long tradition within the European Union as being a leader or a liberal in the road towards legalisation, so it’s evolved quite naturally.<br /><br />This is an opportunity that I am bullish about. It is an historic moment in the history of sport and it fits well with my current plans. Contact was opened at the start of the week and I am quietly confident the deal will be secured.<br /><br /><a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> got just over £18 million for their annual rights, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are now seeking £25m, but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are on a different level. This deal with the Nou Camp (sic) is another way to help. It is full of all the energy that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> stands for. My health company has been working hard with top virologists, including the UK’s Dr Dorothy Bray, to look at any way we can hit this virus. Swissx Nou Camp has a nice ring to it. That is my preferred choice at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Swissx CEO Alki David has said that his cannabis company is currently in talks with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> I’m not walking away from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, I’m keeping the door wide open. But we are now engaged with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt. They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.<br /><br />When I first came to England, everybody was supporting <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and everybody was red. Being contrary, I liked blue and I liked the logo so randomly I selected <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> to support. So it’s sort of a mystical come around.<br /><br /><b>[Whether David secures a deal with either club remains to be seen, but things do not look promising given <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have denied there has been any contact with one of the world’s leading cannabidiol (CBD) producers]</b> They’re just being d<em>cks. My door is open. The bottom line is they are being really precious about this being a cannabis brand, but they’ve got to realise that UFC embraces cannabis, and other major sporting leagues accept cannabis. My brand is not a f</em>cking marijuana brand, it’s a wellness CBD brand based on health, not based on recreation</p>
