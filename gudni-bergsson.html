  <p><b>[Iceland national team included in FIFA 18. KSI chairman Gudni Bergsson announced the news of Iceland’s inclusion]</b> I am very pleased with this result and consider it a good news for all those who play the game in Iceland and really around the world. I think this is a positive result for Icelandic football, fun for our supporters and also the players themselves.</p>

  <p><b>[Iceland’s USA tour shines a light on one of the World Cup’s Cinderella stories]</b> I was training on gravel pitches, you didn’t really train a lot in the winter.<br /><br />Gradually, the players, the kids, have seen Icelandic players go abroad and play professionally and I think it’s developed into the fact that a lot of young boys who are training as footballers have that dream for themselves now to become professional players. There’s that ambition now, and with the facilities and the coaching we have now, players have more support to realize that dream<br /><br />At this stage it’s so easy to be complacent and say we’ve got the world at our feet, but now is exactly the time when you have to be on your guard and say, let’s enjoy the moment but look ahead and see how we can sustain this success. How can we repeat it? How can we not drop too far when this generation stops playing. We’re going to take a dip at some stage, I’m sure, but I would like to develop Iceland football and try to sustain the success and keep improving</p>
