  <p>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam is ready to take the risk of playing the first few matches of the new season with only two import players in the squad] For now, we could not find any foreign players that suit us, so for the first game, we will play only Forkey Doe and Ugo Ukah, and the rest are all local players. This week we have two or three more players who will trial for us, and from there we will evaluate them whether they can play with us or not. We are looking to find partner for Forkey, to add more strength in front, so we are looking for No 10.<br /><br />Pressure is normal for a coach. I have to handle that. We are doing okay with the preparations and we have one more week to do so. The players’ fitness are getting better. Against KL, despite the fact that we lost the game, I think we played a very good game, and we can see positive things from the players. They played a good attacking game<br /><br />[On Zarif Irfan Hishamuddin] We will look at the condition of Azhan first, and Irfan will be on standby. If Irfan plays, then I think he will be able to handle the pressure and do well. For Azlan, he will need at least three or four more days before he can return to training<br /><br />Pulau Pinang are a good team. They have prepared for the new season since two months ago, but for us we are not under pressure. I don’t pressure the players. We are going to make preparations and the players are very determined. They are very confident of getting the three points</p>

  <p>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam has praised his players after they recorded a 2-0 victory at home over Pulau Pinang] Overall as a coach, I think we played a very good game, especially in the second half. We defended more compared to the first half but the players were committed and gave their 200%. Their confidence level was very high and they worked as a team. [Pulau Pinang] are a very tough team, but we created a lot chances, we had our chances. We didn’t really focus on the finishing drills during training so we will improve on that.<br /><br />[He singled out youngsters Adam Nor Azlin and Syahmi Safari for showing impressive performances] It’s not about the formation, but it was the players who showed great determination and worked very hard. I am very proud with my players especially Syahmi and Adam. We can see that they played one of their best games tonight. They were very confident. Adam scored a goal and Syahmi was a constant threat to the opponents with his offensive runs and crosses. The midfielders also did exactly what I wanted them to do, and they only lacked match fitness and they will improve in the next games</p>
