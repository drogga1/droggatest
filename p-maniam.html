  <p>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam is ready to take the risk of playing the first few matches of the new season with only two import players in the squad] For now, we could not find any foreign players that suit us, so for the first game, we will play only Forkey Doe and Ugo Ukah, and the rest are all local players. This week we have two or three more players who will trial for us, and from there we will evaluate them whether they can play with us or not. We are looking to find partner for Forkey, to add more strength in front, so we are looking for No 10.<br /><br />Pressure is normal for a coach. I have to handle that. We are doing okay with the preparations and we have one more week to do so. The players’ fitness are getting better. Against KL, despite the fact that we lost the game, I think we played a very good game, and we can see positive things from the players. They played a good attacking game<br /><br />[On Zarif Irfan Hishamuddin] We will look at the condition of Azhan first, and Irfan will be on standby. If Irfan plays, then I think he will be able to handle the pressure and do well. For Azlan, he will need at least three or four more days before he can return to training<br /><br />Pulau Pinang are a good team. They have prepared for the new season since two months ago, but for us we are not under pressure. I don’t pressure the players. We are going to make preparations and the players are very determined. They are very confident of getting the three points</p>

  <p>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam has praised his players after they recorded a 2-0 victory at home over Pulau Pinang] Overall as a coach, I think we played a very good game, especially in the second half. We defended more compared to the first half but the players were committed and gave their 200%. Their confidence level was very high and they worked as a team. [Pulau Pinang] are a very tough team, but we created a lot chances, we had our chances. We didn’t really focus on the finishing drills during training so we will improve on that.<br /><br />[He singled out youngsters Adam Nor Azlin and Syahmi Safari for showing impressive performances] It’s not about the formation, but it was the players who showed great determination and worked very hard. I am very proud with my players especially Syahmi and Adam. We can see that they played one of their best games tonight. They were very confident. Adam scored a goal and Syahmi was a constant threat to the opponents with his offensive runs and crosses. The midfielders also did exactly what I wanted them to do, and they only lacked match fitness and they will improve in the next games</p>

  <p>[On Melaka United FC] Of course we could see that Melaka are a good side. They simply dominated the first half. I think they are one of the best teams at the moment as they have good players. But at the same time, after we made some changes, I think we managed to get back in the game and create better chances to finally score the equaliser. After that, we also created several more chances to score. Regardless, of course it’s a good result for Selangor to collect one point. Once again I want to say that Melaka are one of the best teams and they have quality players. You could see that for yourselves.<br /><br />The introduction of Astafei at the beginning of the second half certainly changed the game. But I could see that Francis Doe still needs to work on his fitness because he previously lack practice time. The fitness is there but it still needs improving. Another of our new import players, Juliano Mineiro [Brazil-born Timor Leste player] has been registered. But he was not in the squad tonight because we want to prepare him ahead of our next match, against PKNS FC on Saturday. We are still monitoring his fitness. If it is good, there’s a good chance he will be picked for the first time<br /><br />Of course for young players, it’s not easy for them to perform [at the senior level], but I think Adam [forward Adam Nor Azlin] and Syahmi [winger Syahmi Safari] gave their best, and Kannan [defender Kannan Kalaiselvan] as well came on and took the team to another level. Of course we have these players so we have to work with them, and I believe with them in the squad, we can do a good job</p>

  <p>[Selangor boss Maniam Pachaiappan has chalked down Negeri Sembilan’s win over his side in the second round of the FA Cup on Tuesday to luck] All my players gave their 100% commitment throughout the 90 minutes, we had many chances, it was an open game. The only thing that we didn’t do was score goals.<br /><br />With our performance today, we shouldn’t have been dragged into the penalty shootout. And when it’s penalty, it’s [down to] luck, the team with luck will qualify. I think Negeri Sembilan had luck, so they went through. My players gave their best, we could see they gave their all, tried to find the back of the net, only they failed to do so<br /><br />It’s not easy for the players to convert a penalty, because they’ve played the 90 minutes as well as the extra-time. They have to concentrate but they are already tired. It [failure to convert penalties] happens, so we have to accept it, and start focusing on the next match. We have only this set of players, so we need to give them a chance, motivate them, instill positive thoughts, and work on them during training so they can improve</p>

  <p>[Maniam providing best care to avoid burnout to youngster Syahmi Safari] He’s been playing continuously, of course I’m worried about getting him injured. We have to treat him very carefully. What’s important is his recovery, getting him to stretch more, and trying to reduce his loading. I think all these will take him to another level.</p>

  <p>[Selangor head coach, Maniam Pachiappan is full of praise for his players after they comfortably defeated Kelantan 2-0 away] The players showed great commitment. We can see that they worked really hard during the game and that is why we got the win. We had plenty of chances in the first half, and we focused more on defending in the second half. The players did well and really focused on getting the three points.<br /><br />[On Syahmi Safari] For a 19-year-old, we can see that he continues to improve in every game. He played well going forward especially when he is playing on the right side</p>

  <p>[The pragmatic Selangor boss is happy that his men did what they had set out to achieve against the in-form Kedah in their MSL match] For the players, the management and also for the supporters, this one point feels like a win! Throughout the match Kedah controlled the game, our target had been to avoid conceding. Our boys played very well. We were down 1-0 and had to make a decision, to bring on an attacking player [Nurshamil Ghani] and press them, and it worked. We were awarded a penalty and converted it.</p>

  <p>[P Maniam still happy with Selangor’s performance despite defeat to Perak] In the first half we didn’t play that well, but in the second half we came back stronger. We could see a lot of positive things in the team and we were slowly creating chances. …But then Ukah [centre back Ugo Ukah] received his second yellow card and they [Perak] got a penalty, and the game changed.<br /><br />With 10 players Selangor showed good character, especially the [more] senior players like Razman [Roslan], Shamil [Nurshamil Abdul Ghani], Bunyamin [Omar]. They worked really hard, I’m happy with the players’ performance<br /><br />That [new signing] is too early I think. We need time to make decisions and talk to the management. These are the players we have now, and with them we have to work together. That’s the most important thing and we [now] have a one-month break. This one month break, we have to prepare the team [and take them] to another level</p>
