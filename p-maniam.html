  <p><b>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam is ready to take the risk of playing the first few matches of the new season with only two import players in the squad]</b> For now, we could not find any foreign players that suit us, so for the first game, we will play only Forkey Doe and Ugo Ukah, and the rest are all local players. This week we have two or three more players who will trial for us, and from there we will evaluate them whether they can play with us or not. We are looking to find partner for Forkey, to add more strength in front, so we are looking for No 10.<br /><br />Pressure is normal for a coach. I have to handle that. We are doing okay with the preparations and we have one more week to do so. The players’ fitness are getting better. Against KL, despite the fact that we lost the game, I think we played a very good game, and we can see positive things from the players. They played a good attacking game<br /><br /><b>[On Zarif Irfan Hishamuddin]</b> We will look at the condition of Azhan first, and Irfan will be on standby. If Irfan plays, then I think he will be able to handle the pressure and do well. For Azlan, he will need at least three or four more days before he can return to training<br /><br />Pulau Pinang are a good team. They have prepared for the new season since two months ago, but for us we are not under pressure. I don’t pressure the players. We are going to make preparations and the players are very determined. They are very confident of getting the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor head coach, P. Maniam has praised his players after they recorded a 2-0 victory at home over Pulau Pinang]</b> Overall as a coach, I think we played a very good game, especially in the second half. We defended more compared to the first half but the players were committed and gave their 200%. Their confidence level was very high and they worked as a team. <b>[Pulau Pinang]</b> are a very tough team, but we created a lot chances, we had our chances. We didn’t really focus on the finishing drills during training so we will improve on that.<br /><br /><b>[He singled out youngsters Adam Nor Azlin and Syahmi Safari for showing impressive performances]</b> It’s not about the formation, but it was the players who showed great determination and worked very hard. I am very proud with my players especially Syahmi and Adam. We can see that they played one of their best games tonight. They were very confident. Adam scored a goal and Syahmi was a constant threat to the opponents with his offensive runs and crosses. The midfielders also did exactly what I wanted them to do, and they only lacked match fitness and they will improve in the next games</p>

  <p><b>[On Melaka United FC]</b> Of course we could see that Melaka are a good side. They simply dominated the first half. I think they are one of the best teams at the moment as they have good players. But at the same time, after we made some changes, I think we managed to get back in the game and create better chances to finally score the equaliser. After that, we also created several more chances to score. Regardless, of course it’s a good result for Selangor to collect one point. Once again I want to say that Melaka are one of the best teams and they have quality players. You could see that for yourselves.<br /><br />The introduction of Astafei at the beginning of the second half certainly changed the game. But I could see that Francis Doe still needs to work on his fitness because he previously lack practice time. The fitness is there but it still needs improving. Another of our new import players, Juliano Mineiro <b>[Brazil-born Timor Leste player]</b> has been registered. But he was not in the squad tonight because we want to prepare him ahead of our next match, against PKNS FC on Saturday. We are still monitoring his fitness. If it is good, there’s a good chance he will be picked for the first time<br /><br />Of course for young players, it’s not easy for them to perform <b>[at the senior level]</b>, but I think Adam <b>[forward Adam Nor Azlin]</b> and Syahmi <b>[winger Syahmi Safari]</b> gave their best, and Kannan <b>[defender Kannan Kalaiselvan]</b> as well came on and took the team to another level. Of course we have these players so we have to work with them, and I believe with them in the squad, we can do a good job</p>

The only thing that we didn’t do was score goals.<br /><br />With our performance today, we shouldn’t have been dragged into the penalty shootout. And when it’s penalty, it’s <b>[down to]</b> luck, the team with luck will qualify. I think Negeri Sembilan had luck, so they went through. My players gave their best, we could see they gave their all, tried to find the back of the net, only they failed to do so<br /><br />It’s not easy for the players to convert a penalty, because they’ve played the 90 minutes as well as the extra-time. They have to concentrate but they are already tired. It <b>[failure to convert penalties]</b> happens, so we have to accept it, and start focusing on the next match. We have only this set of players, so we need to give them a chance, motivate them, instill positive thoughts, and work on them during training so they can improve</p>

The players seemed a little fatigued even though they tried to give their best. But we failed to control the game and instead it was T-Team who were able to play better.

  <p><b>[Selangor boss P Maniam wants rising star Syahmi Safari to focus on fulfilling his potential]</b> I’m very happy with Syahmi, he’s just 19-years old but his contribution was superb. We were effective on the right wing, his crossing was dangerous and he scored two goals. He needs to forget this game and focus on the next one. That’s most important for him, as a player<br /><br />Of course Adam and Syahmi have been playing in the first eleven <b>[for Selangor]</b>, so their departure will definitely impact us. But it’s for national team duty and we have to let them go, and I think they also deserve to play for the national team. At the same time we have other options such as Nama <b>[20-year old winger Arunasalam Namathevan]</b>. He’s not mature enough to play at the same level as Syahmi, but if given the chance I think he will improve</p>

  <p><b>[On 4-2 win at home against T-Team]</b> In the first half we created two or three chances but we lacked the finishing. But we began the second half more strongly, and played positively especially in the attacking third. We created chances and put them away, but our defending was a little lacking. We need to work on this. I think our players especially Amri <b>[Yahyah]</b>, Rufino, and the more senior players did very well.<br /><br />The younger players did well too, such as Adam <b>[Nor Azlin]</b> who played in his new position as a centre back effectively. Syahmi also scored two goals, and his confidence level should grow after the game. We will do well in the Malaysia Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor boss P Maniam has defended centre back Ugo Ukah, after the Nigerian conceded his second penalty in the space of four days]</b> He played well, but sometimes these things <b>[mistakes]</b> happen in those situations. But he has experience so he’s got to learn a lesson and avoid repeating it in the next games<br /><br />We had a good game, created a lot of chances, our possession was good, we were dangerous when attacking. <b>[But]</b> the final product was not there, and we have to improve on this</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor’s negative approach against Kedah on Saturday frustrated many, but the Red Giants boss P Maniam insists that it was borne out of necessity]</b> Rufino got injured, and that’s why we could not play more attacking football. Throughout the match, we had to play a negative, defensive game, but our target was to collect one point.<br /><br />We came here aiming for a draw, but if Amri, Andik and Rufino were there, we would have gone for the win.<br /><br />Next we’ll be playing against JDT in the Malaysia Cup. Amri, Andik and Razman will return so I will be able to rotate the players</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor head coach P Maniam praised two-goal Amri Yahyah after their 3-2 win over JDT]</b> I think nobody expected the result, it seems that everybody <b>[the reporters in the room]</b> is still shocked that we won 3-2!<br /><br />In the first half we played well, we created a lot of chances and looked better. But after leading 2-0 we defended too deeply, in the second half we did not really control the game. JDT made changes and played well, they managed to equalise. With some luck and determination by my players we got the winning penalty, and we deserve to win<br /><br />Amri is an ex-player who came back, he’s a legend. He did a lot and he scored two goals, when he plays he inspires other players. They are motivated because of Amri. Amri inspires his teammates<br /><br />I must give credit to the reserve players, they haven’t been playing in four or five matches, but when I picked them they gave their best. Although they only played for 60, 70 minutes, they never stopped running, they concentrated, they played with heart</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor now more familiar with P Maniam’s tactics]</b> It’s the players’ mindset. They are more confident with the style of play, and they believe in themselves. Not only in themselves, but also in their teammates. They work hard together; the more senior players guide the younger ones and we can see that the team spirit is there.<br /><br />We’ve been through seven games <b>[in July]</b>, the players are fatigued and what they need now is some rest and recovery. Even Andik <b>[Indonesian winger Andik Vermansah]</b> is injured. He only came on in the last 25 minutes, and even then he could not press intensely. But overall I am happy with the result<br /><br />In the first half we played well even without Rufino <b>[Spanish striker Rufino Segovia]</b> and Andik. We led by one goal and created two, three more chances, but we just did not convert them. And in the second half we defended more and avoided conceding, which was our objective today. My men did my job well, not just one or two but all eleven of them worked hard on defending</p>

  <p><b>[After defeat to Felda, Selangor maybe without three star forwards against Terengganu]</b> My men were very tired and fatigued, but they tried their best to keep up. However, the opponents scored two from set-piece situations when the marking was poor. In the first half we did not create many chances, but after making some changes at the start of the second half, in the first 20, 30 minutes we managed to create more chances. But ultimately they were tired, and that was the one thing lacking with Selangor tonight.<br /><br />Amri Yahyah has hurt his hamstring tonight, I don’t think he can start against Terengganu. I hope Rufo <b>[Rufino Segovia]</b> and Andik <b>[Vermansah]</b> can recover on time to play in the match. At the same time the rest of my players are already exhausted so I may rotate one or two players, but I think we can do well in Kuala Terengganu</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor are set to take on Terengganu in their Group D Malaysia Cup match on Saturday with only one foreign player in the starting line-up]</b> They <b>[Andik and Rufino]</b> are not starting, but maybe they’ll play in the second half. Only Doe is starting and we’ve given Ukah a rest. Tonight is the local boys’ chance to shine especially the young boys like Kannan <b>[Kalaiselvan]</b>, Syahmi <b>[Safari]</b>, Adam <b>[Nor Azlin]</b> and Nama <b>[Namathevan Arunasalam]</b>,.<br /><br />In that match two of the opponents’ goals were scored from set piece situations, while one came from our mistake. Tonight my players have to avoid repeating the same mistakes, avoid conceding, and we must be compact</p>
