  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk can take Liverpool to the next level]</b> They sold <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho to Barcelona for a huge fee, £146m, and have brought in Virgil van Dijk for £75m - a player they badly needed. Ultimately, they needed a centre-back more than they needed Coutinho. If they can get Van Dijk to the level they’re hoping they can get him to and he can be the leader they need in that defence, then he can elevate them to the next level. And then, next season, they can look to compete with Manchester City. Given Liverpool’s strength in attack and weaknesses at the back, it looks like it has been a great trade for them. The next position on Jurgen Klopp’s list to address will be a goalkeeper - but I think that will have to wait until the summer. Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius are both good goalkeepers but you just have to look at Ederson at Manchester City to see what a difference a top goalkeeper can make to a team. Last season Claudio Bravo was shaky, nervous. But while Ederson makes the odd mistake, such as his misplaced kick last weekend, he’s been brilliant for City. The problem Liverpool have is it isn’t easy to find a keeper of that calibre. It’s easier to scout an outfield player than a goalkeeper at times. So I expect them to wait until the summer before they make a move for that role.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City has helped Raheem Sterling develop into the ideal No.10 for England]</b> For years now, I have bemoaned the lack of English No.10s coming through the ranks. You look at Spain and the names trip off the tongue: Andres Iniesta, Cesc Fabregas, Isco, David Silva. There is a conveyor belt of Spanish creative geniuses. In Raheem Sterling, however, England may finally have the closest thing to a master manipulator on the ball. Sterling starts wide on the right for Manchester City but in England’s friendlies last week he was the perfect 10. He oozed class as he strolled around the Wembley turf against Italy - linking the play, putting people through, driving England forwards. International football is often tense and cagey but Sterling allowed England to breathe in possession.<br /><br />Had Pep Guardiola not come into his life, I do not believe any of this would have happened. Last season, Sterling was simply a good player. He was in and out of the team and did not know his best position. Thierry Henry speaks about what an education he had under Guardiola in his three seasons at Barcelona. The City manager has worked his magic on Sterling, transforming him into one of the most serious footballers around</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will need to find a suitable replacement for Philippe Coutinho in the summer transfer]</b> While they have brushed aside Manchester City and Roma in the Champions League without him, against the smaller teams they have lacked a player of his quality who can unlock the door. Liverpool are most dangerous when their opponents have the ball. One mistake and their fearsome forward line pounces. When teams drop deep and defend - as Stoke did on Saturday as they battled to a 0-0 draw - Klopp’s team struggle to make the breakthrough. Coutinho has that ability to unpick a defence with a killer pass. He could have turned one point into three. That is what Liverpool need to seriously challenge Manchester City for the title next season</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Redknapp has defended Sergio Ramos following the Champions League final controversy]</b> His record in terms of getting sent off is not the best but I would have him in my team. Whether you like him or not, he plays on the edge. But look at his record. He’s made the most out of his ability. Go and take a look at his trophy cabinet. He’s won everything. He’s a winner. If Virgil van Dijk had done it at the other end, if he had injured Ronaldo, would Liverpool fans have been complaining? That’s just football sometimes, it’s not the best thing in the world but that’s how it is. Someone’s got to win at all costs.<br /><br />I think they can challenge but Manchester City are going to take some beating and that’s the problem for everybody. They need a goalkeeper, that goes without saying. The situation with Karius is a sad one for the kid. I don’t know how he comes back from what happened in the final. Does he play for Liverpool again? In terms of the defence, they have Van Dijk who is a fantastic player. He’s been a brilliant signing. In midfield there is going to be a lot of competition for places now with Keita and Fabinho being brought in. Maybe they need another wideman, just to give a different option sometimes. So they are not far away. With the two they’ve signed, I think Liverpool are going to go close</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane is England’s answer to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He is our Messi, our Ronaldo. He is the talisman, the person we will be looking at to score and to make that difference. He is leading by example. He is the player that everyone is talking about - wherever you go at the moment, people from all around the world. He has gone to another level and elevated his game. Not only that but as a person and everyone thinks he is one of the best players in the world now - he is in the top five and things can only get better.<br /><br /><b>[On Gareth Southgate]</b> They have played with no fear and I always think that has been a major problem with England in the World Cups and European Championships the last three or four campaigns. You can see the players have been transfixed by fear, it has almost taken over them, and that has sometimes come from the top. When you go into the games, how you portray the team - if you are so worried about the press - that is only going to transmit to the players. Gareth has said ‘we are going to embrace this, enjoy it, play’ and hopefully they carry on doing this because at the moment, and I think I speak for everybody when I say this, the whole country has fallen in love with England again. We have an unbelievable opportunity to do something very special. I look at that squad and I get really jealous and think I would love to be in that squad. It looks like it is great fun, they are all playing for each other, with freedom and that is the greatest compliment I could give them. That is what Gareth Southgate has created so far</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s transfer business earns Redknapp approval]</b> What I like about Liverpool is that they’ve addressed problems. He hasn’t messed around. He knew he had to get a goalkeeper and he did it early. Of course you want to win something and there’s pressure every single year as a manager. You only need one or two bad seasons and it’s all over. I like this pressure Klopp is under and they look like contenders. There is a pressure to a certain extent but it’s a positive pressure. There’s no point in going into a season not thinking you can win, being unhappy and moaning, having a poor pre-season - a bit like what’s happening at Manchester United. In Klopp, I’m looking at a manager who fancies his chances this year. They did a number on Man City in three of the four games they played and they’ve got a goalkeeper. If you look at the difference a goalkeeper made for Man City last season and now for Liverpool to get Alisson - yes you paid top dollar for him - but he’ll make a huge difference.<br /><br />In defence, he knew he needed to strengthen and bought the best in Virgil van Dijk. He cost £70 million, but I reckon you could sell him for a lot more than that now. He’s been brilliant for that back four, he’s made everyone look better. Liverpool will concede goals because it’s a consequence of how they play, but I’d rather have that type of football - that’s what you want to see. With the players they’ve bought in, I don’t know what else they could have done. They always seem to buy players and Klopp turns them into stars and match winners and players that will be worth so much more than they already are</p>

  <p><b>[Not one Arsenal player would make it into Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea side]</b> Arsenal may have shown fight to battle back against Chelsea but their 3-2 loss only papers over the cracks. Looking at the Arsenal team, not one of their players would get in Maurizio Sarri’s best XI. At the heart of defence, Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis don’t look a partnership. At full back, Cesar Azpilicueta is both more solid defensively and more creative in attack than Hector Bellerin while Marcos Alonso has been impressive since his debut in 2016. Kepa Arrizabalaga could have done better with Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s first goal but I would rather have a young goalkeeper who is confident playing out from the back than Petr Cech, who is struggling. There was no contest between the two midfield enforcers.</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp must cut out costly draws]</b> Manchester City are the outstanding favourites still, of course. They’re a fantastic side and I feel like they will still come out on top. But Liverpool are in contention. There’s a lot of talk about them having to make up a 25-point deficit on Man City from last year but remember Man City had to make up a big deficit on Chelsea from the season before. The challenge for Liverpool will be ensuring they don’t throw away points needlessly. Loris Karius has obviously received a lot of criticism - and Alisson will improve them - but you can’t hold the goalkeeper accountable for 0-0 draws at home to the likes of Stoke and West Brom, who both went on to be relegated. They had seven draws at home last season and they need to find a way to edge those close games if they are really going to push City. At times Liverpool play such good football and it feels like they’re looking for the perfect goal - but often it’s the ugly goals that are the crucial ones, earning you those scruffy three points when you haven’t been on top form.<br /><br />Klopp will just need to maintain that happy balance in the squad. It’s one of the challenges of having talented players on the bench. Yes, it’s all smiles at the start of the season but after 25 games that good feeling wears off a little bit if you’ve been sat on the bench for most of the time. That was something Pep Guardiola did well at City last year, keeping all of his squad happy and feeling involved in the success. Football is about squads these days and you need everyone ready to step in when required</p>

  <p><b>[The rift between Jose Mourinho and Paul Pogba at Manchester United could culminate in both player and manager leaving Old Trafford]</b> It’s not helpful. It’s a loaded answer. I get it, I do get it and I’m sure it’s something the players talk about in the dressing room. But I don’t think it helps. Don’t say it to the press, say it to the manager. The truth is, after he won the World Cup, he’s not had a rest. It’s an ideal chance to give him a rest tonight. The fact he isn’t playing tonight shouldn’t be untoward. I don’t think they will both be here next year - maybe neither!.<br /><br />I don’t think they are getting the best out of Pogba but he has to do more himself. Modern players need to look in the mirror but the manager has to take responsibility. Jurgen Klopp gets the best out of his players, Pep Guardiola gets the best from his players, but there is a lot of wasted talent here</p>

To be the only Premier League team not to sign a single player in the summer did not make any sense at all. No team is perfect, so why would Tottenham be any different? They have got to be careful because they are so lucky to have Pochettino and every club in the world would want him. He has kept it all going and got them on a good run in the Premier League when other managers might have thrown in the towel. Spurs don’t want a situation where they have an unsettled, unhappy manager , because if he was to go, that would be an opportunity for a lot of the players to go as well.<br /><br />There is a lot of negativity around the club now which is not needed.

They should be. This exciting young team are showing them how it should be done. The likes of Sven Goran Eriksson, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson had stronger squads at their disposal but the progress under Southgate has only highlighted how much those England sides underachieved. Players are being picked on form, not reputation. It doesn’t matter who you play for - if you’re good enough, you have a chance. This approach has allowed Ben Chilwell, Joe Gomez, Ross Barkley and Jadon Sancho to break into a team who reached the World Cup semi-finals.<br /><br />What pleased me most about Sunday’s win <b>[over Croatia]</b> is that it finally put to bed the nonsense that England fluked their way to the last four in Russia.

Failing to make it through would not only be a significant blow to their confidence but could also mean they are playing Europa League football. Playing on Thursday then Sunday is gruelling and it means you are more likely to have to play catch-up in the Premier League. It would threaten to derail their title push.<br /><br />Despite making their best start to a top-flight season, Liverpool are still only a point clear at the top. Ten years ago, Rafa Benitez was in the same position as Jurgen Klopp now - one point clear after 16 games - only to finish second to United. In 2014 Liverpool were in the driving seat with three games to go but could not get over the line. We will only find out if this current group have what it takes if they are still leading as the season enters the final straight.

Tottenham have got to do everything in their power to keep him, it’s as simple as that. He’s a very talented manager, the players adore him and play for him and you can see why Manchester United would want him<br /><br />It is all there for him, moving into a new stadium, a great young side and if he was to move it would be a real shame for Tottenham. But I’m sure, knowing Daniel Levy, he will think ‘where is the next one, who is the next manager that could take this club forward?’ He will know there are people out there. There are not many like Pochettino but I would say someone like Eddie Howe would be the perfect fit for Tottenham; he gives young players an opportunity. So I don’t think it will be the end of the world but it will be a huge blow because it will give a lot of players the opportunity to say ‘if he’s gone we might want to go as well’. They have to keep him, it’s as simple as that. Tottenham have let a lot of their best players go in the last 20 years but they can’t let their best manager go because he’s a special talent. It would show a lack of ambition if they did let him go</p>

But spending power alone is not why Liverpool lead the Premier League by six points at the season’s halfway stage. Manchester United have spent nearly £200m more than Klopp over the last three seasons and at no point have they looked like title contenders.<br /><br />The Liverpool team who thrashed Benitez’s Newcastle 4-0 included an academy graduate, Trent Alexander-Arnold, an £8m left back, Andrew Robertson and Xherdan Shaqiri who - at £13m from Stoke - is proving to be one of the bargains of the summer. Klopp is a manager who not only has an eye for a good player but improves them, too. Mohamed Salah was not a 40-goal forward and a contender for the Ballon d’Or when he arrived at the club. Joe Gomez has been transformed into a first-choice centre half for England, a player who before his injury was keeping a World Cup finalist in Dejan Lovren out of the Liverpool team. Having left the comfort zone at Arsenal last season, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked a certainty for England’s World Cup squad before damaging knee ligaments in the Champions League semi-finals. What is even more remarkable about Liverpool’s continued development under Klopp is that it has not been curtailed by the loss of their world-class playmaker, Philippe Coutinho.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has been the outstanding player of the 2018-19 season]</b> No one comes close to Virgil van Dijk. He has transformed Liverpool into a rock-solid team who are favourites to win their first league title for 29 years. His team-mate and reigning player of the year Mo Salah must fancy his chances of defending the crown. He has followed up a record-breaking first season at Anfield by topping the scoring charts with 16 goals.<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Kane]</b> Kane remains Spurs’ most important player. His goals have been worth six points to Spurs - more than any player - and his late strikes against PSV salvaged their Champions League campaign<br /><br /><b>[On Son Heung-Min]</b> His workrate cannot be questioned. Son made more sprints than any player on the pitch in both of Spurs’ games last week despite having recently flown back from the Asian Cup with South Korea. He has stepped up and become a key player for Mauricio Pochettino. It is to his immense credit that he is being talked about as a player of the year contender. While Son is making a convincing case, he doesn’t quite get into my six-man shortlist</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham have been warned by Jamie Redknapp that Borussia Dortmund will smell blood]</b> Tottenham may have won the first leg 3-0 but their Champions League tie with Dortmund is far from over - especially if they concede early on Tuesday. We had a similar situation at Liverpool in 1997 when we went into a Cup-Winners’ Cup semi-final second leg at Anfield trailing PSG 3-0. Robbie Fowler scored after 12 minutes and from then on it was a different tie. PSG cracked under the pressure and, though we could only win 2-0 on the night, by the end they were clinging on. Dortmund will have seen Spurs’ recent slump. Christian Eriksen looks exhausted and, without Harry Winks against Arsenal, they were unable to control the midfield. Roared on by the Yellow Wall, Dortmund will be smelling blood. Spurs cannot simply try to see out this tie. Sit back and they will only invite a Dortmund onslaught.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s decision not to announce <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> as their new permanent manager suggests that Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino remains in the frame]</b> Timing is everything in football. Manchester United had the perfect opportunity to announce <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> as their permanent manager. It was the morning after their sensational victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League when their interim manager’s stock could not have been higher. Instead, they held off. What are they waiting for? Are the club still to be convinced that he is their man? <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has more than exceeded expectations, propelling United into contention for the top four and getting them through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League against all odds. He has made a group of players who were performing well below par look like the multimillion-pound assets they truly are. He clearly has the support of his players, many of whom have gone on the record saying he should be appointed full-time. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> will feel he has more than proved himself but the longer United wait, the greater the risk that the feel-good factor begins to fade.<br /><br />Matters have been complicated by the return of Zinedine Zidane to Real Madrid. Now that door has closed to Mauricio Pochettino, United are in pole position to try to tempt him away from Tottenham. Pochettino was the No 1 candidate to replace Jose Mourinho. He has an outstanding track record when it comes to improving players and has established Spurs as a top-four side, despite having his hands tied in the last two transfer windows. Regardless of Tottenham’s recent poor run of form, he remains the strongest candidate and would become an even more attractive option should United’s season not finish on a high. Whatever happens between now and May, <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s reputation as a manager has been significantly enhanced. Whether he is sitting in the Old Trafford dugout next season, though, may depend on his ability to deliver Champions League football</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Redknapp has also saluted Sancho’s rapid development]</b> His double nutmeg was outrageous. I made my international debut in September 1995 in a 0-0 draw with Colombia at Wembley and I was involved in a spot of showboating too, albeit by accident. I chipped the ball towards the goal and Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita saved it with a scorpion kick, so I don’t think anything will beat that. Sancho is an example of what kids are being taught in academies up and down the country. Kids these days are coached to be able to play with both feet and express themselves.

Not only has Van Dijk done that but he has completely transformed this team. He is a leader, an organiser and a calming presence rolled into one.

Not for the first time, he stood up and did his job, taking his club a step closer to their first title for 30 years. It is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s to lose</p>

And yet, amid all this, their No.9, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, has not scored a single goal at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in 2019-20. How remarkable is that?<br /><br /><a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> have contributed 16 and 10 in all competitions by comparison, and this highlights two things. It shows the way <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions elect use <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> as a link-up man and also the importance of the modern-day winger’s ability to get goals and assists<br /><br /><a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> comes short for the ball, creates space for others, connects attacks and creates opportunities for his team-mates who love to come inside. They don’t stay stranded out wide, and we saw that against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday. Mane won possession centrally off Jack Simpson before playing the ball to <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, who made up for a poor pass by scoring anyway to make it 1-1. For the winner, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> made an interception on the halfway line and played a through-ball into Mane, who was central again. He then beat Aaron Ramsdale from the one on one. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will recognise the job that <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is doing, too, even if he isn’t the one banging in the goals at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> himself. The Brazilian is the modern No.9 - selfless, and not purely relied upon for scoring. He is the focal point of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s 4-3-3 system</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> was referring to a clash between <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> in which the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> striker struck the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender with a flailing boot just above the eye]</b> I can see what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is saying because it looks really dangerous and he caught him in the face with his studs.

It looks really nasty. VAR have obviously looked at it and thought he hasn’t meant to do it. When you play football you see legs, you see bodies, but I don’t think I’ve ever played with a player who wants to kick a player in the face, that doesn’t really enter your mind. I’d like to think <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> wouldn’t mean that. But I can see what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is saying because it looks really dangerous and he’s caught <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> in the face with his studs</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Redknapp saw an improvement in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> from their goalless draw with <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> It was <b>[a better performance]</b> to a certain extent. It was a performance of a team struggling for a little bit of confidence, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had the ball for long periods and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> had to play on the counter-attack, but at least they looked dangerous. They just looked like a bit more of an attacking threat. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s back three will always give you a chance. It’s a fact. They’re defending better but they can’t help it, it’s in their DNA right now<br /><br />But for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, it was all about getting three points. There was some moments that went their way but they looked dangerous enough and you thought something might go their way and it’s a brilliant header from <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a>. That’s what leaders do and you need people like him to stand up when you have a difficult period<br /><br />Jose masterclass! That’s what they call it, isn’t it?!</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Redknapp’s verdict on Daniel Podence at the break]</b> I’ve been so impressed with Podence, he is so exciting and the best player on the pitch, making things happen and always looking to get on the ball</p>
