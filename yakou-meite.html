  <p><b>[Reading forward Yakou Meite is hoping that USMNT defender Matt Miazga leaves Chelsea]</b> These last six months, he has brought us a lot of stability. He has a good mentality and of course we want him to stay. But we know it will be complicated. He is aggressive, he talks a lot to the players, and he is a warrior. He has the same state of mind as those who started the fight for keeping the team in Championship. He could say this relegation battle was nothing really serious for him because he will go back to his club, but he has the same goal as all of us</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba: <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> vows to take action after star targeted by racist abuse on social media]</b> The latest round of fixtures have seen unwarranted and vile racist abuse sent to players. This time Reading’s Yakou Meite and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. The number of posts such as these since the start of the season further highlights how discriminatory abuse online is out of control. Without immediate and the strongest possible action these cowardly acts will continue to grow</p>
