  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> midfielder Luis Alberto hopes <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> can resume in early June for his side to continue their title bid]</b> Now we believe in the Scudetto. We are there and we cannot deny being in the running to win it. I think we can start playing in early June, but it is difficult to give an exact date. It depends on the evolution of the virus. Hopefully everything will be done as soon as possible. I want to finish the championship. It would be right both for us who are at the top of the standings and for those who are fighting not to be relegated. And I am not saying this because we are in second place<br /><br /><b>[He has been linked with a return to boyhood club <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>]</b> I have always said that <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> is my home and that I would like to return. But now my future is in white and blue. We are well under way for the renewal, I believe it will come soon<br /><br />The season must be completed. The championship must go on out of respect for the dead and all the fans. The time is not yet ripe to decide on the cancellation. The number of infected people is decreasing and interrupting the season would be unfair. For Italian football, stopping here would be a disaster. We will try to prevent this from happening with all our strength. In Italian football over 75 per cent of clubs finance their budget through TV rights, if these revenues were not there, it would come to collapse</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Alberto thriving at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> after <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> struggle]</b> I wasn’t mature enough at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and made the step up in quality quite late in the day. I didn’t get the playing time I wanted at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, then I started well at <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> and was enjoying my football at Deportivo when I got injured. I made the big step up at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>, a wonderful club. Joining <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> was the best decision of my life. Nobody really knew me and that was my fault. I was training by myself at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but changed mentality with (coach Juan) Campillo and took that next step<br /><br />I always said <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> is my home and I’d like to return there, but my future is at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>, so that is practically impossible. Talks are at an advanced stage for a contract extension and I think it’ll come soon<br /><br />We get the feeling that we can return to training by the end of the month, even if just in small groups. It is slowly calming down, although the situation was never as bad in Rome as in the north. I want to complete the season, as it would be the right thing for those at the top and bottom of the table. The timing all depends on how the virus evolves</p>
