  <p><b>[Cherno Samba, who despite being an unheralded teenager at Millwall, was one of the best players on the video game now known as Football Manager]</b> I had to order a new phone from my network provider. I rang them up to get it ordered and was told to wait two to three months for it to arrive. I thought, ‘No problem’. The guy then asked my name and I said, ‘Cherno Samba’. With surprise, he asked, ‘The one from Championship Manager? You’ll get it the next day’</p>

  <p><b>[What ever happened to Cherno Samba?]</b> It was electric, I’ll never forget it; all my mates were on the bus, they didn’t believe me! I had to put him on loudspeaker. I was saying, ‘I’m talking to Michael Owen, come on, be quiet!’ Everyone was just going absolutely mad and he was just going ‘you’re a good player’ and giving me advice, and when I came off the phone everyone was just jumping on me, shouting, ‘Oh my God, Michael Owen just called my mate, bruv!’. It was something I’ll always cherish. They were really good times back then!.<br /><br />It was Man United, Liverpool, Leeds and Arsenal that were interested and I went to all four clubs and, funnily enough, while I’m a United fan, I ended up loving Liverpool because when I went there, they made me feel very welcome and it was more of a family club. I just felt comfortable. Michael really helped me, he called me and said ‘You know, it’d be nice if you came here, we can play together’ and then that just sold the club to me and Gerard Houllier at the time was great, absolutely legendary, he made me feel very welcome<br /><br />They put a bid in and obviously things didn’t work out because Millwall didn’t want me to go. They couldn’t agree payments or whatever, and then that’s why the deal collapsed<br /><br />When I went back to Liverpool I spoke to Owen, I was in the changing room with them, with Robbie Fowler and Emile Heskey as well, so I remember one incident. We were sitting in there and Heskey said to me, ‘It’d be good for you to come and play with us’ and I agreed. And he goes ‘Just make sure when you come, you don’t take my place!’. And I told him ‘I will be taking your place, I want to be playing!’ It was tongue-in-cheek, at that age, so it was all good, it was banter, and I loved that<br /><br />It’s just obviously people who don’t know football. That’s why they overlook it. But people in the game, people that know football, I don’t think they overlook it, nor do the fans. It can be more singing praises to see what I’ve achieved and what I’ve done. It’s like the record I’ve still got; I took from Michael Owen when I was a schoolboy. It’s a big achievement. It can be overlooked sometimes and I don’t think it should be<br /><br /><b>[He believes his experiences can serve as a warning to the youngsters he is now coaching at Spurs]</b> I’ve been around so long, the reason for that is because I blew up really early, that’s all it is. I haven’t got any regrets, bar one. I wish I’d trained better and worked harder because it was my own fault. I was far above everyone else. If we had to do 10 training drills, I’d do five. And if we had to do weights, I’d do a few, I wouldn’t push myself as hard as I should have done because I believed I was better than everyone else. Part of it, I’ll take the blame for it. I’m a better person to help the next generation now<br /><br />At the end of the day you have your own mind and mental strength so things like that shouldn’t really affect you if you really want to gain something in the game or whatever. However, being young, at that time, yes, because you’re not mature enough, they get in your head. And then the pressure comes to you. People look at you - ‘He’s the best in the game, he’s the best in real life, he’s the best in the world’ - so therefore you always have to live on that status<br /><br />My ultimate dream is to one day manage the Gambian National Team to the African Cup of Nations or the World Cup qualifiers and hopefully get in because Gambia has never qualified for either tournament. It’d be a dream to do that for them</p>

  <p><b>[Cherno Samba has savaged England’s youth system for failing young players, and has called for a cap on their wages]</b> I can sit down and say this now because people can say ‘when you were younger, you were earning all this money so why didn’t you say it then?’ I understand that, I wish I knew then what I know now because I would have wanted a wage cap. When I was in Spain, the people at my age were earning €3,000 a month, and they were playing in the first-team, week in, week out. I was earning crazy money back then. I left England to go there so they had to make me feel good, whereas here, at a young age, at 17, I went and bought a brand new Peugeot, 11 grand, cash. I went to the showroom, I want an eleven grand car, crazy, at 17-years-old. That is wrong.<br /><br />Looking at it now, I know that is wrong. And this is the problem. By the time I was 21, 22, the football’s out of the way, I was just thinking about the money and how I look good, got a nice house, nice car, that’s it. And this is why we are suffering. There should be a wage cap. It’s never going to happen, because football has gone to another level now with money but it’s sad. It’s really sad<br /><br />We hype our youngsters so much and what annoys me is that as soon as they have a bad game, or one or two bad games, they just put them all the way up in the sky and then drag them right down to the bottom and that’s what hurts me most. You go to any country, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, they’re not like that. They help their players, and that’s why they produce players week in, week out and they do well in tournaments, whereas we hype our youngsters that by the time we’ve reached our potential, we’re nobody again. That’s because we do get too much hype. It’s like the other day, I was talking to one of my mates, and I’ve got this picture of the England Under-17s and when I showed him, we saw there are only three of us still in the game; me, Wayne Rooney and Wayne Routledge. Everyone else disappeared, you don’t even hear about them, they’re not in football anymore. So that says a lot and there were players in that picture who were unbelievably talented. But they were hyped and it’s too much. We’re overhyped, it doesn’t help<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the way he was portrayed in the media as a teenager]</b> I could get away with murder. I couldn’t do anything wrong, but those people weren’t helping me. Because I was young, if anyone were to criticise me, I would say ‘no’ and just abandon them, because they were nobody, I didn’t want to know anything about them. But the people that were praising me, I wanted them around me, so anyone that gave me bad, negative vibes I didn’t want to be around those people. So you’ve got to be grounded, you’ve got to say ‘yep, well done Cherno, that’s good. Carry on.’ Not, ‘bloody hell Cherno, you’re amazing, you’ve made it, you’ve done it’, that’s not helping me, and in the media too, with ‘Cherno’s this’ and ‘Cherno’s that’. That’s not helping me, and this is what we do to our kids, and this is what we do to our young players, we hype them up<br /><br /><b>[Referencing England’s Under-17 team, which won the World Cup]</b> Spain wins those sorts of tournaments all the time. They talk about it for one day, two days, then it’s done with, forgotten, you don’t even hear about it, whereas here, we go on about it and go on about it and go on about it. We tell people, he’s going to be in the first team, he’s going to be this and that, next minute, they don’t. This is what happens. A lot of people don’t realise the pressures we face as young players. It’s a lot. It’s unbelievable, and I think we need to protect a lot of youngsters.</p>
