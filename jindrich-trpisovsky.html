  <p><b>[Sevilla (6-5 after extra-time)]</b> It was a marvellous and magical night. To score the winner against such a strong team in the dying minutes of extra time: what more could we wish for? This may not happen again in my life</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea vs Slavia Prague]</b> I am very impressed by Chelsea. We were really stunned and the whole environment here, and this is a great experience. The quality is just unreal, it’s like being on a different planet. Obviously, we don’t have that in the Czech Republic. I am very grateful that we can be here, and that we’re playing here. We’re going to war tomorrow, so we’ve got to be ready.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard]</b> I think currently he’s the best player in the world. And I’d love for him to play tomorrow. If he plays tomorrow that means Chelsea take us seriously</p>

  <p><b>[Slavia Prague Coach Jindrich Trpisovsky assess <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a> becoming one of the best in the world in his position in the near future]</b> I knew about <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a>’s quality before. I think that, within a few years, he will be among the three or four best full-backs in the world. His potential is tremendous</p>

  <p><b>[Bottom-placed Slavia exit the competition without a win but Slavia Prague coach Jindrich Trpisovsky was delighted with how his side equipped themselves in Germany]</b> My boys gave a performance that was worthy of the Champions League. I am proud that they showed such a display against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, who were playing for everything</p>
