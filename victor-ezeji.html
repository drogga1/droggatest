<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Victor Ezeji, a legend of the Nigeria Football League who won three caps for Nigeria, said he thought Drogba’s former team-mates didn’t vote for him out of jealousy]</b> First, I will attribute this to envy because most times, ex-internationals seem to envy <b>[each other]</b>. Especially when one is thriving, there is so much envy and bad blood. I think that is one of the things that must have led to <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> not getting a vote from any of the ex-internationals which is very absurd<br /><br />In most sane countries, you’ll see ex-internationals head their FAs because it’s like putting a round peg in a round hole. That was what everybody expected it <b>[the Ivorian election]</b> to be. Personally, I thought <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> would have a clean sweep because the ex-internationals were involved. Unfortunately, that did not happen<br /><br />Also, when it comes to elections generally in Africa, people tend to sell their votes for envelopes. <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> probably didn’t reach out to them or make mouth-watering promises. Like my friend would say, for you to know how popular you are, it is when you contest an election</p>
