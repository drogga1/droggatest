  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> bound for Perth? Australian city offers to host rest of season]</b> I have had discussions with contacts at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs and they like the idea. I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week. Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions. We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days.</p>

  <p><b>[Agent outlines bold plan to finish <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season in Perth]</b> We’ve got the venues, we’ve got the weather and we are in control of the coronavirus at the moment. You would need four facilities and the timing is absolutely brilliant, because we could kick off over here at 6pm, 8pm and 10pm. And 10pm kick off here would be 3pm in the afternoon there and we’d also have coverage worldwide all through Asia and America. Timing wise this is the ideal place and also health and safety wise and facility wise, it’s the ideal place, Perth<br /><br />The players would have to be in isolation for two weeks <b>[travelling to Australia from the UK]</b>. After the two weeks, all the games would be televised with no crowds. We’d be looking at Optus <b>[Stadium]</b>, the WACA and probably <b>[HBF]</b> Arena. They could use local state league clubs to do the training</p>
