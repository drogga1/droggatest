<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brighton loanee Jurgen Locadia has claimed fans in the United States can sit back and enjoy matches more than they do in Europe]</b> The stadiums are way bigger than in Europe and I think the fans’ vibe is also different because I think here in the States the fans enjoy the game more and in Europe I get the feeling that people are more judgey about the game. Here in the States, they come to enjoy the game and see the players and drink beer. And in Europe it’s more like, we need to win and they’re gonna judge you. They don’t like when you play the ball back to the goalkeeper<br /><br />I like it here so far in Cincinnati and the league also. I talk with my agent also and he said at the end of the day it’s my decision, and I told him I’m happy here, so if we can figure something out with Brighton and Cincinnati, which I understand is going to be difficult, we can try and fix the situation because…Cincinnati’s gotta say if they’re gonna buy me or not and I think Brighton has some work in it also. But my agent called with Brighton already and they talked about the situation and hopefully they can work something out</p>
