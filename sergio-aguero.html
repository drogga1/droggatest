My plan is to stay here because City can measure up with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the likes.

We were at the AFA training complex. I got sat at the table with him, <b>[Ezequiel]</b> <a href="ezequiel-garay.html">Garay</a> and <b>[Lautaro]</b> Formica. I was sat beside him. I looked at him but I didn’t know who he was. They were talking about some football boots. Then Leo sad, ‘They’re from the USA’. So I started thinking, ‘Where’s this guy from?’ I couldn’t resist and I asked him, ‘What’s your name?’ He said ‘Leo’ and I asked, ‘And what’s your surname?’ He said ‘Messi’ but it didn’t mean anything to me. I asked him again to see if it sounded familiar, and he again said ‘Messi’. He laughed and then we all laughed. Later I was thinking and I remembered that there was this kid everyone was talking about, who arrived at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when he was 12.

  <p><b>[Aguero on the goal which made him <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s record scorer]</b> I knew that by scoring one goal I would become the club’s all-time goal-scorer. The atmosphere was great, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> supporters were pushing really hard and it was beautiful, but at the same time I knew that the game was going to be tough. Obviously, I didn’t know I was going to score, but I tried until I got it. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> came close to scoring a third but <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> saved it and then we scored on the counter attack. When Leroy got the ball I thought ‘ciao!’, but then he fell down, and the ball just came to me, and that was beautiful! I had very clear idea that I wanted to put the ball in the bottom corner, just inside the post. The goal was beautiful; I just had broken the record. That was a fantastic night. Destiny wanted me to score it. If you watch it again, Leroy falls down and the ball could have gone to Kevin or anywhere else, but it came to me. I was happy because of the goal and it was a nice one too!</p>

With all this, the clubs are having problems. Up until next year, it can be extended for two months or more. There are players who end contracts this year and if it is played in July, August or September, the clubs are going to have problems. I don’t know if they can renew with players for three months or six. The first thing is to end this season and hit everything next</p>

  <p><b>[Aguero won’t rule out return to Spain as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> deal ticks down]</b> It’s difficult; I’m not thinking about what am I going to do. I know that every day my contract is closer to expiring. Probably there will be some offers but we’ll see. For now I just want to try to win the Champions League with City. That would be an incredible achievement for me and the club. But I haven’t really thought about what I will do after 2021. Also the current landscape makes things more difficult. If next season starts later, it will probably end later - maybe in August, something like that. And a lot of players have their contracts expiring in June - we’ll have to see how everything is sorted out. If contracts are prolonged I don’t know, we’ll see how it goes. I don’t rule out going back to Spain, or going to any country. I don’t know what I will do. Today I feel good and comfortable in Manchester. I want to do everything in the club in the best terms, then we’ll see<br /><br />We would like to play the second leg against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with people in the stands, for sure. It’s beautiful to see the crowd and the atmosphere, but if it’s played without fans it will be for the best for everyone. We took a good result from the Bernabeu. Obviously it won’t be easy, we’re talking about <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and we know that the game is not finished. We’ll have to be as focused as we were in Madrid. The thing now is to know if it will be possible to play. See if the competitions can be finished and decide the trophy winners. It would feel weird for everyone to decide who wins a trophy without playing all the games</p>

Leo at some point said something about the United States. I watched a lot of football, but from Argentina, not Europe. I asked Leo, ‘what was your name?’ ‘Lionel’, he replied and burst out laughing. And I say, ‘what about your last name?’. ‘Messi’, he answered. And the others asked me, ‘don’t you know who he is?’ I knew from the news there was a talented kid from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I said, ‘this is him’.

  <p><b>[Aguero hails <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender as one of the best]</b> We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He’s strong, tall, has an incredible body. He’s very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs. It looks like he isn’t fast but he is, because of his long legs - he can reach everywhere. Two steps from him are 50 for me! What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending. He’s not anxious when marking, he’s very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers. In my case, I’m pretty fast and I like to dribble, so I need the defender to come. But if he holds he can wait for help from another defender. He’s very good at thisve any symptoms but still infect you. That’s why I am here at home. Maybe I have the illness and I don’t even know</p>
