  <p>[On Raheem Sterling] Raheem deserves support from his fellow pros, he has taken a big stand and done a very brave thing. It would be great if some other players would support him and have the belief and confidence to go out and be themselves. But in England, black players are still afraid to speak out because they don’t want to be so-called ‘blacklisted’</p>

  <p>[His former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> team-mate Nigel Reo-Coker says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> full-back <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a> should definitely be named captain] I think that he should definitely be named captain; he’s done well. I think what United fans need to understand and be realistic with is that they’re not the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> of old, it’s a time for a change and the changing of the guard. I know Youngy is very passionate about winning and he’s always been a winner from times at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and even times at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and I think that’s the type of character that you need. I think that he has been unfairly criticised at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but he knows what it is, he can take it; he’s a very strong man. He’s a strong personality, he’s mentally strong and you have to be at that club and play at that level and I think that’s definitely the type of player that you need. Someone that has played in England, has played for the national team, someone that has been there and done that</p>
