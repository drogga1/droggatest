<blockquote>
  <p>[His former Aston Villa team-mate Nigel Reo-Coker says Manchester United full-back Ashley Young should definitely be named captain] I think that he should definitely be named captain; he’s done well. I think what United fans need to understand and be realistic with is that they’re not the Man Utd of old, it’s a time for a change and the changing of the guard. I know Youngy is very passionate about winning and he’s always been a winner from times at Aston Villa and even times at Watford and I think that’s the type of character that you need. I think that he has been unfairly criticised at Manchester United, but he knows what it is, he can take it; he’s a very strong man. He’s a strong personality, he’s mentally strong and you have to be at that club and play at that level and I think that’s definitely the type of player that you need. Someone that has played in England, has played for the national team, someone that has been there and done that</p>
