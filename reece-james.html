Chelsea full-back Reece James is set to remain at Stamford Bridge this season</p>

<p>: 2019 07 25
Frank Lampard’s decision to use academy graduate Reece James in his first-team plans next season could spell the end for Davide Zappacosta, who may find himself as the third-choice right-back</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James has admitted that playing at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was a dream come true]</b> Just to play my first game here at the Bridge, in front of all the fans, that was probably the best occasion. Obviously, it’s a dream come true. I’ve played for this club since I was seven years old and it’s always what I wanted. I’d played in front of a few crowds before but nothing like a full <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. I’m a little bit familiar with it but it was alright. I didn’t <b>[think about my goal celebration]</b>. Even if I did, I was just shocked at that moment. I’m just thankful I got the goal and we got the win. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> told me the day before but I think it doesn’t settle in until you’re actually out there on the pitch. The atmosphere was buzzing, the stadium, everyone was jumping. When I was young, I supported the club and still do now. I probably looked up to <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, Terry, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. They were the main three leaders. It helped drive the team back then when I was a little kid. They were all winners. That was reflected in the trophies they won<br /><br /><b>[James admits that he was not expecting to get his chance so soon, particularly given the club’s success under <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> last term]</b> At the time I wasn’t sure because the team did well last season, winning the Europa League. I decided to take it as it comes really and when I found out I was staying, I was obviously happy. I’m glad I’m getting my chance. If you look at the past few years there probably isn’t as many who have played. Out there today there were four or five of us that got on the pitch. That’s great for the academy. It shows the level and standard there is very good. Of course, looking at other young players getting a chance gives you a boost<br /><br /><b>[He is now ready to continue his development and learn from the likes of club captain <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a>, who plays in the same position]</b> Of course I’m learning every day because I’ve not played at this level before. There are little bits here and there where they help me on the performance side and show me how it’s done. Yeah, <b>[I am learning]</b> positioning, everything. Where to go where the ball is on the other side. There’s loads of little things. I’m not sure what’s going to happen in the weeks ahead. I have to take it as it comes. If I’m involved, then I’ll be happy, and if I’m not, I’ll play again</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea match <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Istanbul feat with Champions League comeback against Ajax]</b> It was a crazy game! They were hard to break down and we took adavantage of them going down to nine men, it was a shame we couldn’t win. Scoring a goal is a bonus. The manager told me to come on and liven the boys up, we had chances to win it but from where we were at half time it’s a good result</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James has extended his link with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> until 2025]</b> Reece James has signed a new long-term contract at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Football Club that commits him to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> until at least the summer of 2025. The defender, who turned 20 last month, has made 18 appearances for the Blues this season, scoring on his debut in our big Carabao Cup victory against Grimsby Town. More memorably, his dramatic equaliser earned us a Champions League point against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in a thrilling 4-4 draw at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> in November.<br /><br />James missed just one league game on loan in the Championship with Wigan last term and claimed a clean sweep of individual honours at their end-of-season awards before his return to SW6. He suffered an ankle injury in the summer while playing for England Under-20s at the Toulon Tournament but remained in <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s plans despite a three-month spell on the sidelines and has started our past three games in all competitions</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James has extended his link with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> until 2025]</b> It has been my dream to be here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and play week in week out and to have a contract for another five-and-a-half years is living the dream again. I have always wanted to be here and another five-and-a-half years means a lot to me and a lot to my family</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Reece James has admitted he is delighted to be compared to David Beckham]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> is a legend and probably one of the best crossers of the ball there has been in world football. To be mentioned in the same sentence as his crossing is very good for me but he did it for many years and I have to respect what he did. I have only done it for a few games. A lot of people have said about it but I need to maintain it and keep on improving. If there is a free-kick there and it is for me, I would not put it past me. It is similar skill, not too much difference<br /><br />Being injured at the start of the season was tough and then I slowly got back into it and I was given my chance against Grimsby, scoring on my debut was great, and ever since then I haven’t really looked back. We started talking about a new contract about two months ago. When I started getting in the team and playing week in week out, everything has picked up. I have been here nearly my whole life and I would be happy to spend the rest of my career here. It is the club I have supported throughout and I have committed long-term. Obviously it is going to be tough when everyone else is getting their chance and you are out injured on the sidelines, but you just have to get back right and take time and then make sure when you get your chance you take it. It took a bit longer to get back than I was expecting but you just have to take it how it comes</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Reece James has identified <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> as the toughest opponent]</b> <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> - he’s got loads of skills and he’s very fast. He’s quite slight but I didn’t realise how strong he was until I was up side by side with him. There are different team brackets and every team has three or four players that you think ‘wow, why are you not playing at a bigger club? There are so many great players in the league’<br /><br />If you haven’t played too many games in the team then you’re not really going to have the right understanding of what to do and when to do it. The more you play, the easier and more fluent it becomes<br /><br />It started off very slowly. I was injured coming off the back-end of last season and as I started to pick up and play games, everything has happened so fast. It took me by surprise - I knew I was going to be in and around <b>[the squad]</b> but I didn’t think I’d be this involved. Frank is a club legend and to this day everyone still looks up to him. He’s got a lot of advice to give to all of us because he played at the highest level so you have to listen to him. He’s had a big impact ever since I got back fit. He’s told me what I’m doing well and where he still thinks I can get better</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James reveals <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> transfer snub before making <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> breakthrough]</b> He wanted to sign me for Derby last January, but it didn’t go through. I was happy playing at Wigan. It was good to know he rated me, although that was at Championship level, and when you get a big job at a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team, sometimes minds can change. But we spoke when he arrived and he said he wanted to give me a chance. I was injured, and he told me to come back in the best shape possible. I’m thankful that I’ve got to work with him.<br /><br />I admired <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and all the main leaders of the team when I was a kid. Every other game, he would score a brilliant goal. When I heard he was the manager, it was great - he’s a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James makes transfer pick when it comes to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> returns]</b> I’d probably have De Bruyne. Both are great at their position. There’s no major reason for De Bruyne over Salah. Just like his style of play<br /><br /><a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>. I just loved the way he played. I still love him. He’ll go down as one of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s best players ever<br /><br />For me, I go <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. Growing up I’ve always liked the way he’s done things<br /><br />I played half and half last season while on loan. Right-back is my main position, but if I’m needed somewhere else, I would do it<br /><br /><b>[happy to reveal that a switch to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> could appeal to him at some stage in the future]</b> I’ll never say never. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a great league and other players have gone later in their career</p>

It was natural for them to be my team. My brother supported Man United but <a href="lauren.html">Lauren</a> (sister) and I were always <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

Even now, as my manager, he’s great. He’s a man-to-man manager and he says what he thinks. If he thinks you should be doing more, or even if you’re doing well, he will pull you to a one side and tell you that. I appreciate that about him. The way he’s been around me, and all the players for that matter, is very good<br /><br /><b>[Assessing his season to date]</b> Ever since I’ve been back from injury, it’s been going pretty well for me. Obviously in the early days it was tough getting some minutes because I was still coming back from quite a bad injury, but as the season’s gone on I feel like I’ve gradually got better and improved. This is the club I want to play for and I have worked very hard to get to this point. I always felt that my ability was good enough and I’m just thankful that the gaffer has given me the chance to play</p>

  <p><b>[Reece James picks favoured <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> position after seeing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> embrace his versatility]</b> I probably prefer right-back but there is not much in it. I will happily play right-back and midfield - I have played there enough that I am comfortable playing that position as well<br /><br />This season was slow getting started, because I was injured at the start. But, as I found my rhythm and the season has gone on, I think my performances have picked up. I think it’s great that loads of players I played with coming through the academy are now in the first team as well. I think it shows how hard the academy works and the effort they put in to produce good players</p>
