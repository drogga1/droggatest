<blockquote>
  <p>[Lekhwiya’s midfield maestro Nam Tae Hee believes that his side’s title coronation is only the start of a potential domestic treble this season for the Red Knights] This is my fourth title with Lekhwiya, and for me it was the closest title race. Al Sadd played very well and in the end it was only a two point gap between the two sides. It’s been tough at times this season, but my team-mates have stuck together and played well when we have been missing some big players. It’s a fantastic feeling to lift the title again with Lekhwiya.<br /><br />I am so happy to be with the team, we still have important games in the Qatar Cup, the Emir Cup and AFC Champions League. The league title is only the first title that Lekhwiya can win this season, after this we can start to look towards the new season<br /><br />Al Sadd and Al Rayyan have played well this season and they will be a challenge for us in the Qatar Cup and Emir Cup. Nothing is easy in Qatar when competing for trophies, but we will continue to fight for what is available for the side</p>
