  <p><b>[Lekhwiya’s midfield maestro Nam Tae Hee believes that his side’s title coronation is only the start of a potential domestic treble this season for the Red Knights]</b> This is my fourth title with Lekhwiya, and for me it was the closest title race. Al Sadd played very well and in the end it was only a two point gap between the two sides. It’s been tough at times this season, but my team-mates have stuck together and played well when we have been missing some big players. It’s a fantastic feeling to lift the title again with Lekhwiya.<br /><br />I am so happy to be with the team, we still have important games in the Qatar Cup, the Emir Cup and AFC Champions League. The league title is only the first title that Lekhwiya can win this season, after this we can start to look towards the new season<br /><br />Al Sadd and Al Rayyan have played well this season and they will be a challenge for us in the Qatar Cup and Emir Cup. Nothing is easy in Qatar when competing for trophies, but we will continue to fight for what is available for the side</p>

  <p><b>[Lekhwiya playmaker Nam Tae Hee picked up the Best Player award at the 2017 Qatar Football Association awards]</b> Beating Xavi to win the award: For me, Xavi deserved the best player this season. He played all the games and he played well. They <b>[Al Sadd]</b> won two important cups this season. For me, he deserves the best player honour. Of course, I’m happy to get this trophy with Xavi and Haydoos in contention for the best player <b>[award]</b>.<br /><br />It was very tough to win the Qatar Stars League but we pushed ourselves by trying to win every game. All the players and the coach deserve credit for Lekhwiya winning the title. Winning this award is special. This is the first time and I hope it isn’t the last time!<br /><br />I don’t know <b>[about getting more starts for South Korea]</b>. The national team is different than Lekhwiya. The national team have many, many good players and they deserve to play every game. I’m always fighting to be amongst the first eleven players. We will see. Now we have important games against Qatar, Iran and Uzbekistan for the World Cup berth.</p>

  <p><b>[Lekhwiya’s Nam Tae Hee lauds tough performance against strong Persepolis side]</b> The Iranian team is strong and has players with good level and so returning with a point from the draw is very good. We have a chance in the home match in Doha to achieve victory and qualification. We will be able to present a better level in Doha and achieve victory. That it is the only way to qualify to the quarter-finals.</p>
