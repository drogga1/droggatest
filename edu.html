  <p><b>[Edu, who went from being paralysed to playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Brazil]</b> I spent one year exactly lying in my bed. I was 14 years old. One day I went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, but I couldn’t move. My back was in immense pain. My father tried and tried to get me up, but he couldn’t. From that point I spent one year lying in the exact same position. We had doctors. We had specialists. They couldn’t discover what was wrong. I couldn’t eat. I lost a lot of weight - I dropped to 48kg with the same height I have today (1.85m). I had to urinate and defecate lying down. I had to shower lying down. My mother had to be beside me 24/7. My father had to be beside me 24/7. Then, one day I woke up and, just as it had come, it had gone. Well, not overnight, but bit by bit. Corinthians were so important for me at this time. They didn’t release me. I was just a kid in their youth team who, after such an injury, nobody thought had any chance <b>[of becoming a professional]</b>. And they gave me every support possible. We didn’t have the money to go to private hospitals, but Corinthians insisted on paying and took me to the best possible hospitals. Even when I returned <b>[to being able to walk]</b>, everyone expected them to release me because I was a bit lopsided. But they stuck by me and, slowly, I started getting better. Then my life took off</p>

We will create some ground for him to get his self-confidence back, and that it goes up without too much pressure on his performances. He will keep doing what he has been doing at Paris Saint-Germain. There is a physical part, then a technical aspect. But there will also be the emotional side, so he understands the magnitude of what we are doing.</p>

It will be a great honour and I will certainly remember the great moments I had with Arsenal’s supporters, and most of all at the Emirates stadium and at Highbury too.

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> director Edu confirms <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will have a big say in transfers]</b> Mikel has to be involved in recruitment, he must. We talk about what we need, the characteristics of the players, the system we’re going to play and then I start the process internally. That’s my role. If he has names, if he advises or wants advice on players, that’s fine. If he wants to talk to the other guys <b>[like scouts]</b> of course he will talk to them, but normally that’s my process. That’s why the relationship between us needs to be very strong. I have to understand his points and he has to understand the club’s points. Then we build everything together - that’s the main point<br /><br />My first conversation with him was not about football and that’s what I really loved. It was about concepts, respect, people and staff but not football. My beliefs and his beliefs are the same. We were talking about life, about family, how important it is for the players to understand the importance of being together and respecting the club. After that conversation I was really surprised - we connected straight away with our ideas, philosophy and lifestyle. So before we went through the technical part, I felt he was a special guy. After that, we went to football. I explained to him the team we had, the system we played, the system we believe we can play in the future, how we see the team. I did a presentation to him about our squad and then listened to his thinking. He was really excited. And then there was a presentation by him to show me a little bit about his philosophy. Then we, together, started to create a plan. We interviewed a lot of people and that was a very beautiful experience for me, less than six months into the job myself. You have to get to know the person, not just the coach. You see his family, his children, his character as a father and husband. That what I call the base. He has a very, very, very beautiful base</p>
