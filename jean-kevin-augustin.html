  <p><b>[Jean-Kevin Augustin explains why he joined <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> and not <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> after late move from Red Devils]</b> I had already made my decision as a player this was the best plan and project. We looked at videos of <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and I could see this was my style. Pressing high, good in possession and working hard. We thought I would fit in nicely. Things happened quickly. I didn’t have to think more than a second about coming here. I decided to play for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> straight away. I had one or two other clubs interested. I didn’t want to go anywhere just for the sake of it, I wanted to play and to have clear aims and objectives for the season like <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> have. It wasn’t a case of turning <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> down, it was a case of I had already made my decision<br /><br /><b>[He said of linking up with <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a>’s promotion-chasing Championship table-toppers]</b> I am a quick attacker, mobile. I am comfortable running in behind or dropping deep. I am good at finding space. As well as speed, I can run long distances and run hard and I think I am decent in front of goal. We will work in training to help the squad and to achieve our goals. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> score goals, and create chances. It is joyful scoring goals and it gives status to the team. My job is to work with the lads as we march forward together. Fitness wise I am ready, 100 per cent. When you come to a new club you need time to adapt to the new players, runs off the ball, see how you fit in. If the coach slowly but surely brings me on for a few minutes, I will adapt. The intensity of the Championship is high<br /><br /><b>[Augustin, who spent the first half of the 2019-20 campaign on loan at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> I have no regrets coming here. I had a decent first season at Leipzig, did ok, then we got a new coach and I didn’t have many games. At <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> again I didn’t feature much. I wanted a change. It was worth taking time to see how <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> played and focus on what a good plan it was here for the future. I am not looking back</p>
