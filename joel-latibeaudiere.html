  <p><b>[Manchester City youngster Joel Latibeaudiere says the example of <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> and the guidance of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> offer the club’s young prospects all the motivation they need]</b> I remember when I played for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and I was playing against Phil at Under-10/11 level and he was always one of the standout players for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. Growing up with him through City, we all know that he’s always been special. When he starts to get more regular minutes, I think it will be ridiculous how fast he adapts and takes off because his talent is ridiculous. It’s great to see when the manager plays the youngsters. It makes you feel like there’s definitely a chance. All it takes is one training session or if he throws you on for ten minutes and you play that ten minutes really well, he’s going to see that and take you under his wing. It’s good to see that he trusts the youngsters<br /><br /><b>[Latibeaudiere only played five times for Twente during his time on loan]</b> 100 per cent, just because of the chances you get out there. It <b>[the Eredivisie]</b> was a lot more tactical. Because we weren’t one of the top, top teams in the Eredivisie, we had to try and get an edge tactically as well. So we would set up in different ways to press oppositions and different ways to play around and find their weaknesses. Whereas, when I’m at City, we’re a dominant team, so we know we can play our way most of the time. It was good to learn how to play differently for different oppositions. Now I’ve got a taste for it, it’s given me that motivation to know that I can do it myself. I’m just going to keep pushing myself now and try and get there</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Latibeaudiere is already mulling over his transfer options for next season]</b> Just to get out there playing first team football. Literally the whole team from that World Cup has gone on to play at a first team club. That would definitely be the next step on my ladder for sure. Hopefully getting to somewhere like a Championship or another first division to keep playing my football<br /><br />Most of my career I’ve played the whole way across the back four. I made my under-18s debut at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> as a left-back believe it or not. The manager at Twente saw my strength, speed and willingness to get up and down the line so tried to play me regularly there and I had fun<br /><br />I do think my natural position and where I’m best at is centrally but I can definitely see myself moving to a full-back slot if that’s what the manager needs.<br /><br />I’m lucky enough to have the skill set to do that and obviously doing it at a younger age by playing left-back, centre-back and right-back in my academy career so that puts me in good stead to play as a versatile player which managers do look for nowadays</p>
