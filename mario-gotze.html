  <p><b>[Mario Gotze on a private evening with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> coach <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> We had an Asian meal, but I wouldn’t really call it a date. It was, however, a very special talk in a relaxed atmosphere. Even there, the coach spoke more than anything about football and the way he sees the game, but he doesn’t forget to find out how things are with you personally. Such an honest conversation with the coach is very important to a player</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze spoke on his return to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>]</b> When I completed the switch from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> to <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> in 2013, it was a conscious decision and one that I do not wish to hide from today. Three years later, and now at 24 years of age, I am able to see the decision I made back then differently. I can understand the fact that many fans were unable to understand my decision. Nowadays I wouldn’t make the same choice again! If I am now to return to my hometown club, then I want to try to win everyone over - especially those who do not welcome me back with open arms - with my performances. My objective is to get back to playing my best football. For all of us, the club and the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> fans</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze’s pro evolution]</b> For me, playing through all the youth teams at Borussia Dortmund was a really good experience because I was able to play against talented opponents at a relatively early age. I started learning whilst I was young and at a great playing level. It was a very positive time for me<br /><br /><b>[The immense faith shown by Klopp is not lost on Gotze]</b> I’m still in touch with Jurgen. Of course, he taught me everything about professional football. At that time, I was just 17 and coming up from the youth team. He introduced me to everything. He let me play</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze has expressed his admiration for Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola]</b> Pep Guardiola was technically one of the best coaches, a tremendous enrichment. But I had the feeling that he thinks only in the grid and leaves out the people and the outside. The empathy was not that big. It was not easy for me, just because I came from Kloppo, who was like a footballing father. Pep was a complete difference. A world-class coach needs empathy, every athlete is also human and you should combine both..<br /><br />I did not think so far, on what it meant and how people react on it. When I look back, it can be said that it was selfish, but in the end it is also a competitive sport</p>

And I was also interested in working with him again.<br /><br />It’s still existing. He is a world-class coach and that’s why it’s always an option. I decided to join Borussia Dortmund, but it was not a decision against Liverpool or Jurgen Klopp. But on the contrary</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze’s Dortmund evolution]</b> I think at the time I was with Dortmund, which was also during Jurgen’s <b>[Klopp]</b> time there, we had a very good team and were definitely equals to Bayern Munich. We won the Bundesliga twice in those three years, we won the cup and played Bayern in the Champions League final. So, we certainly felt we were their equals and accepted the challenge that went with that, and we were equally hungry to win titles. And that’s just what we did. It was such a very, very good .</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze’s Bayern Munich evolution]</b> It was a big step for me to go to Bayern Munich. Of course, the expectations were different than at Dortmund, but that’s what I wanted. I had a great time. For three years I won a lot of titles, played a lot of games, played with a lot of really good players. I really couldn’t believe I was a part of it at such a young age. I left home at 21 to go and play for Munich and was immediately able to perform at a high standard. It was totally surreal and I had no idea where it might lead.<br /><br />Klopp and Guardiola are two sensational managers. You can recognise their philosophies and in general, see how they work. Pep is very tactical and focuses on keeping possession of the ball, Jurgen is very much about going into every game head on. His humanity and the fact that he can lead a team or an individual player, respond to the individual and then transfer that to football, well that’s awesome</p>

  <p><b>[The importance of hydration]</b> I think hydration is an important topic. Drinking plenty of fluids is especially important for athletes. You need to find the right balance and provide your body with as much fluid as it needs to supply your muscles and body so that you can optimise your performance. I think it’s crucial for athletes to get plenty of fluids whether their regime is intensive or not. For me generally, I eat and drink a lot so that I’m always at the top of my game. How much you need to drink depends on a lot of factors. Are you training outside, is it hot, is it cold? There are a lot of factors to take into consideration.</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze’s evolution to World Cup winner]</b> That is, of course, an incredibly vivid moment for me. Scoring that goal was just the greatest experience. To have scored against Argentina in Brazil, at the point in time, and how it all turned out, I think if you could imagine such a moment, you couldn’t imagine it better than that. At times it’s more present in my mind than at other times, but it’s always there.<br /><br />It wasn’t so easy, after such a success, to process it all; you have three or four weeks off, at the most, and then you have to start training again. It <b>[the goal]</b> will always be with me, which is really nice; on the other hand though, you know that life goes on, I still have my career ahead of me and still have many years of playing. I’m really looking forward to that, too</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund’s Mario Gotze has labelled the English top flight as a very attractive league]</b> I can only judge from a Bundesliga perspective as I’ve only played in Germany so far. So, in that sense, it’s difficult to make comparisons. As an outsider, I have to say that the Premier League is a very attractive league. In England, there are five, six, seven big clubs and you can never be sure who will win the title in the end. It’s very exciting<br /><br />Tottenham are very strong and have a great project. Mauricio Pochettino has been around for a long time, they have players of tremendous quality who have been there for a long time too - it’s great to build on projects. We played against Spurs in the Champions League group stage last year and we lost both games. We know how important the match is for us and how good our opponents are. It will certainly be an interesting clash<br /><br />Kane brings enormous quality. He is extremely important to the team. Historically, I know that such games are often decided on small margins. Their injuries might be a small advantage to us, but on the whole it will still be two difficult games. We need as many as possible to stay fit so that we have the best team we can. That will be decisive. Reus brings tremendous quality as a player and has also taken over as captain in the summer, a role he has mastered brilliantly. It’s not just what he does on the pitch but what he does off it as well. He sees and addresses things and helps us to understand what’s important and what’s not important in terms of mentality. His performances on the pitch always make things easier for us<br /><br /><b>[One star player who will make the clash is Christian Eriksen]</b> You could compare us. The positions he takes, the way he plays, the space he sees, the goals he scores… he’s an extremely important player for Tottenham. The continuity of his performances are clear too. I can see why his successes and his style of playing have similarities to mine</p>

We never stopped talking.<br /><br /><b>[On Klopp and Guardiola]</b> They are difficult to compare because they pursue different philosophies. The fact is that both are extremely successful. I am grateful to have worked with two such outstanding coaches. I watch the games of both teams as often as possible, the title fight in the Premier League is extremely exciting</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze says he was intimidated by Jurgen Klopp when he first broke into the Borussia Dortmund team]</b> <b>[Klopp]</b> was my first manager, and he was the one who believed in me and gave me the chance to debut at 17 years old. It’s funny to see him now with Liverpool, because he’s such a natural guy in front of the media. He’s so authentic and he says whatever he wants. But I think most people just see the version of him standing on the touchline. There’s a very serious side as well. When I was 17 or 18, and not giving 100% in training, he would be so intimidating. He used to come running over and get right up in my face and start shouting at me. I can’t really translate from German perfectly, but you know how he talks, with his teeth grinding: ‘You have to have more passion! You have to give everything! F*ck! Come on!’ Then after training, he would be completely calm again, and he’d take you aside and say: ‘Mario, how are you? Let’s talk about life. What’s happening?<br /><br />He knew how to handle me. He was an outstanding coach, but his personality was the most important thing for me as a young player. I have never met a manager in football who was so naturally funny. I will never forget the time I ran into him in Dusseldorf during the summer. He was going to see the specialist there to have his hair transplant done. This became big news in Germany, but he was so funny about it. He was smiling, telling me all about it - how cool it was going to look and everything. And then as he was leaving, he just gave me a wink and he said: ‘Mario, don’t worry, I will save the phone number.’ I said: ‘What do you mean?’ He said: ‘The doctor’s number. I’ll save it for you. In a few years, you might need it.’ Then he laughed and walked off. Most people would be embarrassed or not say anything, but he didn’t care at all. He was such a funny and positive influence on everyone around him. I have to thank him, because he gave me my start, and we achieved some great things together at Dortmund in those years<br /><br /><b>[Pep Guardiola was in charge of Bayern during Gotze’s spell in Bavaria]</b> It is hard for me to say that going to Bayern was a mistake, because I did learn an incredible amount about football from Pep. He could talk to you about tactics literally for hours, and I learned to see the game from a new perspective. The level of training was the most intense and meticulous that I’ve ever experienced. It was special to experience him as a coach and as a person, just as it was with Klopp. So I’m conflicted when I think about that time. It was extremely difficult leaving Dortmund, but if I don’t make that change, if I don’t go to Bayern, does the World Cup happen in the same way?</p>

  <p><b>[Gotze has admitted that living up to his billing on the back of netting a World Cup-winning goal has been difficult]</b> Once I stop playing, it will probably be the experience I cherish most, the first thing that comes to mind. There is nothing more amazing <b>[than the final goal]</b>. But for my active career, it was not that great, perhaps. The strong emotional response created huge expectations. It became lodged in people’s minds that I was the guy to score decisive goals in decisive games all the time. That was the assumption out there</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze advised to join clubs like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> or <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>]</b> When I give lectures, I always show the audience one scene at the end - Mario Gotze’s goal in the 2014 World Cup final. I always see a smile on the faces and I enjoy it, too. At the same time, I always feel a little sad. I wonder what has happened since then. What happened to this outstanding soccer player who could do everything? I can’t find answers to these questions. Probably only Mario Gotze himself can find them. The crux of the matter was his move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. When he went to Munich in the summer of 2013, his development was not yet complete. Even after returning to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he never really got back to his best there. He has to change some things. He lost his speed and should change his game, be more of a playmaker. He is no striker. He should leave all this social media crap behind and concentrate solely on sport too. Sometimes, when I see him on Instagram, I wonder if he’s still a footballer or a show act</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze had been represented by Volker Struth and SportsTotal but has decided to change direction]</b> After intensive consideration, I have decided to reposition myself in the sporting planning of my career. I deliberately took the time necessary for this step because it is an important course for me in the future, because I want to separate my professional and private <b>[life]</b>. I’m really looking forward to working with Reza Fazeli and his agency International Soccer Management, whose professional competence has convinced me.</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze Ran To Ask Lionel <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> For A Picture After 2014 World Cup Final]</b> If I am honest, I was in a conference room and I had won the medal for Man of the Match. I saw him (Messi) from behind and went running after him to get a picture, so it was actually the other way around (I asked Messi)</p>
