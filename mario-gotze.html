  <p><b>[Mario Gotze on a private evening with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> coach Pep Guardiola]</b> We had an Asian meal, but I wouldn’t really call it a date. It was, however, a very special talk in a relaxed atmosphere. Even there, the coach spoke more than anything about football and the way he sees the game, but he doesn’t forget to find out how things are with you personally. Such an honest conversation with the coach is very important to a player</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze spoke on his return to Borussia Dortmund]</b> When I completed the switch from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> to <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> in 2013, it was a conscious decision and one that I do not wish to hide from today. Three years later, and now at 24 years of age, I am able to see the decision I made back then differently. I can understand the fact that many fans were unable to understand my decision. Nowadays I wouldn’t make the same choice again! If I am now to return to my hometown club, then I want to try to win everyone over - especially those who do not welcome me back with open arms - with my performances. My objective is to get back to playing my best football. For all of us, the club and the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> fans</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze has held discussions with Borussia Dortmund about extending his contract but revealed he is open to a move abroad]</b> I am now going into my 10th Bundesliga season, so it’s logical foreign countries sometimes play a role in your thoughts. As a footballer, you have the privilege of being able to work in almost every country in the world. There have already been one or two conversations with BVB. I have one more year on my contract and I am totally relaxed in every aspect<br /><br /><b>[Dortmund are believed to have spent more than €100 million ($112m, £90m) to sign Mats Hummels, Thorgan Hazard, Nico Schulz and Julian Brandt ahead of the 2019-20 season. However, Gotze warned such expenditure alone will not be enough to overthrow Bayern Munich]</b> In the end, what it looks like after the 34th matchday is all that counts. And many new additions do not necessarily mean success. If you have ambitions and big goals, you have to buy quality to get better. Money alone, however, is no guarantee of a title.<br /><br /><b>[On his reunion with Mats Hummels]</b> Mats and I have been through a lot of great things together, things we’ll never forget; we’ve won a World Cup together, celebrated Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal titles. But today things are a little different than they were back then. We have a different coach and the team is completely different.<br /><br /><b>[Bayern’s only major moves in the transfer market have been to bring in Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard, but Gotze does not think that means they can be discounted as title favourites]</b> Bayern’s only major moves in the transfer market have been to bring in Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard, but Gotze does not think that means they can be discounted as title favourites</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze believes the signings of Julian Brandt and Thorgan Hazard will be key in helping Borussia Dortmund to finally eclipse Bayern Munich and win back the Bundesliga crown]</b> I think Julian Brandt is very, very good. I got to know him with the national team and I think he can bring us to a higher level again - especially when you see his achievements from last season. He can bring us forward on the wings as well as in the centre. It’s a very good transfer for Borussia Dortmund<br /><br /><b>[Gotze of the Thorgan Hazard]</b> At Gladbach and the Belgium national team he has shown very good performances. As I’ve said, I think it’s great when we get good players and the competition is there to reach the next level. This will definitely help us to become even more successful and a better team. This will also increase the quality in training again<br /><br /><b>[Gotze wouldn’t be drawn on the matter of whether he would seek to move abroad and end his decade-long spell in the Bundesliga]</b> It’s of course an issue, because it’s just been my 10th Bundesliga season. Anything can happen in football, but it’s like I’ve generally thought about where I’d really like to go. As of now I have one more contract in Dortmund and I feel well in the Bundesliga. Otherwise I would not have played here for so long</p>

  <p><b>[Game of Thrones: Mario Gotze weighs in on controversial final season]</b> Game of Thrones is my favourite series. The story and the style is sensational in my eyes. The last season is hard to evaluate. In general, I think that it is very well done and narrated, but it could have been more detailed. There were still so many topics that could have been illuminated. At the end, I had expected something else, but in the end, the whole series was still a very rounded and beautiful thing. From the beginning I have been very sympathetic to Jon Snow. His whole story with all the twists was incredibly exciting</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze has opened up on his omission from Germany’s 2018 World Cup squad, claiming he is not a guy who will cry about it]</b> It <b>[the decision]</b> was definitely borderline and hard to take. I’ve been a professional since I was 17. I was part of the national team at 18, celebrated success with them and made 63 international appearances. The tournaments are always special. Nevertheless, not being called up for 12 months was an important experience for me. I’ve learned from that and have drawn the right conclusions. That took me a step further. Since it was a new situation <b>[not being called up]</b>, I couldn’t prepare myself in advance. The refusal was really tough to take. In those situations, the affection from those close to me was very important. I’m not a guy who will cry about it. Of course, it was hard, but it doesn’t help to think negatively about it, or to mope. I try to draw strength from these situations and find solutions. If you compare such a situation with the real problems of other people, it’s just trivial<br /><br /><b>[He is finally showing the same kind of form which saw him emerge as one of Europe’s finest players in his younger years, under the tutelage of both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola]</b> I’m very grateful to Klopp for the trust that both he and the club <b>[Dortmund]</b> gave me. And when moving to Bayern I was grateful to the club and Pep for getting the opportunity to play at this level. And that’s the way it is now. Above all, I’m very happy that I have the fans back <b>[on his side]</b> after my return</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze believes his 2014 World Cup-winning goal for Germany was not that great for his career]</b> Once I stop playing, it will probably be the experience I cherish most, the first thing that comes to mind. There is nothing more amazing <b>[than the final goal]</b>. But for my active career, it was not that great, perhaps. The strong emotional response created huge expectations. It became lodged in people’s minds that I was the guy to score decisive goals in decisive games all the time. That was the assumption out there<br /><br /><b>[Gotze is content with first performing for Dortmund]</b> It would be great to play another big <b>[international]</b> tournament, but it’s not my target right now. My priority is to reach my personal goals with Dortmund. I can’t influence anything else. There is always an element of luck involved in getting called up<br /><br /><b>[Gotze believes he can enjoy his football under Lucien Favre]</b> I’m doing well, I’m relaxed, I’m very cool. In any job, it’s important that you’re feeling comfortable, that your body works and that you can find your inner balance. The most important thing for me right now is to enjoy playing football. I want to relish the experience in the knowledge that many things tend to happen over the course of a season. To deal with these situations, to appreciate them, that’s the trick. What does ‘doing justice to your potential’ mean? I’m not a big fan of imagining what could have been. There is no point. All I can do is to stay true to myself and to the journey I’m on. I want to grow, I want to improve, I want to achieve the maximum possible at any given moment. I want to be able to say that I went my own way at the end and performed to the very limit of my ability</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Gotze advised to join clubs like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> or West Ham]</b> When I give lectures, I always show the audience one scene at the end - Mario Gotze’s goal in the 2014 World Cup final. I always see a smile on the faces and I enjoy it, too. At the same time, I always feel a little sad. I wonder what has happened since then. What happened to this outstanding soccer player who could do everything? I can’t find answers to these questions. Probably only Mario Gotze himself can find them. The crux of the matter was his move to Bayern. When he went to Munich in the summer of 2013, his development was not yet complete. Even after returning to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he never really got back to his best there. He has to change some things. He lost his speed and should change his game, be more of a playmaker. He is no striker. He should leave all this social media crap behind and concentrate solely on sport too. Sometimes, when I see him on Instagram, I wonder if he’s still a footballer or a show act</p>

I’m really looking forward to working with Reza Fazeli and his agency International Soccer Management, whose professional competence has convinced me.</p>
