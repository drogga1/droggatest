<blockquote>
  <p>[Meite was just an amateur before he got picked up by the Ask Godders Academy. However, his exceptional natural talent convinced the team’s manager Godfrey Torto to put him forward for professional trials] This time last year I didn’t have a team I was just playing around locally in parks and everywhere I played people would come up to me and tell me: I feel like you’re good enough to go somewhere in football.<br /><br />The [AG Academy] helped me a lot, they got me into a non-league club and I scored a few goals there. Then I went on trial with Leicester City, after that I signed with Cardiff City. Neil Warnock brought me into his office and said: ‘Listen, I really like you’. It’s the best gaffer I’ve had. He put his trust in me and gave me the chance, and I took my chance</p>
