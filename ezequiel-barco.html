  <p><b>[Ezequiel Barco ​has tried to put to rest rumors that he will be leaving <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> for Europe in the near future]</b> I want to continue here in Atlanta United. I’m calm about it <b>[the speculation]</b>. I think this <b>[Atlanta]</b> is a great team where I can continue to grow as a player and then at the end of the year we’ll see what happens. But today my focus is here and I’m not taking it away from Atlanta.<br /><br /><b>[Rather than being upset at not playing much in 2018, Barco says he was fine with sitting behind and learning from <a href="miguel-almiron.html">Miguel Almiron</a>]</b> Last year of course I didn’t play much. That’s because <a href="miguel-almiron.html">Miguel Almiron</a> is a very important player who made a big difference in this league. In every game he was a difference-maker and he stood out a lot<br /><br />Pity Martinez has shown that he can play in this league and in any other league. We think he’s a very important player for our team. The truth is that it takes time to adapt, but we’re doing everything we can so that he feels comfortable on the field and really show what he did at River Plate.</p>

Also some clubs from France … The truth is that <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> would be a nice possibility, yes. But now I don’t know what will happen with all this pandemic<br /><br />The league that I like the most is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I love it. I spoke to <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Kun Aguero</a> recently, I called him for his birthday. He told me that I had to make the jump to Europe, to go to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Let him sweeten <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s ear a little, ha! It would be nice, yes.</p>
