  <p><b>[Juventus have begun negotiations with Schalke over full-back Sead Kolasinac]</b> There is nothing new to report. My agent and the club are in contact. Currently I am a Schalke player and want to continue to play a good season. Many say my style of play would fit well in England. But if I move abroad, not only the club changes but you leave your environment, need to build something new. It’s a difficult step which has to be well-considered. The gut feeling decides, but I also need to talk to my family</p>

  <p><b>[Sead Kolasinac speaks about his highlights in 2017, on and off the pitch]</b> Before I was here, I played in a 0-0 draw in the derby between <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and Schalke. I cleared a shot off the line and that will stay in my memory. Also, 2017 was the year I got my first dog, who I have at home with me now. I’ve got a ridgeback and have had him for five months now. It’s a lot of fun with him. He’s called Vuk, which means Wolf in Bosnian. I think a wolf fits to me!</p>

  <p><b>[Kolasinac insists Arsenal are backing Mesut Ozil]</b> That’s the case when you’re a big star, like Mesut is. Of course there are always negative headlines but, as a team, we don’t pay attention to them and Mesut doesn’t either. That’s what’s most important. We’re all behind Mesut - all the staff, all the players. If negative things are written, then that’s just what happens. In life, not everything is positive - sometimes there are negatives written about you too, and he’s had that. But with his performance <b>[against Burnley]</b> he’s quietened a few critics.<br /><br />It was unbelievable. We all know Mesut’s qualities and I only actually made that run because I saw that he had the ball. Not many players would have been able to play that pass. He can, and when I saw him get on the ball, I knew he was going to find me. It was a brilliant pass from him<br /><br /><b>[while each player has their own leadership style, Kolasinac has revealed Ozil has a passive approach]</b> Mesut’s not the sort of player who will scream at you in public just to show the people on the outside that he tries to push us on. He’ll speak in the dressing room, he’ll go to every player individually. With his quality, he brings a lot to this team. He’s very important for us as a captain and as a player</p>

  <p><b>[Sead Kolasinac wants Arsenal to buck their recent trend of falling behind in the Europa League knockout phases]</b> It’s always very difficult when you lose the first game. We are aware of that, it’s not something we want to do of course. It is something we are going to work on in the next round. Of course, the key will be to start better than we have in these last two ties. We didn’t put ourselves in a good position at the end of that first leg. Having said that, I think that away goal was crucial for us. It was difficult for us because we had to play with 10 men for about 50 minutes of that first game as well. We made it difficult, but we knew how strong we are at home and we deservedly went through tonight.<br /><br />I think it characterises us and it characterises this league at the moment as well that all six teams have got through to the quarter-finals. It proves that when people say the Premier League is the best league around, they are not saying it for free. I think it makes the Premier League very interesting and we’re of course proud to have progressed in the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Sead Kolasinac considers Arsenal to be playing really good football]</b> We’re in a good position at the moment. We’ve played some really good football and we’ve been rewarded with some important wins as well. The mood here and at the training ground is a positive one. What we’re doing at the moment is looking at ourselves and do what we can do. We want to take as many points as possible. We’ve got seven very big games and we want to get as much as we can out of those and for us it is about staying where we are in the Premier League at the moment. In the Premier League everything is always possible. I watch some games and I think ‘one team may easily win that’. I may change the channel and come back after the game and read that the team has lost so in this division it is the case that everybody can beat everyone so it is hard to predict how it is going to go<br /><br /><b>[On Unai Emery]</b> He’s a very good coach. Technically he works a lot with us and shows us a lot of video analysis. He picks up on things we aren’t doing so well on. It helps us and brings us forward. It is nice for us to see what we can improve so we can discuss it and make sure we stop those mistakes in the next game. It’s working well for us</p>

  <p><b>[Kolasinac reveals Arsenal’s plan to end woeful away record]</b> We’ve spoken about it amongst ourselves, talked about how we can win our away games. I think if we play in the same way that we do at home, with the same energy, the same urgency that we can take points away from home. It’s not always easy to go away because you are playing against a lot of fans who are pushing their team on, who are really going for the win at home. We have five tough away games, starting at Everton and we know we need to be 100 per cent focused to get the right results.<br /><br /><b>[Kolasinac, however, believes Arsenal must avoid thinking about things that are beyond their own control]</b> We’re not looking at anyone else at all. We are just looking at ourselves. Lots of teams earlier in the season were six or nine points in front of us and we just carried on looking at ourselves. Now we are in a place where we want to be. We’ve got seven games left and we need as many points as possible. So we’re just looking game to game, as we have done all season, and not looking at the others<br /><br /><b>[Walcott will come up against Kolasinac directly]</b> I know Theo from last season. We played together here. That can be a positive, but it can be a negative as well because he knows me too. But Sunday won’t be Arsenal against Theo Walcott. We know he is good and an important player, but they have 10 other players on the pitch who can make the difference. So we’re looking at ourselves and we’re going into the game looking to get all three points</p>

  <p><b>[Sead Kolasinac has brushed off speculation linking Arsenal with a summer move for a new left-back]</b> I think you will always have that speculation, that happens at a club like this. I just look at us as a team at the moment and I want us to finish as positively as possible and I want to be a part of that. What happens in the summer, I don’t know But I’m very happy at Arsenal, I’m really pleased to be playing for a club like this.<br /><br />I feel good. At the start of the season I was injured and it was hard to come back when you have that sort of injury. But I’m 100 per cent now, I’m happy to help my team and to get a few assists as well<br /><br />We watch a lot of videos, he and the rest of the coaching staff really try to help me. We always watch those videos together to improve. A day after a game we will look at what’s gone well, what’s not gone well and we’ll speak about it honestly and try to make those improvements so that they show in the next game<br /><br />It would mean a lot for us all, we really want to be back in the Champions League. It would be good for the club. It’s what the fans want and it’s what the players want. We want to make sure that we’re there</p>
