I cleared a shot off the line and that will stay in my memory. Also, 2017 was the year I got my first dog, who I have at home with me now. I’ve got a ridgeback and have had him for five months now. It’s a lot of fun with him. He’s called Vuk, which means Wolf in Bosnian. I think a wolf fits to me!</p>

  <p><b>[Heavyweight boxing champion Deontay Wilder was impressed by the fighting skills of Sead Kolasinac after watching the video of the carjacking ordeal suffered by the Arsenal defender and his team-mate Mesut Ozil]</b> He’s got a nice bounce to him, he’s in and out. Wait until you see him throw a hook. We don’t know what his technique is like, but his footwork… he’s pretty mobile. We’re going to have to work on him and make sure he doesn’t load up before because he’s very predictable and that makes him very vulnerable. He’s got quick feet, we can work with that<br /><br />It was reported that suspects on motorbikes had attempted to rob a man who was driving a car.

  <p><b>[Sead Kolasinac says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> is ‘a bit unhappy’ with his current predicament at Arsenal]</b> Mesut is a really driven player. He is a bit unhappy at the minute but you would never see that in his training. He is doing everything he can. He is doing extra sessions to make sure he is at the level he needs to be. Mesut is Mesut. He has got a lot of special qualities. For example, the opposing team might put two players on him rather than one, which creates a lot of space for others. That makes a real difference on the pitch and in the game. Everyone knows the quality he has, we have seen it. He is one of the top players in Europe and I think he can achieve a lot and really help the team further when he’s back</p>

I came out and stood next to his car. Suddenly a scooter driver stops next to us. You do not think about it, although I’ve heard many stories about it. Why should it happen to you? Suddenly the robber stands beside you and pulls an object out of his pocket. ‘Okay’, I thought, ‘now it’s my turn’. But I stayed calm and tried to fight back. It was definitely a dangerous situation. We are glad that nothing happened to us. That’s the most important thing. And that’s why it should be forgotten and it’s over<br /><br /><b>[Kolasinac says he still feels totally comfortable in London despite everything that occurred]</b> Yes, that was funny. You go shopping and somebody always watches. But that was discussed with the club as a mere precaution. My wife was by my side and, as was written in Germany, my family and I were not scared. We do not hide. We live our lives. It was important to me that my family was there. My wife, my dad, my dogs. But I did not have to talk to anyone about it to make me feel better. I’m not worried anymore. At no time did I have the idea of leaving London. My family and I are happy and we are happy that everything is back to normal</p>
