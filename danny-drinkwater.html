  <p><b>[Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater has been charged by the FA over an alleged elbow on Watford’s Valon Behrami]</b> Off the ball incidents which are not seen at the time by the match officials are referred to a panel of three former elite referees. Each referee panel member will review the video footage independently of one another to determine whether they consider it a sending-off offence. For retrospective action to be taken, and an FA charge to follow, the decision of the panel must be unanimous</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater has admitted the Foxes felt they could go on and win the Champions League this season]</b> We did believe we could win it. We weren’t in just to take part. We’re a squad that believes we can do things some people probably didn’t think we’re capable of, but we just keep pushing ourselves on the training field and out on the pitch. Now we’ve had a taste of it, we want more. There’s nothing for us to be scared of.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have completed the signing of Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater]</b> I’m delighted to be a Chelsea player and can’t wait to get started. It has been a long journey to get here but I am very happy and am looking forward to helping the club win more trophies.</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Crane was Drinkwater’s first coach at Unicorn. Kenny Crane said]</b> If Drinky was playing for United, Real Madrid, Barcelona or whoever, his personality would stay the same. He will always be his own man. He’s not the most outgoing person, he’s not loud or brash, he’s quite deep. He just gets on with it.<br /><br />I am sure that he would love to have made it at United. He holds no grudge against them and they were probably right at the time to release him but I think it shows his determination to sign for another top four club because he could have easily just drifted through the lower leagues at Huddersfield and Cardiff.<br /><br />It’s not a case of showing that he could have made it at United by going to Chelsea. All the staff that were there have left anyway now. He’s not trying to show them he made a mistake, it is just his own determination to go up to another level from Leicester. He always supported United.<br /><br />I am pleased he got his move to Chelsea. You just want to impress when you move, especially a club like Chelsea in the top four, you have got to hit the ground running and they have some bloody good players.<br /><br />He is frustrated because of his injury and everything but I think it will take him a good number of weeks to get match fit. Hopefully, he can get games in the League Cup. I don’t think they will throw him straight in but give it a few weeks and as he recovers, I am sure that he can do what he did at Leicester, where he did a really good job.<br /><br />Drinky is still best mates with the lads from the club <b>[Unicorn Athletic]</b>. My son Steve and two others guys called Matt and Luke. There’s the four of them, best mates then and they are still best mates now so I have always been close to Drinky following his career.<br /><br />The four of them still go on holiday, he will come around to our house for dinner, he is just normal with his mates. I assume that his mates will be his mates for life. He’s no ‘big time Charlie’, he would never show off his money. You won’t see him getting married and putting the pictures into OK Magazine.<br /><br />He has been back to his school to meet the kids a couple of times. They are really proud of him there, understandably but he’s not a naturally outgoing person. He doesn’t say look at me, if he does something nice then he does it quietly. He doesn’t look to get himself in the newspapers like other players do, to get a few extra quid.<br /><br />His life is no sob story, he is from a solid family unit. His mum and dad are really nice people but his dad still goes to all his games. So do all his mates<br /><br />He would do his own thing because he was good. I would say to him that you are playing on the right wing and you would see him in the left-back position. He always had a little bit extra, he was very small at that age. The most surprising thing about him is his position. As a youngster, he was a goalscoring forward. He scored for fun. He went to academies and played pro and he’s become disciplined. He is disciplined as a central midfielder.<br /><br />He was small for his age and he would go dribbling through four or five players and slot it in, because of his physique he wasn’t hitting it from 20 or 30 yards like he does now. He didn’t have the strength back then. He was a skilful tricky little player.<br /><br />We had a tournament in Blackpool, a national tournament. There was a team from Essex who were supposedly all superstars and they were good. We met them in the final. It was 2-2 and in the very last minute, Drinkwater gets it in his own half and just decided he had enough, went through the lot of them and slotted it in<br /><br />As a kid, he always had that about him. As a kid that was the happiest I have seen, the biggest smile and celebration I have ever seen on his face. When Drinkwater left to go to Manchester United, he asked for his Unicorn Athletic shirt.<br /><br />He has still got that now in a frame next to all his world famous named shirts, he still treasures his little Unicorn one. That is nice, it makes me feel good and I think fair play to the lad</p>
