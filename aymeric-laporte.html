  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte is hoping to make his long-awaited return to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> side early in 2020]</b> <b>[It]</b> is going very well. Still I need time but I hope as soon as possible I can come back and play with my teammates. I can’t say when exactly but more or less one month-and-a-half to two months. I feel my importance to this team. Pep has given me all his confidence and I’m very happy for that. I believe in the team, I hope we can do many, many good things and this year win many trophies, just like last year<br /><br /><b>[There will be plenty to fight for once Laporte comes back into contention]</b> Yes, of course <b>[City can win the title]</b>. Last year was quite similar when <b>[Liverpool]</b> had a similar lead but we still have time this year to recover, to catch them and to again try to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so we hope we can do that. We need to make sure we work a lot and don’t lose any more games</p>

I’m very happy to hear that, but I have to work to be this. I have to keep going to stay there <b>[at the top]</b>.<br /><br />I’m happy to be back on the field. It was very important for me to be back with the team, to be involved in everything. I think it is a good day, we won the game and I’m very happy to be back. The last two years were very tough but this year other teams have improved and have made some transfers. Others have improved, and they have studied us, too. It gets more difficult every year so we have to stay focused, work a lot and concentrate, and be more like we have in the last two years, and try to win every single game<br /><br /><b>[Laporte hopes to be in contention for next week’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester United]</b> Normally I would have been <b>[back]</b> later.

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte insists that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s impending ban from the Champions League will not act as extra motivation]</b> We are professionals, a big team with big personalities in the dressing room, and I think we just think about football, nothing else. We are professionals and have to do our job. That’s all.<br /><br />We don’t need more motivation for anything. Every game is tough and we have to be focused. The Champions League is important for us and we want the best campaign we can do<br /><br />It wasn’t too soon <b>[to come back]</b> - maybe it was sooner than we expected but I felt good and confident and had one or two weeks to rest. It was not easy to come back after five months, to play on that pitch. It was very tough, but not too soon.

I want to play in every game - <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, Madrid, it doesn’t matter.

I am very happy here at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. I am enjoying my football here. We are doing great things here. In the last two years we have won eight trophies<br /><br />That’s (a personal training schedule) the best thing for everyone, that we do it every day.

When we return to normality, when we start training again outside, we have to be ready<br /><br /><b>[on his actions during a period of quarantine for much of the global population]</b> We have the same protocol as has been given out in all countries: stay at home as much as possible, don’t go out in the street, don’t shake hands with anyone.

I could be a world champion… but these are the decisions of the coach, who is not calling me for, I think, personal reasons, and I have to respect him</p>

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte admits it’s been difficult to cope without football for a second time after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down football]</b> For me, it was a long time without football on the pitch and it was so difficult. The second time without football and it is always difficult; don’t touch the ball, don’t be on the pitch in the stadium playing in front of the fans and everything. We have to keep it how it is and waiting for what is the best for our health which, is the most important right now<br /><br />I feel fit, no problems. At home I have many things to do, to train, to run. I have a bike, I have weights, I have many things. I cannot do everything, because it’s is not like being on the pitch. The club gave us a training programme to do at home. Sometimes train together with all of the team. They have given us many things to practice and to do at home. It is strange but now it is normal. Of course <b>[it is important to stay in touch]</b>, we have to keep in touch to be a team and to stay a team. It is a good thing. I don’t know <b>[who I miss seeing the most]</b>. All of them because maybe some days there is one player not in the locker rooms and you feel they are not there<br /><br /><b>[Laporte has been playing games of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20]</b> Don’t ask me about <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> because I don’t know. Everyone says they are the best so I can’t pick just one of them. I am not the best for sure. I don’t look to improve; I just want to have fun</p>

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte is eager to conclude <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s Champions League campaign]</b> I’m missing football a lot - I want to play and train, and I think it’s the first time in my life I have not played for this length of time. Hopefully, soon we’ll be back on the pitch and in the Champions League too. We are waiting for news on what the experts say about that, and this is the most important thing. They are the best at doing this job, and they will try to make the best decision for everyone<br /><br /><b>[Laporte limped out of the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> match and has confirmed that there is no lasting damage after his setback]</b> When we return, I’ll be back in good physical condition. Of course, what we are doing is not the same sport. You need more than just running… you need the ball, the feel of the grass and the contact. I don’t have it at home, so hopefully, soon we’ll be back on the pitch. It was not a big injury, it was just something light. I needed one or two weeks to rest, so I would have been fine for the second leg. It wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been. Everything - my hamstring, my knee - is now OK</p>
