  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte has reiterated his desire to represent France at senior level]</b> There’s been lots of talk on social networks. It wasn’t at anyone, not the national team, Deschamps, or Perrin. I don’t have to justify myself in public. For now, no <b>[Spain cannot tempt me]</b>. As I said a few months ago, in the last U-21 game, I announced it. I want to progress, to make the next step. I have to keep working, but if the opportunity presents itself, I’ll have to make a choice. The French team is where my heart is, it’s where I was born. But if they don’t give me a choice, I’d make a decision as a World Cup or Euro is important to a footballer.</p>

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte has revealed he wants to play for France instead of Spain]</b> I would like to clarify, once more, a few words which have appeared in the media. Today, as a result of an interview, you can see headlines in a lot of newspapers which do not correspond with reality. My objective is to reach the senior France team. I’m still young and I have a lot of years in which to do that. There is no rush, only a lot of excitement. I WANT to play for the France team and, contrary to what is being said, I am NOT putting the coach under any pressure to call me up, neither have I given a nod to the Spanish team <b>[with all due respect to them]</b>. I simply mentioned that if the coach told me that he did not want to rely on me, there are other alternatives. I take the opportunity to say that, for my part, this subject is settled and is more than clear. In fact, I will not reply if you ask me about it.</p>

I want to thank everybody for what you have given me. I arrived as an adolescent and I have been formed here as a person and as a footballer. I don’t want my exit, ahead of a new challenge in my career, to be a ‘goodbye’, but rather a ‘see you soon’. I am leaving a unique club, I will never forget it. For all of that, thank you!.</p>

We must try to win and get the Premier League we all want<br /><br /><b>[On expecting a difficult night at Anfield in midweek]</b> It felt really good. It is a different position but we worked over the week in training sessions and I felt fine. We fight every game like it is the last one and it was very important to win. You always try to play the best you can. But we need to keep on improving. We know Liverpool is a difficult game. They have great players and are in great shape.

  <p><b>[Man City seeking revenge in derby against Man United]</b> There’s always a feeling of revenge any time you lose against any team. We are always ready to compete and need to take advantage of the good momentum of the team at the moment. It’s a very important match for two reasons… because it’s the Manchester derby and also because if we win we will put distance between ourselves and them in the table.<br /><br /><b>[The 6-1 win over Southampton means the ex-France Under-21 international is unbeaten in his first 20 Premier League starts]</b> I think it’s a nice record. I wasn’t aware until someone told me but obviously it’s exciting for me. Breaking records is always nice. Last season as a team we reached 100 points - that was very nice and this year I have this personal record. I hope we don’t lose on Sunday or not this derby or the following derby. The goal is always to win and lengthen this record as much as we can.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City defender Aymeric Laporte has said he wants to be the best defender in Europe]</b> Do I want to be the best defender in Europe? Of course. Any defender will tell you that - who wouldn’t want to be the best? Sergio Ramos is probably the best centre-back in the world at the moment as we know we have to match his standards or better him if we are to be as good as he is. To get to the top, you must have an edge to your game, like Ramos does.<br /><br /><b>[Laporte has asjusted seamlesslly to the Premier League game]</b> It’s similar <b>[to Spain]</b> but more physical, but I am really enjoying that aspect of it. I’ve enjoyed it from day one and I feel very much at home here. Every training session you take part in, you have to work very hard and train hard because there is no other way to get where you want to be - it’s not a secret and not a magic formula - just hard work and application.</p>

All the teams are very competitive and demanding in this competition. That is our main challenge, to try to beat them all..<br /><br /><b>[When Sergio Aguero sealed the draw after 83 minutes, Laporte was relieved]</b> That’s what we had to do, we had to come back twice. That’s why we are happy for the draw and the qualification, because that’s what really matters for us. The main goal from the beginning was qualifying for the round of 16<br /><br />We have a great relationship. We are always together joking all the time and on the pitch it is working well for both of us. We need to take advantage of that.

Of course I don’t think it’s because of a sporting issue, you’d have to ask him personally, I don’t have anything personal against him, but if someone has a problem it’s him and not me. I could be a world champion… but these are the decisions of the coach, who is not calling me for, I think, personal reasons, and I have to respect him. I’m not going to call him. Why? To slam him? No, obviously not. I’m still working in the club, playing at the highest level for this kind of thing <b>[an international call-up]</b>… the only person who can solve this is the coach.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about representing Luis Enrique’s side]</b> Play with Spain?

Being among the best in the league is an important reward and I hope the year will end in style with several titles at the end.<br /><br />Are we stronger than Liverpool? I would say yes, but it’s going to be a little bit different. Liverpool has a very good squad, but I hope we will make the difference. I am here to win every possible title, including the Champions League… The goal is to reach the final<br /><br /><b>[Laporte is yet to receive his first cap for France]</b> I went through all the youth categories, I was captain, but the important thing today is the club and I am focused on that. I do not have the chance to play for France and I’m focusing on Manchester City. If they call me, I would be very happy, it’s a dream to play for France.

It’s been a constant fight, game after game, we were winning our games, but Liverpool too. We managed to keep the point of advantage until the end.

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte is eager to conclude <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s Champions League campaign]</b> I’m missing football a lot - I want to play and train, and I think it’s the first time in my life I have not played for this length of time. Hopefully, soon we’ll be back on the pitch and in the Champions League too. We are waiting for news on what the experts say about that, and this is the most important thing. They are the best at doing this job, and they will try to make the best decision for everyone<br /><br /><b>[Laporte limped out of the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> match and has confirmed that there is no lasting damage after his setback]</b> When we return, I’ll be back in good physical condition. Of course, what we are doing is not the same sport. You need more than just running… you need the ball, the feel of the grass and the contact. I don’t have it at home, so hopefully, soon we’ll be back on the pitch. It was not a big injury, it was just something light. I needed one or two weeks to rest, so I would have been fine for the second leg. It wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been. Everything - my hamstring, my knee - is now OK</p>

They are very different but they know everything about football - different things, but they know everything</p>

  <p><b>[Laporte comments on <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>]</b> Vincent is a very good football player and he’s a very good person. He’s a top man and he helped all of us when we arrived in the locker room. He was attentive to everything, he was trying to help in every session. In training he was working the most and an example for everyone</p>

  <p><b>[He feels he has fully adjusted to life in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, with his reputation being enhanced along the way, but admits life in England has taken some getting used to]</b> In Spain things are more tactical but here it is stronger. You have to be focused, the referee will not signal for fouls if they are a small one. It’s not difficult, but different. I understand that I have to be stronger than ever</p>
