  <p><b>[England fans condemned by police chief after <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> trouble. FA head of security Tony Conniford expressed concern about a ‘stag-do culture’ among an element of the travelling England support for games in more easily accessible destinations such as Portugal]</b> A lot of it is alcohol-fuelled and there almost becomes an acceptance that because you are at the football, anything goes. I find that difficult to buy into and people need to have a look at themselves and start to think, ‘If my relatives, wife or children were here with me, would it be an enjoyable experience?’ And the answer is ‘no’. I don’t want to stereotype people and put everybody into a box. That is very dangerous. But it would be stupid to say we had not recognised groups of young, adult males booking together are the ones we are more concerned about. It’s that holiday, stag-do culture where young guys get together and suddenly anything goes</p>
