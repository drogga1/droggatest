We started the second half with a high tempo, and when Tanguy Ndombele got his goal it was full throttle until the end. We stayed in the game, created a few chances and thankfully a few came to me and I put them away<br /><br /><b>[For Kane and Spurs, the focus now is on building a run of results at the start of the season]</b> It’s the first game but it’s always nice to win, at home as well.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane believes Tottenham can win the Premier League this season]</b> We kept with them for a while last year but they blew ahead after January. We have to make sure we get off to a good start. Liverpool set the standard on Friday night and City on Saturday afternoon, so it’s important that we stay in touch as long as we can. We have full belief that we can go all the way but there’s a long road ahead. That’s why we buy players: to strengthen the squad and have more competition for places. That’s what we’ve got. We’ve got a good, hungry squad. Everyone’s fit and ready to go. The players that came on have to try to make an impact and they did. It’s important for us if we’re going to have a good season. Of course, it’s just the start now but throughout the winter time when loads of games are popping up we need everyone to contribute as much as possible<br /><br /><b>[Despite uncertainty over Christian Eriksen’s future, Kane stressed the importance of the midfielder]</b> Obviously I’ve been playing with Chris now for five or six years and we all know the qualities he has: the assists, the passes, the goals. Whether he starts or is on the bench, the most important thing from all of our points of view is that he gives everything for the team. Obviously, there’s been speculation about his future but as long as he’s training hard and playing as hard as he can when he’s here, that’s all we can ask for. What will be will be but we’re happy to have him. That’s all the fans ask for as well: commitment. We’re happy to have them. We’ll see what happens but from our point of view we’ve got a strong squad and we’ll use that throughout the season</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane credits habits he picked up as a boy as being instrumental in turning him into one of the world’s best strikers]</b> It’s putting in the hard work, first and foremost, and a lot of practice on the training ground. You also need that instinct from a young age - maybe you’re born with it. I think hard work will always override instinct. You see it throughout the years, players who may not technically be as good as others, but at a younger age they work harder, train harder and they get to a higher level because of that. But I think there is an element, especially with top goalscorers, of knowing where the ball is going to fall or being in the right place at the right time<br /><br /><b>[He was given a chance by <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> for the team’s Europa League group stage campaign in 2014]</b> It’s just through habit from doing it when you were a kid scoring goals - you take that with you, maybe without you even knowing. If you add the hard work with that, you become a really good player. Some movements you do on purpose, for example, when you make a cross. Sometimes you do want to move in front to get in behind, even with through balls to come short or go deep, but that’s stuff you can train on</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has questioned the use of VAR in Tottenham’s defeat to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, revealing referee Mike Dean said he had not seen the incident properly when deciding not to award a penalty against Jamaal Lascelles]</b> It’s there to help the referee on the pitch. Mike Dean said that he just didn’t know, he couldn’t see, so that’s where the VAR is there to help him out. If he had said ‘no penalty’ and the VAR was a 50-50, then you can agree. But I don’t know what his conversation was with them upstairs, if he said he didn’t see it or not.<br /><br />I’ve watched it back and find it hard to understand how it hasn’t been given. It’s just like if a goalkeeper comes out, uses his arms and trips you up – it’s a penalty. I kind of tripped over his arm and then his body fell into me. Whether it was deliberate or not, from my point of view it’s hard to take. But I said last week <b>[after the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> game]</b> that with VAR sometimes you are going to get the rub of the green, sometimes not. The offsides are definite because there is a kind of guarantee. The 50-50 ones are always hard. It’s never going to take away that speculation because, like this one, it’s always a matter of opinion<br /><br /><b>[While Kane feels he was a victim of injustice that potentially cost his side a point, he has also been honest about Spurs’ own failings]</b> I don’t think we did enough in the final third to win the game. We didn’t quite have the answers in their box and the final third to get that breakthrough. The decision is the decision but overall we could have done better as a team and it’s just a hard loss to take. I think we have to learn that teams who come here and get an early goal, they’re going to defend and make it tough. We need to have the answers to that.<br /><br />Winning the first game <b>[against Aston Villa]</b> was great and getting a point at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is not a bad result. But this is where we needed to step up if we want to be up there come the end of the season. These are the games at home that you have to win. I said after the first weekend of the season, when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won on the Friday and then <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> won early on the Saturday, that they set the standard with their results. I said we had to keep up with them and make sure we win, especially at home. It’s disappointing that we haven’t done that in only our second home game. It just means we’re going to have to pick up points in the big games, the tough games, and try to improve on what we did against Newcastle<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham certainly have a big game next as they visit <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on Sunday]</b> You never want to go into an international break having lost or drawn, and of course a north London derby is as big as it gets. If we win that it makes the first four games a bit brighter. But it’s not going to be an easy game so we have to make sure we’re prepared and ready for that one. As you’re seeing from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City so far there’s no letting up from them. I said before the start of the season that a team that can put a good run together, get momentum, maybe win for two or three months on the bounce without dropping any points, that’s what it’s going to take <b>[to challenge the top two]</b>. It’s a disappointing start but there’s a long way to go</p>

His record for club and country is no coincidence. It is typical Harry just to respond in the way that he did by scoring a hat-trick <b>[in England’s 4-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win over Bulgaria]</b>. He does not drink, he does not go out. He does extra every day and works on his left foot and right foot.

  <p><b>[Spurs striker Harry Kane targets April return while opening up on ‘strange’ coronavirus situation]</b> I’m not too far away, I’d normally hope to be back with the team in two or three weeks’ time. I’m at a good stage, pretty much doing everything, now it’s about building up my fitness. So from my personal point of view, I’m in a good place. It’s such a strange situation, no-one has been in this situation before. Like anything, you have to take the positives out of it and do what you can. So far, me and the family are well, and I’ll continue to work hard, work in the gym, work from home and do what I can. We’ll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />I’m good. From a rehab point of view and personal point of view, I’m doing really well. I’m at a good stage now and just working hard, doing a lot of recovery, a lot of rehab and just waiting to see what happens to the season. Other than that, my family is well, and obviously everyone is thinking about coronavirus at the moment and it’s a time to be together, to stay safe and hopefully everything will be alright</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane remains undecided on his <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> future]</b> Obviously I get asked this question a lot. It’s one of those things. I couldn’t say yes and I couldn’t say no. I love <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, I’ve always loved <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, but it’s one of those things. I’ve always said it, if I don’t feel we’re progressing as a team or going in the right direction, then I’m not someone to stay there for the sake of it. I’m an ambitious player, I want to improve, get better. I want to become one of the top, top players, so it all depends on what happens as a team and how we progress as a team.

Like you say, I’ve won some individual records, I’ve had great success individually, but I play this sport to win trophies as a team. I don’t think you can take that moment away, working as a team and coming together at the end and being champions. I’m sure that will feel a lot better than breaking a record</p>

There needs to be a point where enough is enough. Probably the time limit for me is the end of June. Playing into July or August and pushing next season back, I don’t see too much benefit in that<br /><br />Obviously I don’t know too much about behind the scenes and financially. If the season’s not completed by the end of June we need to look at the options and just look forward to next season<br /><br />There is a plan A, B and C. The three options are to start again in mid-May, in June or at the end of June</p>

We came under a bit of scrutiny and probably unfair criticism at times<br /><br />From delivery drivers to care workers and doctors to shop workers, they have been amazing. Everyone is doing so much work behind the scenes that not everyone sees<br /><br />I wouldn’t have had as many games as I would have liked or as much training as I would have liked to really get to my highest level. I’m trying to take the positives. This period has given me a chance to recover a bit more. Before lockdown I was at the stage where I was pretty much doing everything except training with the team. The last week or so I have been able to do one-on-one training with one coach on the pitch. It’s a case of getting that feeling back and doing a lot of individual training and finishing</p>

I was at a good stage before the lockdown. I was pretty much doing everything except from training with the team. Since the lockdown’s happened, I’ve continued doing sessions online with the team, a bit of specific work where I do my own stuff for the hamstring and things like that, but pretty much doing everything else the boys are doing. Then obviously the last week or so we’ve been able to go in and do one-on-one training with one member of staff on the pitch. It’s been nice to get out and start touching a ball again. Whenever the season does continue, whether it’s next month, or two months, three months, I should be ready to go from the first game.<br /><br /><b>[Kane’s <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> team-mate <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> was the subject of home invasion this week]</b> I text him the day after it happened just to see how he was. As normal I think he was a bit in shock and a bit angry about the situation but thankfully no one has hurt, no family was hurt, during the process, which is the main thing really. I think he’s okay, a little bit shaken up, but I guess he’s getting on with it</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has declared himself to be fully fit]</b> It has been a funny few months or so having to adapt to the situation, it is great to be back out with the lads, just to feel that team building and get back and competing a little bit more. From the hamstring point of view it is great to be able to give it a bit more rest. I have not played a game for six months now, it has been a long, long time. From an injury point of view I’m normal, I’m fully fit. It will take a while to get back to the team training and feeling that again because I haven’t done that for six months or so. I am feeling food, I am feeling sharp. It has been good to do some individual training, a bit of finishing, a lot of individual drills to work on my game and improve. I am at a stage where I am looking forward to getting some games and hopefully I’ll be back playing before too long.<br /><br />It is a good shock to the system. It has been very intense. I have picked up a few injuries here and there, sometimes people think injuries is the time to rest but it is almost when you’re injured you work harder than before you were injured. It is the first time that I have been able to take my time, re-focus and work on some individual stuff. I have really enjoyed it. Hopefully I’ll be back in a better place before I was injured and look forward to a busy year<br /><br />We have got to finish in the top four, there is no doubt about that. We have got a massive game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the first game and realistically we are going to have to win seven or eight to get into the Champions League. That has got to be our aim. Of course we want to win every game but we have got to make sure we finish strong if we want to be playing Champions League football next season</p>

I can’t wait to get back out there. It’s been long enough without a game, especially when there are top players who are new to the club and you want to be on the pitch with them. I’m looking forward to it, looking forward to playing with everyone again. The squad is looking good.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane said he feels as fit as I’ve ever done after scoring his first goal of 2020 in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s 2-0 win over <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> on Tuesday]</b> As a striker, it’s what you want to do, you want to score goals, you want to help win games. I’m happy to get back on the scoresheet. It was a tough game, it took us a while to break them down. Obviously we had a few chances before we scored the first one, then it was nice to finish it off at the end. When you’ve been out for over six months, it’s getting that feeling back on the pitch. You can train as much as you want, but being out here is totally different. I had a few I probably should have scored – definitely one other – but it was nice to put that one away. I’ve been working very hard all through my rehab, through the lockdown and the warm-up games leading to the first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game. I feel as fit as I’ve ever done before. It’s been a good chance to rest, recover and work on a few things I haven’t been able to over the years. I’m feeling in good shape. I’m someone who, whether I score or not, miss chances, I’m always ready for the next one. I don’t think it bothers me too much. But scoring is one of the best feelings in the world. It’s been a while since I’ve done it. It’s great to get that. We’ve got a little rest now – it’s <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> next in a big game – so hopefully we can continue from this win and take it into the rest of the games.<br /><br />It’s good but it can always be better. Look, 200 games goes so quick. I’ve been playing first-team football now for five or six years and the years just fly by. I’ve got to make the most of it, keep in as good shape as possible. I’m still only 26 and I’ve still got plenty of years to go, so hopefully I can get to that 200 mark sooner rather than later and see where we go from there</p>
