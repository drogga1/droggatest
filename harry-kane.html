  <p><b>[Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has urged Roy Hodgson to call-up Tottenham striker Harry Kane for England]</b> It <b>[the next England game]</b> is not until March and there is a lot of football to play before then. I have just got to keep doing what I am doing and do my best for the team, and we will see what happens. I am working on all aspects of my game and when I get in those areas I am confident. I am enjoying my football at the moment and playing with a smile on my face.</p>

It was a great opportunity for me today. When I got off the bench I was looking to get that goal and thankfully I got on the scoresheet<br /><br />It was great for Wayne to equal the record. A great achievement so we’re all buzzing for him. But the whole team played well. We got the job done, first team to qualify and we don’t want to stop here. We want to keep improving and continue to push on</p>

Soon there will be a new stadium. The future is promising.<br /><br />You have to choose whether to take the money, or follow your own ambitions, playing in the best league in the world and winning titles</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has described Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino as an emotional coach]</b> A lot of the time he’s calm, but he’s very passionate. If he feels the problem isn’t the game but is about our attitude, he’ll tell us we need to work harder or play harder. He’s emotional. And that’s what we want - we all feel the same. We all want to win, we’ve all got the same goal. He’s got two sides to him. He’s very respectful. If you respect him, he’ll show you respect back. If you work hard for him, he’ll give you his time. But he’s ruthless if you cross him. If you don’t want to work for him and you don’t want to be a team player, you won’t be part of the team.<br /><br />When I first met him, I knew he was a respectful guy. Straight away I knew he was someone I could get on with but only if I was working hard, respecting him and being part of the team. That’s what he wanted. He wanted players who would put in extra work for him and he’d show them love back. That’s what we’ve got now. We’ve got a good relationship, great respect for one another and I think he’s one of the best managers in the world - not just tactically on the pitch but off the pitch as well, in the way he manages his players. He’s a great manager to work under. I was young at the time - Adebayor and Soldado were here and they were first choice. I was working hard to try and get that spot. It didn’t work straight away, I had to wait my turn and I wasn’t in squads at times. I went to ask him what I could do better and what I could do to get in the starting XI. He told me a few bits here and there, but mainly to keep working hard. I did, and I got my chance - I managed to go from there</p>

We have got a young team, a young, fantastic manager, we have got a new stadium coming in two years and we have got a new training ground. Everything is progressing as I want it to be and as the club want it to be so, as long as that continues, I don’t see why I can’t stay there for the rest of my career. Some people are motivated by money - I’m not one of them. I am motivated by trying to win trophies. I am happy at Tottenham. I go into work every day with a smile on my face and that is important. Money is a bonus of the job, but it doesn’t always make you happy</p>

We want to find a way to win these sorts of games. We dominated large spells but Chelsea found a way to win. It was similar a couple of years ago, in the <b>[2015 League]</b> cup final, we dominated that as well. It is disappointing and hard to take. I can’t really put a finger on why, it was kind of a bit of luck and then momentum swung their way. It was hard to come back from.<br /><br />They have a great team and a great squad. Whoever comes into their squad is a great player and we were just focused on us. We set out in an attacking way and we wanted to be on the front foot. Even though we went behind quite early, I thought we dominated the game and had the better chances. That’s why we are so disappointed that we didn’t go on to win the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham striker Harry Kane is looking to join the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in an elite group of players to score 50 goals in a season]</b> Fifty goals is a target I’d love to get, obviously. Hopefully I can stay fit for the whole season and yeah, 50 goals is something I’d love to achieve. It’s been a very good year this year, plenty still to work on and improve on. There’s a lot to look forward to next season. It’s very exciting. Obviously coming second last year and the Champions League, we want to improve and going into that World Cup, there’s no better trophy to win in the world<br /><br />Of course I’m going to miss White Hart Lane, no doubt about it. But Wembley’s a fantastic stadium and there’s not many better stadiums to be playing week-in, week-out. I’m excited for it. The way we play it suits us<br /><br />I think things are slowly getting better <b>[in the England squad]</b>. I think the group we’ve got here - the management, the staff - are all heading in the right direction. Nights like the France defeat won’t affect us, it’s what we come here for to try to work on <b>[ourselves]</b>. There’s no need to panic, no need to rush anything. These are little building blocks in place for the World Cup and we’ve more than enough talent to win it.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane believes the Premier League are right to consider closing the summer transfer window before the season starts]</b> I know there have been talks about closing it before the start of the season and I think, for me personally, that would be good. I think once the season starts it would be good for everyone to know where they are at and just start the season.<br /><br />At the minute, players are going here, there and it is maybe hard for some players to concentrate on the start of the season. We will see what happens in the future but my opinion is it would be good to end it when the season starts.<br /><br />I think most clubs, everyone waits until the last minute to see who you can get, to get the best deal and it is understandable. Why wouldn’t teams do that? My opinion is that it probably shouldn’t be open now but it is what it is.<br /><br /><b>[Kane insists that he doesn’t care about the talk of his early season goal droughts]</b> It is something that gets spoken about a lot but I am not too bothered about it. I try to play well for the team and score in every game but sometimes the ball just doesn’t go in. I tried today, off the post, I was unlucky with a few chances that I had. I just have to keep working hard, keep my head down and that’s it, I am sure the goals will come. We are just looking to go again. Another year that we’re playing together, another year that we are working with the manager.<br /><br />Look, we played very well today and it is very frustrating because we should win these games but we didn’t, but that’s football. There’s not much that we can do but keep working hard in training and we have another important game here before the international break. We have got a good squad, you can see today, we have no complaints <b>[with our quality]</b>. It is not like we played badly or that Chelsea were better than us. They had two or three chances and they scored two of them. We had eight or nine and only scored one, so whatever happens in the next couple of weeks we will go from there</p>

I’ve not been in that situation, but if it was shut off before the start of the season, it would help. It would be better if it stopped then, so everyone could focus on the season, without players having to worry about being sold or moving up north or down south.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has rejected Virgil van Dijk’s claim that he dived to win a penalty in Sunday’s 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur]</b> Yeah. <b>[Karius]</b> has dived, he has got in the way and I’m a player, I’m not going to jump out of the way because it’s football. I’ve definitely felt contact and I’ve gone down. For Lamela’s one, I thought the linesman showed amazing character to give that because a lot happened for the first one about the linesman so to give that penalty was massive and it was a penalty.<br /><br />It was a roller coaster of emotions. Obviously getting the first penalty you are thinking ‘I’m going to score the winner’ and then miss it and then it goes down the other end. I’ve got the team down and get another one <b>[penalty]</b> and now I’ve got to step up again. I was delighted to score it and get my 100th goal and delighted to get something out of the game, which I thought we deserved.<br /><br />The first one was essentially what I wanted to do, go down the middle. I have a routine, I went through it and the keeper just stood there and saved it. Sometimes that happens so as a striker you just have to deal with it and hope the next one will come soon. Thankfully it did and I was able to put the second one away<br /><br />That has to be the aim - and hopefully quicker than I got to 100. It is nice, I am going to enjoy the moment, but let’s see how many I can get this year and go from there. Hopefully I can get better and better. I am 24 years old, that’s not young but it’s not old so I’ve still got a lot of learning to do. I feel I am getting more experience year by year and I feel I am getting stronger and more physical and hopefully that just continues. I will always keep trying to work hard and get better and hopefully that will be the case. That is what separates good players from great players: can you do it consistently year after year? Can you get better and better when people don’t expect you to? That’s what I’ve done so far and that is what I will continue to strive to do. That is always my mindset to never let up. It is a short career and I’ll try to do as much as I can in it</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham striker Harry Kane admits being snubbed by Arsenal left him determined to prove a point to them and everybody else]</b> After Arsenal, I bounced around a bit and went back to play for my local team, and then I was spotted by a scout from Watford who offered me a trial. It’s funny how things work out, as it was after playing for Watford against Tottenham that I got the opportunity to join Tottenham’s youth academy. The white kit fit better on me, I think. I remember the first time we played against Arsenal <b>[for Tottenham’s academy team]</b> and even back then, I had a chip on my shoulder. It might sound ridiculous. I was only eight when they let me go, but every time we played them, I thought, ‘Alright, we’ll see who’s right and who’s wrong’. Looking back on it now, <b>[being released by Arsenal]</b> was probably the best thing that ever happened to me because it gave me a drive that wasn’t there before.<br /><br />For me, the rejection is the best thing that ever happened to me. I remember walking round the pitch after the final whistle and clapping to the fans and it felt like, ‘well, I told you so’. We were in the tunnel, and I thought, ‘Okay took me 12 years, but we’ll see who was right and who was wrong. I scored two that day, and the winner in the 86th minute was something that I’d never even dream of visualising before a match. It was a header, probably the best header I’ve ever scored and that feeling when it hit the back of the net, I’ve never felt a rush like that in my whole career. I dreamed of playing for Spurs since I was a boy. For a long time my motivation was simply to close my eyes and picture myself scoring against Arsenal in the Premier League.<br /><br /><b>[The ultimate aim is to close in on 200 goals as quickly as possible]</b> That has to be the aim. Hopefully I can get better and better. I am 24 years old, that’s not young but it’s not old so I’ve still got a lot of learning to do.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane speaks about his best World Cup memories]</b> I’d say his <b>[<a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b>’s penalty against Argentina was my standout memory of watching England at World Cups. My manager now wouldn’t be too happy about that one, but I remember it so clearly. Given all he’d been through after 1998, for him to step up like that and win us such a huge game was a great moment. He was a big role model for me</p>

We need to kill teams off, especially away from home. After the goal we had the high press, we were playing it quicker, moving in behind and punished them when we needed to.

Obviously, when you set standards in other seasons and other games, people will talk if you do not reach them and I am the first to analyse my game and see what I could do better. As a striker, you go through good spells, bad spells. The most important thing for me is to work hard for the team - to do a good shift for the team. I am always pleased to score<br /><br />We all talk around the training ground but there was not an official meeting. We are in a tough spell but that is football.

My whole career I have had to prove people wrong and almost play with a chip on my shoulder. That motivation is just something that’s been inside me, instilled in me: whether it is proving managers or friends or family or fans that I can do this. It’s something that brings the best out of me. I am someone whose dreams go right to the highest level, who wants to go to the highest level, be at the highest level.

It’s an experience I will never, ever, ever forget and neither will the fans or the media, either. Hopefully it’s not the best tournament we have in the next 20 years.

From when it happened, we weren’t in the Champions League final at the time, but it was ‘OK, let’s prepare for if we do get to the Champions League’. The end of the season was going to be too soon to come back and we knew there was a three-week gap after that to give it more time.

Again, in the off season, <b>[I’ll try]</b> to really kind of work on rehab and strengthen it as much as possible.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane says Lifting the Nations League trophy will be a stepping stone for England to go on and achieve even greater success]</b> It’s a new tournament, but it’s still a chance to win a trophy in an England shirt, and 1966 was a long time ago. We’re going to try and take full advantage. We all want to win trophies and have the experience of sharing that with the group and the fans, so it’s a huge incentive. The fans are going to be out in numbers and hopefully be part of history. You want to bring that joy to people - as a footballer that’s what you want to be a part of. I think if we go on and win, it will be another stepping stone to go on to achieve big things in the future. Winning trophies breeds that mentality to go on to do more and more, so it’s a chance for us to start early and try to achieve that.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>, <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> were part of the winning Reds squad, but Kane insists club rivalries are put to one side when everyone meets up on the international stage]</b> We’ve got such a great bond and, although we’re at different clubs, when we come here everyone’s fully focused on here. You don’t have to talk to people about switching off from club football. Everyone just naturally does it and I think the fact we’ve played with each other in club sides and younger England sides (means) we’re all good friends.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane felt fine margins did not go England’s way as they lost 3-1 to Netherlands in the semi-finals of the Nations League]</b> We came out a bit slow in the second half but we managed to step it up again, moved it better and scored a goal we thought was the winner. But there are fine margins in big games like this and it didn’t go our way. Mistakes were made but we learn as a team, take it on the chin and that’s the way we want to play. England also fell at the semi-final stage at the World Cup last year, losing to Croatia in extra time, and Kane accepted England did not cope well enough with Netherlands’ pressure. We made some sloppy mistakes in giving the ball away too easily, they got pressure on us quite high but we have to deal with that. When you come up against good teams, like Croatia at the World Cup, this is what they do and you have to get used to that.<br /><br />Holland are a fantastic team, as were Croatia, and fine margins have decided it again, whether it’s offside or goals from set-pieces.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane credits habits he picked up as a boy as being instrumental in turning him into one of the world’s best strikers]</b> It’s putting in the hard work, first and foremost, and a lot of practice on the training ground. You also need that instinct from a young age - maybe you’re born with it. I think hard work will always override instinct. You see it throughout the years, players who may not technically be as good as others, but at a younger age they work harder, train harder and they get to a higher level because of that. But I think there is an element, especially with top goalscorers, of knowing where the ball is going to fall or being in the right place at the right time<br /><br /><b>[He was given a chance by <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> for the team’s Europa League group stage campaign in 2014]</b> It’s just through habit from doing it when you were a kid scoring goals - you take that with you, maybe without you even knowing. If you add the hard work with that, you become a really good player. Some movements you do on purpose, for example, when you make a cross. Sometimes you do want to move in front to get in behind, even with through balls to come short or go deep, but that’s stuff you can train on</p>

Mike Dean said that he just didn’t know, he couldn’t see, so that’s where the VAR is there to help him out. If he had said ‘no penalty’ and the VAR was a 50-50, then you can agree. But I don’t know what his conversation was with them upstairs, if he said he didn’t see it or not.<br /><br />I’ve watched it back and find it hard to understand how it hasn’t been given. It’s just like if a goalkeeper comes out, uses his arms and trips you up - it’s a penalty. I kind of tripped over his arm and then his body fell into me. Whether it was deliberate or not, from my point of view it’s hard to take. But I said last week <b>[after the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> game]</b> that with VAR sometimes you are going to get the rub of the green, sometimes not.

We didn’t quite have the answers in their box and the final third to get that breakthrough. The decision is the decision but overall we could have done better as a team and it’s just a hard loss to take.

As you’re seeing from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City so far there’s no letting up from them.

To only win two games out of our first seven is not the standards that we’ve set in previous years. Obviously the two draws at <b>[Manchester]</b> City and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are not terrible results, but being 2-0 up at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and drawing does feel like a terrible result. We’ve put ourselves in good positions this season, we just haven’t managed to see the game out or find a way to win like we have in previous years. It’s a disappointing start, but there are plenty of games to turn that around, starting with the game on Saturday <b>[against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b>. <b>[Game management]</b> is something we need to get better at, when we go ahead in games we need to be more confident, to see the game out, whether we drop behind the ball or carry on playing, whatever suits that game. We’re not inexperienced any more, we’re not young any more, the excuses aren’t there for us anymore. It’s down to us players to take responsibility<br /><br />If this was January or February people would be saying there’s no chance of us winning it. Obviously it’s not the ideal start, but stranger things have happened. You can never rule yourselves out until it’s done</p>

I’m still not back training with the first team, but I’m working hard in the gym, I’m getting stronger all the time. We’re talking a few more weeks, and I’ll be playing again. I don’t want to make a prediction for which game I might be back, but I am hoping somewhere between the start and the middle of April</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> striker Harry Kane targets April return while opening up on ‘strange’ coronavirus situation]</b> I’m not too far away, I’d normally hope to be back with the team in two or three weeks’ time. I’m at a good stage, pretty much doing everything, now it’s about building up my fitness. So from my personal point of view, I’m in a good place. It’s such a strange situation, no-one has been in this situation before. Like anything, you have to take the positives out of it and do what you can. So far, me and the family are well, and I’ll continue to work hard, work in the gym, work from home and do what I can. We’ll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />I’m good. From a rehab point of view and personal point of view, I’m doing really well. I’m at a good stage now and just working hard, doing a lot of recovery, a lot of rehab and just waiting to see what happens to the season. Other than that, my family is well, and obviously everyone is thinking about coronavirus at the moment and it’s a time to be together, to stay safe and hopefully everything will be alright</p>

I don’t think you can take that moment away, working as a team and coming together at the end and being champions. I’m sure that will feel a lot better than breaking a record</p>

If the season’s not completed by the end of June we need to look at the options and just look forward to next season<br /><br />There is a plan A, B and C.

The last week or so I have been able to do one-on-one training with one coach on the pitch. It’s a case of getting that feeling back and doing a lot of individual training and finishing</p>

I was at a good stage before the lockdown. I was pretty much doing everything except from training with the team. Since the lockdown’s happened, I’ve continued doing sessions online with the team, a bit of specific work where I do my own stuff for the hamstring and things like that, but pretty much doing everything else the boys are doing. Then obviously the last week or so we’ve been able to go in and do one-on-one training with one member of staff on the pitch. It’s been nice to get out and start touching a ball again.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has declared himself to be fully fit]</b> It has been a funny few months or so having to adapt to the situation, it is great to be back out with the lads, just to feel that team building and get back and competing a little bit more. From the hamstring point of view it is great to be able to give it a bit more rest. I have not played a game for six months now, it has been a long, long time. From an injury point of view I’m normal, I’m fully fit. It will take a while to get back to the team training and feeling that again because I haven’t done that for six months or so. I am feeling food, I am feeling sharp. It has been good to do some individual training, a bit of finishing, a lot of individual drills to work on my game and improve. I am at a stage where I am looking forward to getting some games and hopefully I’ll be back playing before too long.<br /><br />It is a good shock to the system. It has been very intense. I have picked up a few injuries here and there, sometimes people think injuries is the time to rest but it is almost when you’re injured you work harder than before you were injured. It is the first time that I have been able to take my time, re-focus and work on some individual stuff. I have really enjoyed it. Hopefully I’ll be back in a better place before I was injured and look forward to a busy year<br /><br />We have got to finish in the top four, there is no doubt about that. We have got a massive game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the first game and realistically we are going to have to win seven or eight to get into the Champions League. That has got to be our aim. Of course we want to win every game but we have got to make sure we finish strong if we want to be playing Champions League football next season</p>

I can’t wait to get back out there. It’s been long enough without a game, especially when there are top players who are new to the club and you want to be on the pitch with them.

I’m happy to get back on the scoresheet. It was a tough game, it took us a while to break them down. Obviously we had a few chances before we scored the first one, then it was nice to finish it off at the end. When you’ve been out for over six months, it’s getting that feeling back on the pitch. You can train as much as you want, but being out here is totally different. I had a few I probably should have scored - definitely one other - but it was nice to put that one away. I’ve been working very hard all through my rehab, through the lockdown and the warm-up games leading to the first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game. I feel as fit as I’ve ever done before. It’s been a good chance to rest, recover and work on a few things I haven’t been able to over the years. I’m feeling in good shape. I’m someone who, whether I score or not, miss chances, I’m always ready for the next one. I don’t think it bothers me too much. But scoring is one of the best feelings in the world. It’s been a while since I’ve done it. It’s great to get that. We’ve got a little rest now - it’s <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> next in a big game - so hopefully we can continue from this win and take it into the rest of the games.<br /><br />It’s good but it can always be better. Look, 200 games goes so quick. I’ve been playing first-team football now for five or six years and the years just fly by. I’ve got to make the most of it, keep in as good shape as possible. I’m still only 26 and I’ve still got plenty of years to go, so hopefully I can get to that 200 mark sooner rather than later and see where we go from there</p>
