  <p><b>[Tahith Chong is being tipped to reach the very top at Manchester United]</b> Like any young player, my goal is to get into the first team. It’s hard work to get there and that’s what I have to do. At 18, being able to be a part of such a tour was an incredible experience. I had the chance to play with the first team and had players around me trying to help me. My focus was just on learning from them. I’m living the dream. All over the world there are kids who have the ambition to play for United and being there makes me thankful and keen to work as hard as possible. I’m training with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial and, when I train with them, I try to absorb as much as I can because they are world-class players. The best I can do is try to learn from them.<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> He’s a great coach. When I worked with him for the first time, he immediately took the pressure off me. He does this with all the younger players, and from there, the only concern you have to have is to work and learn as much as possible. It’s great to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Tahith Chong is eager to earn more first-team opportunities at Manchester United]</b> It was amazing. I think words cannot describe it sometimes. It was just an amazing experience for me as well. I trained the day before but wasn’t too sure and then, obviously, I got the call so I rang my family and they were just happy as well. It was a proud moment for them as well after all the years I’ve worked, even in Holland and stuff like that. In pre-season, you’re playing friendlies but a Champions League game is completely different preparation. It’s still similar but a bit different because of how big the game is. So it was a different experience for me and a good one as well<br /><br />It was just a case of doing everything what the first team were doing and it’s great to have them around you, talking to you before the game and seeing how they prepare. I think that’s just experience for me. Going up there just makes me want to work harder, whether that’s in the Under-23s or Under-19s, to go harder for the team I’m playing in. That just makes me want more. It’s not only for me but all the younger boys as well. Maybe they can see me go to the bench and see what United is all about - bringing youth through. It’s amazing to see<br /><br />Obviously it was an honour, to be honest, to be called up for the national team and make that step up to the Under-21s. It was a proud moment for me and my family again. It was a big game against Germany and a hard one as they have qualified for the Euros coming up but Holland haven’t. So we went up with a younger group, while they had a full team <b>[Germany won 3-0 in the friendly last month]</b>. So it was hard but a learning experience for us once again. It’s good to see Holland getting back to where we are, especially with younger boys involved. Hopefully, we can get back to where we belong after missing the big tournaments recently, and continue playing well</p>

  <p><b>[Tahith Chong has hailed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for putting his faith in youth]</b> I have got to keep my feet on the ground and keep working hard, if my chances come I have just got to take them. I think the manager he has done a brilliant job. I am not the first one, Angel has had a chance too. For the young boys coming through it is good to see. I think everyone at the youth level now can see those opportunities, everyone is working even harder now<br /><br /><b>[He added on his first United outing]</b> Obviously it was a special moment. I couldn’t enjoy it more than I did. He <b>[Solskjaer]</b> just said enjoy it, get on the ball, try and get a few touches and just enjoy the game. Obviously I just tried to get into the game, get into the tempo. I think it is a proud moment, I just felt proud. You work hard to get there, my family helped me so it was a proud moment just standing there. My parents came, so my mum and dad, so I am happy they could see it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Tahith Chong was all set to sign for Chelsea before Manchester United swooped in and lured him away from a Premier League rival]</b> He had already been tipped by our scouts in Holland and basically I followed him at that tournament and then I followed him all over Europe. Tahith’s parents would be the first to tell you that his form dipped slightly due to growth issues so at that time, so I just held fire. I carried on watching him and realised his form was coming back. He was on the verge of signing for Chelsea and I managed to convince his parents and the boy his future lie at United.</p>

  <p><b>[Tahith Chong has left the door open for a loan move to be made away from Manchester United]</b> <b>[It’s]</b> a difficult question because I don’t think about it now. I only think about United. Everything is possible, I don’t exclude anything. What happens in the future, it happens<br /><br /><b>[On 3-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I had to warm up and suddenly heard a whistle from the trainer. I still can’t describe it. Really fantastic. Of course I can do much better, but it is to be expected that you will not always fall in the way you want in your first big game. The fact that he let me attack PSG also says something about the coach’s confidence in the youth players. It’s great that we could also win the game</p>

That’s nice to hear. There are a few players who left and I’m climbing up the pecking order. It’s always nice to come back to the Netherlands, but in the end I have to do what I find best for myself.

  <p><b>[Tahith Chong says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s youngsters have faced a lot of learning curves this season]</b> All of us really are having a lot of learning curves and are gaining a lot of experience up to now. It has been amazing really and, just thinking about it, being a first-team player is something you dream about. The younger lads are coming up as well, so it’s really good. Training is a different level as well now. Definitely, the training and the games are tougher, stuff like that, as you progress, but you keep training and keep playing games and you’ll get there. You start getting used to the tempo of the game and, like I’ve said, it’s been a good experience for us<br /><br /><b>[Asked how he adapts to the pace of first-team football when coming off the subs’ bench]</b> It is one of the things you get used to. The tempo coming into the game as well. The tempo is already there and it’s: ‘Okay, now I’m coming on, I’ve got to get used to it and get into the game straight away’. It’s all a learning experience and I’m really enjoying it. Obviously, it depends on the game really and how the game is going, stuff like that, but your instructions are based on how the game is going. Every game has different instructions. The manager tells you, as well, to go out there and enjoy your game and do what you’re good at</p>
