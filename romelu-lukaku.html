I hadn’t experienced that before. Even when I make a good pass, if the ball bobbles a little bit, he pulls me up on it. I think he sees in me characteristics he also had when he was younger. That’s why he’s so intransigent with me. Thanks to him, I’m more intelligent in my movement, and so I’m caught offside less. He’s also teaching me things about finishing, controlling the ball and how I see the game. Back in the day, he made ten assists a season, I’d like to emulate him</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has hit out at Manchester United for not doing enough to protect him in the media and claims he, Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez were continually made scapegoats]</b> They have to find somebody. It is Pogba, it is me or it is Alexis. It’s the three of us all the time. They have got to find somebody to blame. I put my hand up, like, this year I don’t think I was the only one playing bad. A lot of people were playing bad but they had to find the culprit. If they want to put the blame on me, you know what, f<strong>* it, do what you gotta do. I think the team has so much potential to do some great stuff. There is a lot of talent. But it is not only talent; you really have to build a team<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku also took issue with suggestions he did not suit Solskjaer’s intended style of play]</b> A lot of people don’t think I should be part of that system. That’s my feeling from the conversations that I have. I just know. For me, the thing that makes me laugh a lot is: how the hell is s</strong>* going bad in my team, but when I play in my national team, it’s good? And I’m happy. I didn’t play the last six weeks of the league, like the last three weeks or something before the end of the season and then I had another three weeks off before I had to play for the national team, and then we go and play with the Belgium team. And nobody there complains because I think the perception in my country is changing slightly. A lot of people were saying a lot of stuff. For me, it took years for a lot of people to change their perception. Man U might not get that time. It’s s<strong>* that it happens like that<br /><br />When I go and play for my country, we play the style of play that we want to play probably with Man United and I do well over there. So is it me? Four goals in the World Cup, three weeks ago I scored three goals in two games, and before that we played Switzerland and Iceland in September and I scored four goals in two games. I’ve scored 48 goals for my country. We all know that international soccer is different than club football but the playing style we play in the national team is the one we want to play at Man United. So is it me? Or do we need to have a conversation from man to man and tell each other the rules?<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku added that he felt United did not do enough to defend him]</b> I think a lot of stuff has been said where I didn’t feel protected. A lot of rumours, ‘Rom is going to go there, they don’t want Rom’ and nobody came out and shot it down. It was for a good three, four weeks. I’m waiting for someone to come out and shut it down. It didn’t happen. I had my conversation, told them it was better to go our separate ways. I just wanted you to say, ‘Rom is going to fight for his place’, but it never happened for four, five months. It was all, ‘He’s got to go, he doesn’t deserve to be there’. Well, okay, then I want to go now. There is fighting for your position, but also being somewhere that people want you to be. If you’re happy, you find a way, it doesn’t matter if you’re on the bench or starting. But nobody told me that was the situation, so I thought for two, three weeks to analyse, see all this s</strong>* coming out in the media. Who leaks it? Not me. Not my agent. I see it on my phone come out of nowhere. I told them, ‘It’s not good for me to be at a place where I’m not wanted’</p>

I was looking for an apartment, an apartment for my mum to stay in close to the practice facility, so I don’t have to drive too far. And then Man U came. At Man U everybody was… I felt the trust more, where everybody wanted me to be there and that’s the true story. People say ‘Yeah, my agent <b>[Mino Raiola]</b>’ and stuff like that - my former agent at the time - he did his job, he got the best opportunity for me, but the people wanted me the most and that was Man U. Everybody was wanting me. There was no doubting. They came and they told me - I was in New York - I get a phone call from this number and I’m like, ‘Who’s this?’ Pick up, Jose Mourinho. ‘Rom, how are you doing?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, what’s up, boss?’. ‘I’m gonna get you back, we’re gonna pay £75m plus £15m in bonuses by next week, so I expect you in LA. So go and do your s*** in LA and I’ll see you after <b>[in pre-season]</b>’. I felt the dude was lying, like ‘I’ll see you’. Then the next thing I know, I wake up and had to go back to Everton on the July 7 and July 6, I wake up in the morning and I see they’ve agreed the deal, so I’m like, ‘Man! They came in hard!<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku added on linking back up with Mourinho]</b> When <b>[I was at United]</b>, I remember we were in Moscow two years ago, we played CSKA, I told him, ‘Yo man, I wanted to kill your arse so bad’ and we laughed about it. Me and Jose our relationship is… everybody has their own personal relationship with him, but me and him we bump heads. We bump heads, but I love him as a man. I think he loves me as a man, but we bump heads all the time. All the time. He might be picking on me, but then I’ll be picking on him. But he’s my guy, for sure, he’s my guy</p>

When I arrived, the first four days were about building up the physical aspect, getting as fit as possible for the first game - do a lot of physical work and adapt tactically to what he (Conte) wants on the pitch.

  <p><b>[Lukaku describes life in isolation]</b> I almost went crazy one day. I can’t go out, I can’t go shopping. I’m locked up in the house. I miss everyday life, being with my mom, with my son and brother. I’m with my physiotherapist, they bring me food every day. At noon lunch arrives on time, I eat fish and vegetables. They provided me with an exercise bike. I asked in our group chat who had one at home and after two hours they brought one to each of us<br /><br />You have to be careful. My mom, for example, has diabetes, so I can’t even go home and touch her<br /><br />The <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> were my favorite team as a child thanks to <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="christian-vieri.html">Christian Vieri</a>, with whom I now have an excellent relationship. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> already wanted me at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I have never had any doubts and since I arrived in Milan I have concentrated on training and on returning to the best form.</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku on life at Inter]</b> We’re good. Working hard. I’m running around after my son. It’s just difficult, I miss the competitiveness, the training sessions, playing in front of the fans, that’s the most difficult thing. Being competitive with another team.<br /><br /><b>[On trying to improve his game at Inter]</b> Right now it’s a moment for me to analyse my game and see what I’ve done in the last six months and to take it forward and add something else to my game. That’s the plan. I want to be everything. I told you (Henry) that four years ago, that was one of the first conversations in the national team. I said I want to be a guy that has double figures in goals and assists so step-by-step it’s coming. Twenty five <b>[goals]</b>, 10 <b>[assists]</b> would be nice. 20 <b>[goals]</b>, 20 <b>[assists]</b> is not easy… I need Lautaro or <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> to do me a big favour. But they’re already working well with me, we’re exchanging really well. It doesn’t matter who I play with up front. When you mature it’s not only about yourself anymore. Obviously scoring goals is my thing, my drug, it’s what I live for but the older you get you have to use your intelligence as well because I always say I’m a student of the game. If I want to help my team I have to also be capable of giving assists because it cannot only be me. It has to be the guy next to you. Everybody has to feel important. If I can’t shoot myself I will always try to find the last pass. When we do the analysis of the game, when we shoot from positions where we don’t have to shoot from he (Conte) stops the clip and then he says ‘look, the big player finds the pass’<br /><br />It all started on the first day when I got there at Inter. Me speaking Spanish helped because then on the field straight away we knew left, right. I asked him ‘what do you like from your partner?’ I said to him ‘when I get the ball I like my partner to move quickly around me and be dynamic as well because that’s the way the coach wants us to play’. It helps me because some games I have to play more like a target man and then he will help me more with these movements and some games we both have to be dynamic and run into the space. The way we work in training is that every day we do video analysis of the way we work so it’s rare we will make the same mistake the next day. He (Conte) will show it in the video before training so he expects in the session that we don’t make the same mistakes. If you have a manager who’s on you like that every day, it can only be good. I’m 26, I always think about improving and getting better so I don’t mind<br /><br />It was my team in Italy when I was a kid <b>[because of]</b> R9, <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>. So for me it’s like a dream <b>[to join Inter]</b>. R9 was playing there when I was like six or seven. 1998 was my first memory of football. The <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup final they played, the World Cup, and then R9 got injured, he missed two years then he came back 2002 but then he went to Madrid. And then it was you (Henry), <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>. What <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> did at that time I think, man</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku questions delay to suspend <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> following coronavirus outbreak]</b> Health comes first. Why should we play if there are people in the world who are risking their lives? Why was it only necessary for a player to test positive in order for football to stop? It’s not normal. I will admit that I do miss football, but now the most important thing is people’s health. Everything else comes secondary to that<br /><br />What I miss most is competing with opponents, being in full stadiums and feeling the support from the fans. I am using this time to analyse my performances and indeed, more generally, everything I have done in the last six months.

With <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the intensity and the power of the game is really up there. But tactically in Italy, I think you get a little more tested. It is not as easy to score a goal as people think, every game you have to prepare and play in a different way. Both of these leagues are really good; every league has its strengths and it’s nice for me to discover a different league. I love both Italy and England, both countries have been very welcoming to me<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku wasn’t quite as kind when Inter team-mate <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a> entered into the comment section, jokingly calling the Belgian ‘ugly’]</b> You are uglier than me!

  <p><b>[Lukaku claims Inter squad had coronavirus symptoms in December]</b> We had a week off in December, we returned to work and I swear that 23 out of 25 players were ill. I am not kidding. We played against <a href="radja-nainggolan.html">Radja Nainggolan</a>’s <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> and after about 25 minutes, one of our defenders had to leave the pitch. He could not continue and almost fainted<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku said of the game against Cagliari]</b> Everyone was coughing and had a fever. When I was warming up, I felt a lot hotter than usual. I hadn’t suffered from a fever in years. After the game there was a planned dinner with guests from Puma, but I thanked them and went straight to bed. We never did the Covid-19 tests at that moment, so we’ll never know for sure<br /><br />We’ve got seven players who all live in the same street. The difference with England is enormous, as there we’d go out to dinner about once every four months, whereas here it’s every four weeks<br /><br />I dream of ending at Anderlecht, so the circle will be closed and I will have been a professional footballer for 20 years. Then I would like to travel and let it all go. I will never become a commentator, but now I am taking a training course. Who knows, maybe I will become a coach</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku explains how <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> &amp; <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> made him a star]</b> Everything happened quickly there. I was only 18 years old, I had just finished high school three months earlier, I had graduated and suddenly I was already on the train to London. There I met <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, he was doing physiotherapy. He told me immediately that I had to show him the ‘Blue’ character. From that day on we started talking every day for at least an hour, before training, after training. He, <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> and every other player in that locker room showed me what it takes to become the person I am today. It wasn’t so much the coach as the players, they had a mentality that made them say ‘OK, let’s go win’. It was a great experience, I saw how they won the Champions League, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and this has served me well so far<br /><br />A man on a mission. I didn’t realise it during the World Cup in Russia, I was a bit euphoric, we got to the semi-finals and we’re talking about a small country with only 11 million inhabitants. The pain came a month later when I reviewed all the videos from the World Cup. That was difficult, because you think you really came close. And that only hit me afterwards</p>

He thought everyone should come along, including the ones who were suspended and the few boys who were not in the Champions League squad. I am also grateful to him for that.<br /><br />This win is one of the things I’ve always dreamed about. You want to celebrate something like that with the team at that time. That is nice in itself at the age of 19. I am happy for the whole club, but there is one man who took a lot from me: the previous trainer (Villas-Boas). I will never forgive him for that<br /><br />I didn’t touch it with a finger. Because I didn’t win this trophy myself. This has been the case since I was 11: if I have not contributed anything, it is not my trophy. Only if you have contributed to a cup or a title yourself, you can also show it off<br /><br />Once I had to play in the front left, another time in the front right. You don’t develop that way. Then at some point you have to think about yourself. So I told the club what I thought of it. I know <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a> was also under pressure, but that’s why he didn’t have to treat me like that. <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a> approached me completely differently, he immediately involved me in everything.
