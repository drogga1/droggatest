  <p><b>[Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku talks about <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s influence on him as assistant coach of Les Diables Rouges]</b> It’s not easy with him, he’s very demanding. I hadn’t experienced that before. Even when I make a good pass, if the ball bobbles a little bit, he pulls me up on it. I think he sees in me characteristics he also had when he was younger. That’s why he’s so intransigent with me. Thanks to him, I’m more intelligent in my movement, and so I’m caught offside less. He’s also teaching me things about finishing, controlling the ball and how I see the game. Back in the day, he made ten assists a season, I’d like to emulate him</p>

For me, I have to keep on going as well as I can. If you look at the best players in the world they are constantly improving. I don’t want to peak too early, I want to keep getting better year after year.<br /><br />I’m working harder, I run more. I think that’s been first of all, I got more consistency and the manager wanted me to do more on the pitch as well. I think for me it’s been good, a nice journey and I’m learning a lot. I feel much better in my skin the way we’re playing now and I want to keep on improving like the rest of the team has to do<br /><br />The best we can do as Everton is show to everybody that we are growing as a club which will fight to win titles because every player, every manager has ambitions in football, I think that’s normal. If you don’t have ambition, stop playing football and stop life because you need ambitions to get the best out of yourself. As Everton, we need to show all the players that we are growing and we will finally win titles but I understand players wanting to play in the Champions League, it’s a normal ambition and we will see what will happen with Romelu and other players</p>

The season isn’t over yet and we want to do even better than we are already doing.<br /><br />Hard work, continuous hard work and dedication. I give my best every day in training and in games; this is the only way that I know how to play football. I always want to win and that’s the same with my team-mates. At the moment, we are doing really well and we need to continue like this. Physically we’ve been working really hard this year and I feel my fitness levels have been improving throughout the year. I ensure I am focused throughout the game whether that is making a chance for myself or receiving the ball from a teammate to score. I think I’ve proven that I’ve improved every part of my game. I have always been scoring goals and now the quality of goals I am scoring is better. I can now create chances to score for myself, and I have scored a free kick this year too. I have been scoring a lot more headers and my overall finishing has improved a lot. My overall play has improved but I want to give a lot more as I go through my journey in football</p>

Not even face-to-face because <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> is not here. I see Zlatan as important for the team. I just say that my squad is better for sure, he is one more option, he is one more striker, he is one more experienced player, he is one more player that can play nine or 10, that can play double strikers or no, there are lots of matches to play.<br /><br />If we progress in the Champions League and if we progress in one of the cups, I don’t even say both, if we do that we are going to be in the position where we couldn’t do it only with Lukaku and Rashford, especially if I play both together, because if I play one and the other one is on the bench, okay, but I am playing with both?<br /><br />So if I play with both, I need a striker, so probably in January I would be knocking on Ed Woodward’s door asking for a striker for the second part of the season and I don’t need to.

I had a good time. I learned my trade over there. I am really grateful to the club no matter what happened. But now I am in a team where we want to win against the big teams and we want to win every game, so I think the situation will change. I don’t put pressure on myself. I think the biggest pressure game for me was the Super Cup against Real Madrid. That was the game for me where everybody was looking at me and thinking will he do it there. I think it freed me from everything.<br /><br />A lot of strikers in the league miss bigger chances than me and they score two goals - but with me it’s always ‘Rom did this, Rom did that’, I don’t know why. It’s the standard people set. People will always say this and that, but my record in the Premier League is pretty good and I’m in a situation where the team is performing really well.

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has revealed that his dream of working with Jose Mourinho helped to make a £75 million move to Manchester United a reality]</b> Because before I had a dream of playing for the manager, Jose Mourinho. When I was little, at age of 11, I was at Chelsea. I was talking to my mum and dad that I wanted to play for him, because I really like his personality as a manager. He won many titles for Chelsea and Porto and now I’m very happy that I work with him. Because he’s a manager who knows what he needs to do to win the match and with him I learn a lot..<br /><br />Next up is to win titles. It’s the ambition of the club, it is my ambition as well, to be a great player in the history of football. And win more titles. This for me is very important, for me it is a child’s dream, and now I will do everything to fulfil this dream</p>

At the end of the day I just try and help my team-mates out and try win matches.<br /><br />As long as the manager wants to use me I will do my best to help the team out. We have a number of injuries, we have to stay positive, have that positive mentality. We are Manchester United and you have to go wherever we go and win. Roy Hodgson will set up his Palace team really well. We know that. We will prepare and we need to recover properly because <b>[Sunday]</b> was a physical game.

For me, the thing that makes me laugh a lot is: how the hell is shit going bad in my team, but when I play in my national team, it’s good? And I’m happy. I didn’t play the last six weeks of the league, like the last three weeks or something before the end of the season and then I had another three weeks off before I had to play for the national team, and then we go and play with the Belgium team. And nobody there complains because I think the perception in my country is changing slightly. A lot of people were saying a lot of stuff. For me, it took years for a lot of people to change their perception. Man U might not get that time. It’s shit that it happens like that<br /><br />When I go and play for my country, we play the style of play that we want to play probably with Man United and I do well over there. So is it me? Four goals in the World Cup, three weeks ago I scored three goals in two games, and before that we played Switzerland and Iceland in September and I scored four goals in two games. I’ve scored 48 goals for my country. We all know that international soccer is different than club football but the playing style we play in the national team is the one we want to play at Man United. So is it me? Or do we need to have a conversation from man to man and tell each other the rules?<br /><br /><b>[Lukaku added that he felt United did not do enough to defend him]</b> I think a lot of stuff has been said where I didn’t feel protected. A lot of rumours, ‘Rom is going to go there, they don’t want Rom’ and nobody came out and shot it down. It was for a good three, four weeks. I’m waiting for someone to come out and shut it down. It didn’t happen. I had my conversation, told them it was better to go our separate ways. I just wanted you to say, ‘Rom is going to fight for his place’, but it never happened for four, five months. It was all, ‘He’s got to go, he doesn’t deserve to be there’. Well, okay, then I want to go now. There is fighting for your position, but also being somewhere that people want you to be. If you’re happy, you find a way, it doesn’t matter if you’re on the bench or starting. But nobody told me that was the situation, so I thought for two, three weeks to analyse, see all this shit coming out in the media. Who leaks it? Not me. Not my agent. I see it on my phone come out of nowhere. I told them, ‘It’s not good for me to be at a place where I’m not wanted’</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku: <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> told me I was trash in front of Inter stars]</b> I remember one of my first Champions League games against Slavia Prague when I played really bad - like I was trash that day - and I really got it from him in front of the whole team. He told me that I was really trash and that he would take me off after five minutes if I would have done it again.<br /><br />It’s little things like that. And we played the Milan derby just after that and I played one of my best games of the season. He just gave me that - he stepped on my confidence but it woke me up at the same time. He does it to everybody, it doesn’t matter who you are. Everybody is equal. It had never really happened to me before. It had never happened.

I made my decision around March, and I went to the manager’s office and told him it was time for me to find something else. I wasn’t performing and I wasn’t playing. I think it was better for both sides to go separate ways. I think I made the right decision. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> has made space for the younger players to come through so I think it was a win-win situation for both of us</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku on life at Inter]</b> We’re good. Working hard. I’m running around after my son. It’s just difficult, I miss the competitiveness, the training sessions, playing in front of the fans, that’s the most difficult thing. Being competitive with another team.<br /><br /><b>[On trying to improve his game at Inter]</b> Right now it’s a moment for me to analyse my game and see what I’ve done in the last six months and to take it forward and add something else to my game. That’s the plan. I want to be everything. I told you (Henry) that four years ago, that was one of the first conversations in the national team. I said I want to be a guy that has double figures in goals and assists so step-by-step it’s coming. Twenty five <b>[goals]</b>, 10 <b>[assists]</b> would be nice. 20 <b>[goals]</b>, 20 <b>[assists]</b> is not easy… I need Lautaro or <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> to do me a big favour. But they’re already working well with me, we’re exchanging really well. It doesn’t matter who I play with up front. When you mature it’s not only about yourself anymore. Obviously scoring goals is my thing, my drug, it’s what I live for but the older you get you have to use your intelligence as well because I always say I’m a student of the game. If I want to help my team I have to also be capable of giving assists because it cannot only be me. It has to be the guy next to you. Everybody has to feel important. If I can’t shoot myself I will always try to find the last pass. When we do the analysis of the game, when we shoot from positions where we don’t have to shoot from he (Conte) stops the clip and then he says ‘look, the big player finds the pass’<br /><br />It all started on the first day when I got there at Inter. Me speaking Spanish helped because then on the field straight away we knew left, right. I asked him ‘what do you like from your partner?’ I said to him ‘when I get the ball I like my partner to move quickly around me and be dynamic as well because that’s the way the coach wants us to play’. It helps me because some games I have to play more like a target man and then he will help me more with these movements and some games we both have to be dynamic and run into the space. The way we work in training is that every day we do video analysis of the way we work so it’s rare we will make the same mistake the next day. He (Conte) will show it in the video before training so he expects in the session that we don’t make the same mistakes. If you have a manager who’s on you like that every day, it can only be good. I’m 26, I always think about improving and getting better so I don’t mind<br /><br />It was my team in Italy when I was a kid <b>[because of]</b> R9, <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>. So for me it’s like a dream <b>[to join Inter]</b>. R9 was playing there when I was like six or seven. 1998 was my first memory of football. The <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup final they played, the World Cup, and then R9 got injured, he missed two years then he came back 2002 but then he went to Madrid. And then it was you (Henry), <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>. What <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> did at that time I think, man</p>
