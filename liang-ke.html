<blockquote>
  <p>[On Paulinho gifts Mercedes-Benz to driver following €40m Barcelona switch] Paulinho never put on any airs. He says hello or thank you to almost everybody and always meets the needs of others. He is reluctant to receive any money, instead, he loves giving. For example, he gave his pair of Beats headphones and [Mercedes-Benz] car to his driver. His gesture of goodwill is not determined by his high salary. There are tons of people who are richer than Paulinho, but few are as generous and broadminded as him.<br /><br />[Liang added on the South American’s time in Asia] Paulinho brought a private podiatrist from Brazil along with him after joining Evergrande. After noticing the maladjustment suffered by his podiatrist, Paulinho invited the podiatrist’s wife and children to come here and covered the entire expense. Paulinho paid tuition fees for the podiatrist’s children after helping them enrol in an international school. He also paid medical bills before one of the children undergoes a surgical procedure. Paulinho even provided plane tickets and five-star accommodation if the podiatrist’s family fancy travelling to watch his away games. Have you ever met another employer as good as Paulinho?<br /><br />Paulinho secretly wears a ‘FORÇA CHAPE’ armband to support Chapecoense despite his application for wearing the armband being rejected by officials</p>
