  <p><b>[Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams has signed a new nine-year contract with the Spanish club amid rumours that he was a transfer target for Manchester United]</b> I’m very happy. I am proud to be tied to this great club that has given me everything. I’ve always said that I’m where I want to be, I’m very happy in Bilbao. I’m very happy at Athletic Club and I just have to show it with work, effort and above all trying to help the team with goals. The club has given me everything, I feel it is my home. I only have words of gratitude<br /><br /><b>[Williams also set his sights on pushing ahead with his hometown club and progressing their standing]</b> Thank you for supporting me. Above all for always being with me in bad times. It’s a day to enjoy to be happy and hopefully great things can come because what I want to make this club bigger if possible. This, as you can see, is my house, and all I want I have it here. I’m very proud to be part of Athletic</p>

My number one option has always been to stay at Athletic Club and to retire here. Joining <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>? No, I could never go there. 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Inaki Williams says he is saddened to have been targeted by alleged racist abuse during his side’s 1-1 <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> draw at Espanyol on Saturday]</b> I’m sad because of the draw but above all because I suffered racist insults. No black player or any player wants to hear that. It’s completely out of order. People should go to matches to enjoy themselves and support their team<br /><br />It is very sad that today we continue to see racism in football. We have to end it among EVERYONE. Thanks for your support. #SayNoToRacism</p>
