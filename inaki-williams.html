  <p><b>[Inaki Williams says he wants to remain at Athletic Bilbao beyond the current campaign]</b> The first thing I would do is talk to the president. Lots of things are coming out in the news but I am calm. If <b>[clubs]</b> are looking at me it’s because I’m doing things well. I’m very lucky. If tomorrow I had to leave I would always be very honest with Athletic. They’ve given me everything. Staying put is my first option right now though.<br /><br />I love this club, my team-mates and the city. I’m happy in Bilbao. Same for my family</p>

  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga is set to hand Athletic Bilbao a boon]</b> There’s a lot been said but he’s still with us. He is focused on recovering as soon as possible and we see that he’s very calm. From time to time, we can hesitate when there are rumours in the press, but everything has been kept between friends. Everyone wants him to stay - it would be good news for us. The truth is that we want to have the best players on our side</p>

  <p><b>[Athletic Club vs Barcelona]</b> Barca are a very complicated opponent, very difficult. We are aware that they have the best player in the world and other very good ones, but we have more than enough weapons and we have always put them in trouble. We have to be very close to them based on the fact that it will be very difficult to steal the ball from them. We must take advantage of our chances and have confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams has signed a new nine-year contract with the Spanish club amid rumours that he was a transfer target for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I’m very happy. I am proud to be tied to this great club that has given me everything. I’ve always said that I’m where I want to be, I’m very happy in Bilbao. I’m very happy at Athletic Club and I just have to show it with work, effort and above all trying to help the team with goals. The club has given me everything, I feel it is my home. I only have words of gratitude<br /><br /><b>[Williams also set his sights on pushing ahead with his hometown club and progressing their standing]</b> Thank you for supporting me. Above all for always being with me in bad times. It’s a day to enjoy to be happy and hopefully great things can come because what I want to make this club bigger if possible. This, as you can see, is my house, and all I want I have it here. I’m very proud to be part of Athletic</p>

  <p><b>[Inaki Williams says he is saddened to have been targeted by alleged racist abuse during his side’s 1-1 <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> draw at Espanyol on Saturday]</b> I’m sad because of the draw but above all because I suffered racist insults. No black player or any player wants to hear that. It’s completely out of order. People should go to matches to enjoy themselves and support their team<br /><br />It is very sad that today we continue to see racism in football. We have to end it among EVERYONE. Thanks for your support. #SayNoToRacism</p>
