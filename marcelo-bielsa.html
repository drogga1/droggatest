The level of the team has always been the same, the effort has always been the same. Of course the team has limits … This team has hidden many limits with huge effort. With personality, and by being demanding. Each player has played very close to his maximum during many games</p>

The club are not responsible whatsoever. The person who did it followed my orders. Many condemned me saying it was immoral, unethical and violated fair play. Some say it was cheating. The club felt obliged to make public excuses to Derby. I assume the fact that my behaviour is observed. I observed all the rivals and we watched all the training sessions of the opponents before we played against them. It’s not a violation of law. We can discuss if it’s right or wrong. I didn’t have bad intentions nor did I try and get an unfair sporting advantage<br /><br /><b>[The ultimate disciplinary course of action involved a fine of £200,000 ($260k).

  <p><b>[Bielsa admits <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s tactics are a mystery]</b> The argument I give to explain my respect and admiration for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is that the beauty of the play of the teams he built you can’t copy. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> builds alpha teams. We always said ‘what would <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> do without the players he had in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?’ and you can say the players of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are unique.

I’m underlining his capacity to be creative. The things you can’t analyse are a mystery for those who don’t know about them. When I watch <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> games I feel I’m ignorant. You have a picture where 10 players are in front of their own box and City move the ball, trying to find the space to put the ball in. I see what is well done and try to copy it and understand it. But you can’t copy <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s teams. When I see it I’m wondering ‘what’s the method? What do we have to repeat to do that? What are the pre-established needs to solve this compact defence?’ But you never find out. They always find a solution.</p>

You know about this process, that’s why I’m talking about it. If the club offers me the possibility to carry on I will listen to this proposal. You just have to accept the pain. I feel very sad first of all for the players. I don’t think that there’s someone who feels more pain than our players. And I also feel sad for the pain of the fans because I know it’s a big pain. This is a responsibility that I have to assume. We are very disappointed. It’s not necessary to analyse. The natural thing in the first half is we should have finished with two goals more, but we finished with a draw and in the second half it’s a game that broke immediately. The chances of the opponent ended in goals and our’s not. It’s meaningless explaining that we had as many chances as the opponent in the second half and in the first we had more chances and should have made a difference</p>

Finally, this contact never happened. I understand perfectly why it was like this but honestly, I would like to be part of the football of this country. The country could be dangerous because finally their football is growing. They are at an age in football that will give the national team a chance to get success<br /><br /><b>[Having narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League last season, Bielsa is determined for Leeds to go one better in this coming campaign]</b> If we can improve what we made last season obviously we can arrive at the goal we want to achieve.

This for any manager is a big achievement. For me, it’s more important because the team that played the final of the Champions League was a team he built very carefully. The performance of this team was linked to the collective play built between him and his players rather than top players bought for them. They didn’t buy top players.

In 15 days he will be at the top again because when you see the things from afar, after you can see what you realise what he really achieved.

It’s just a matter of time and after that he will show those skills. He has showed them clearly and after that the price is linked to what he has shown on the pitch.

  <p><b>[Bielsa’s philosophy dictates that his teams relentlessly press the opposition in order to win the ball back as early as possible]</b> My football in defence is very simple: ‘we run all the time’. It’s basically playing 11 v 11 with no stops. Constantly running around and sprinting, and you have all the coaches on the pitch basically screaming all the time and basically you can’t stop running. It’s just a normal game with normal rules, 11 v 11 on a big pitch. You just play, but you can’t stop running. It’s tough, but it’s the most important session in the week. It depends on the training how long he wants us to play. It could be five times six minutes, or one times 20 minutes. It just depends what Marcelo wants. Even if the ball goes out, there’s a member of staff waiting with another ball to put it in. You can’t stop.</p>
