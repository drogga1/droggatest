  <p><b>[Leeds United have confirmed the appointment of former Argentina and Marseille boss Marcelo Bielsa as their new manager on a two-year contract]</b> I am delighted to accept the role of head coach at Leeds United. It has always been my ambition to work in England and I have had several opportunities to do so during my career. However, I have always felt it was important to wait for the right project to come along and so when a club with Leeds United’s history made me an offer, it was impossible to turn down. I am excited for the challenge ahead and I look forward to collaborating with Victor, Andrea and Angus, as we work hard to achieve great things at this football club.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcelo Bielsa is pleased the time for talking is over]</b> I think that I am in a place that is bigger than what I deserve. I hope you don’t take this as a compliment for the owners of the club. My goal is to show I deserve this opportunity I was given, but to show you I’m not a demagogue, think about the manner to make this successful project. Think about the big challenge I have this year as a head coach and you will easily understand I can’t think about my future. When I speak I try not to please people. When I speak I try not to lie, I try to tell the truth and sometimes it’s hard not to be ‘something’.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed again to outline his vision for the Whites]</b> I already explained them, but not very well because I already answered this question. I will try again. I want to be a protagonist and I don’t want to speculate. I want to play in the opponent’s side. I like my team to attack, not defend. I take the risk to attack in small spaces and defend in big spaces. I prefer players who have creativity rather than players who don’t have this profile. I accept the risk you take when you build from the back, but for each of my affirmations there is an opposite possibility. I accept it and understand it is a valid one.<br /><br />I wouldn’t criticise a team that would clear the ball, play long balls, I wouldn’t criticise teams who play speculating, I wouldn’t criticise other teams for waiting and not attacking, I wouldn’t criticise any team that plays hard instead of creating, but what I like is what I just said. It doesn’t mean my philosophy is the best one. It’s the philosophy I can transmit. Of course this has to be deeply rooted in respect for the rules. Sometimes the rules offer some aspect you can use to the advantage. I would rather consider the rules as a protection for creative football. My first answer would have been enough, but I explain this as a special attention for you and I apologise for all the people who had to listen again.<br /><br />The rules say we have to end after half an hour because after 30 minutes the attention decreases, so please don’t feel bored</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds vs Stoke City]</b> We always imagine we will have a hard game. We have the ingredients of a game - it’s the first game of the season and it’s a home game. The opponent has to change the dynamic of their squad. Stoke are a strong rival, but it would be risky to say it’s the most important rival before the season because sometimes what we imagine before the season starts doesn’t occur. We want to impose our style, one idea. Our idea is to play in the opponent’s half and that means we will dominate our opponent if we impose this idea. Our idea is to attack more than to defend, and if we defend the goal it is to attack as soon again as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa says he has had to omit some players from his plans for this season]</b> When a professional player has a history as a football player, for example Vurnon Anita, Eunan O’Kane and Caleb Ekuban have history, one way to respect them is to keep them inside the team if they have the possibility to play in another position. If we have one position and three players it’s very difficult that the third player in the position gets time to play. I saw every game and every minute that they played last year and I also listened to the opinion of the club.<br /><br />If you haven’t trained a player it’s a deficit to make a decision. We then built a group where we have two players for each position and if we had acted in another way it would have been counterproductive. For example, I have Ayling, Dallas and Shackleton, because Shackleton is a youngster who has time to develop in his career, but I can’t do the same thing with Ayling, Dallas and Anita. I would be doing something not very good to one of the three players, so when you take decisions you have to transmit them at the right moment and I think this is an honest behaviour<br /><br />Of course, I can make mistakes but I don’t want to make any mistakes. For example, I can say that because of Dallas’ injury it could have been a good thing to have Anita with us, it would have been better for me but I think it would be unfair to keep a player with us if he doesn’t have the possibility to get the time he deserves</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United vs Rotherham]</b> Their style is different. It’s not the same as the first two opponents. They play long balls to the strikers and they don’t play with ball on the ground. This is the main difference but it doesn’t mean it’s going to be like that. It’s very hard to implement a style of play. It’s not easy. It becomes more difficult if you are not consistent and don’t respect your style of play. We will take into account the style of the opponent but we will play as we have done so far. If you think that we are favourites, you’re supposing that we should feel superior to our opponent or that our opponent should feel inferior to us. These things are never decided before the game. It’s better to demonstrate it than to say it. But regarding our team, before playing we never think we are inferior to any other team.</p>

Everyone knows what you can see from our profession which is that thinking ahead to the next match without having played the previous, never has good consequences. This is a team with enough experience to have taken that on board.<br /><br />Reading is a team that has a greater potential than its position in the league table would suggest. They have fast striker and good midfielders on the left and right wings. They have a physically strong defence and use the ball well</p>

Of course we are reaching the final of this competition, so every game becomes more important. What we have done so far is important too, because it allows us to be in this position now. Teams talk about the head coach that they have and the team says a lot about the head coach they have. I have learned a lot from Sheffield United this season, they have a new style of play they have been faithful to their style all season, each player is giving the best of himself. One of the features of Sheffield is that they attack without stopping defending and defend without stopping attacking. When we won against them it was a hard win and probably we didn’t deserve to win and for us it is a big challenge to play against them and try and win the game. Our goal is to overcome Sheffield and win against them</p>

The level of the team has always been the same, the effort has always been the same. Of course the team has limits … This team has hidden many limits with huge effort.

If you are a manager, you have more media <b>[attention]</b>; if you are an assistant, you have less. When <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> play more matches, we are going to see more of the manager. In three matches, all he can do is try to get results.

  <p><b>[Bielsa backs <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> ahead of FA Cup reunion]</b> Pepe is a great player with big talent and is a goalscorer. And he’s a player who is able to unbalance a match. Obvious skills, then you have all of these skills in one player, the value is £72m. It’s just a matter of time and after that he will show those skills. He has showed them clearly and after that the price is linked to what he has shown on the pitch. One thing is to have the skills, another is to have the skills and show it on the pitch. He does both. He has clearly shown his skills and is at a club he deserves to be at</p>

  <p><b>[Social media was full of praise for Bielsa and his side as they took the game to their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> opponents right from the first whistle]</b> We wanted to beat them. We should have played with much more balance. What we needed to do in the match is repeat what we did in the first half. The first half of the team was very, very positive for us. In the second half the control of the match changed a lot. In the first half we pressed the opponents’ defence more and were able to attack fast. We couldn’t do that in the second half</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> extended their lead at the top of Championship but by only one point after being held 1-1 at home against relegation battlers Luton]</b> What Luton did was right. They played honest, they didn’t foul, the referee didn’t have an impact in the match. But what is true is that we had lots of chances to score and they had just one chance. The opponent had one chance to score and we needed 12 chances to score one goal. We played against a team who defended with all their players in the goal and we had 12 or 15 chances. We allowed them to shoot just twice and that is something positive for us. But we cannot ignore that the lack of efficiency was the weak point for our team</p>
