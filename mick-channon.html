  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="matt-le-tissier.html">Matt Le Tissier</a>]</b> There is something even more important. Matt will have inspired a whole new generation of <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> players and <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> fans. Kids of 11 and 12 will have dreamt of being <a href="matt-le-tissier.html">Matt Le Tissier</a>, will in 20 years’ time be fathers taking their own sons to the games. The 32,000 people who came on Tuesday won’t forget him. How much of a failure is that?</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="matt-le-tissier.html">Matt Le Tissier</a>]</b> You need to have been a <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> supporter to really appreciate him. For no other player in the country could have done what he did for this club, not <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, not Keane</p>

  <p><b>[Referring to speculation over Hughes’ future, he said]</b> That’s a load of balls. You’ve gone with it now, get your head down and get on with it. You have to be a little patient in most things in life. We have to hold our nerve, we’re that far down the road. That would be my message to everyone at the club. Keep working hard and giving it your best shot and eventually things will come right.<br /><br />We’re struggling to score goals but we’re making chances and have defended well in the last couple of games so it’s not all doom and gloom. Even against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we had chances. If they didn’t you’d be even more worried but it’s just a matter of time before chances are taken.<br /><br />Barren runs go with the territory but Danny Ings has done well and Charlie <b>[Austin]</b> is getting his sharpness back after injuries. To stay in the Premiership you have to win games but if you’re making chances some will eventually be taken. You have to back them all and keep believing<br /><br /><b>[He is desperately hoping his beloved Saints can take something from the match, as they were so close to doing last November]</b> I hope I can get up there. It will be interesting, City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> look like the teams to beat this season so it’s not going to be easy. But you never know in these games. Often it’s when teams are underestimated that they put it all together and get a good result.</p>
