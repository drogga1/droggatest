<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mateo Kovacic was just 16 years, six months and 14 days old when he made his official first-team debut at Dinamo Zagreb]</b> It was the wish of his family, his parents decided for him. He was known in the football world but his family is very modest and never flew too high or wanted to skip some steps in Mateo’s development. They let things go the normal way, they wanted to return to Croatia, to go to Dinamo. They love their homeland and feel comfortable in Zagreb. They chose not to move for money or glamour. They recognised Mamic’s vision and they knew their son had the quality and would get his chance to show it..<br /><br />Dinamo could always recognise quality, a player worthy of getting a chance. Of course, he was not even close to being the player that he is today. Dinamo suffered losses because we believed in him and knew what he can bring us. Yes, there were times when it didn’t make much sense to play such a young lad at such an important position in some big game, but it was for a good cause. He is so polite, is not pushy and never made a big statement or gave pompous quotes. It was impressive for a kid who became famous at such young age<br /><br />I remember we were at a training camp in Medjugorje <b>[in Herzegovina]</b> when he signed for Inter. You can imagine what it means for any player to sign for Inter, but he was sad, he almost cried because he was leaving his club. He went around to say goodbye to everyone leaving the hotel. We were all sad, we knew we would miss him as a player but also that we lost a guy who makes you so comfortable on the pitch and outside the pitch. Even today when he comes to the club to say hi, you never notice he is part of the jet-set world of football<br /><br />In certain things he is not fully developed yet, like his position. At Dinamo he was an attacking midfielder, Inter played him behind the striker, as trequartista, while at Real he was a holding midfielder. It is high time he gets a defined position where he can give his best. It is good that he is versitile, but a player must have his primary position. In my opinion he is an ideal defensive midfielder. He can carry the ball to the opponents’ half, reach the strikers with his passing, he can keep the ball and he can help defensively because he reads the game very well. He became stronger so he can win duels. He’s top class. If he finds a club and coach that will direct him, he will dominate his position for years. Real resisted releasing him this summer, but that also proves his intelligence to pick the right path. He could have stayed in Madrid where he was European champion and an important player, but he wanted more. He wants to be part of the starting XI, to bring success to his club and to not just have a secondary role in the team. He wants to improve, to compete, be important, take responsibility. It was a good decision to move to Chelsea, it is the perfect team for him, a team that lacks his type of player and a coach that knows him from his time in Italy</p>
