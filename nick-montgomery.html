  <p><b>[Central Coast captain Nick Montgomery was delighted with his team’s performance at Allianz Stadium despite their winless run stretching to four games]</b> To come here and give them a game like that, I’m proud of the young players we’ve got. You can see we have come a long way in 12 months. Right at the end we were still going and I think that shows the character of this team. All credit to Sydney, they have been brilliant, but I’m really, really proud of the young boys tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Former Central Coast Mariners captain Nick Montgomery is relishing a new role with Wollongong Wolves]</b> No doubt, <b>[WIN Stadium is]</b> worthy for A-League standard. For me, playing in the A-League for five years, the one thing it needs is a few more teams and I wouldn’t have joined the Wolves if I didn’t feel it was an ambitious place and somewhere that I’d like to help out any way I can.<br /><br />I’ve had a good career up to now and, you know, I could have played on in the A-League or gone to Asia for another season but a new role at the Mariners came up - a head of football role - and I just thought it’s a good time to step down from the pro game on my own terms after having a good season<br /><br />I just needed to get in there and provide a bit of leadership and talking to the boys on the field, and I felt I did that well yesterday. The boys performed really well and worked hard for each other, and we got a 2-0 win, which was more than deserved</p>
