  <p><b>[Stewart Robson says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> should be looking to join <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the race for Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake]</b> I still think <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> is good player. There’s talk about him going back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they can buy him for a certain price but he’s a very good centre-half. He’s not the biggest but he’s got good spring and I think he’s the type of player <b>[Mikel]</b> <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will like. He would be my choice coming in from Bournemouth<br /><br /><b>[The Gabonese striker is yet to commit to a new contract]</b> I think at the moment <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> will stay and they need to keep him because he’s a great goalscorer and he’s saved <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> over the last couple of years. When they’ve not been playing well he’s got a goal. He teams up well with <b>[Alexandre]</b> <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> as well</p>

  <p><b>[Stewart Robson says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> was supposed to bring a touch of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> with him to Arsenal]</b> He needs to get some consistency in the way his team plays from one half to the next. There have been some games where <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have been totally outplayed. You think of <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in the first half where they couldn’t get near to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. You think of the second half against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at the Emirates where for 20 minutes <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were excellent. Then they went back into their shell, defended far too deeply and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> got back into the game<br /><br />The <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> of old closed the ball down, they stopped the opposition playing and getting out of their own half. This <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team are not doing that. They are not making it difficult for the opposition to get out of their own half. This is what <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has done at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and I thought that is what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> would bring to Arsenal<br /><br /><b>[Robson admits it is looking increasingly unlikely that a 10-point gap to the top four can be bridged]</b> They would have to put in an excellent run, they would have to put some consistency together. And that hasn’t been the case under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> and I wouldn’t say that has been the case under Arteta</p>

  <p><b>[Stewart Robson says Pepe is a flop at the moment, but can get better next year under Arteta]</b> Slightly too early <b>[to call him a flop]</b>. He hasn’t been a great success this season so far. He’s had one or two good games, a couple of good free kicks. I’m not sure they’ve found the right position for him. They’ve tried him on the right wing where he spent most of his time in France. Then they tried to play him up front for a couple of games. Yet he’s got pace, he can do lots of things. At the moment they haven’t got the best out of him, he doesn’t look a confident player. So he’s a flop at the moment but I think he can get better next year under <b>[Mikel]</b> Arteta</p>
