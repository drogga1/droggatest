  <p><b>[Isaac Success says Odion <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> always wanted <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> move]</b> I’m so pleased for him. He’s always wanted this and it’s finally happened. When he finishes his career he’ll be able to look back and say, ‘I did it. I finally made it to where I wanted to get to’. He messaged me straight away saying, ‘I’m back, I’m back’. He’s so happy there and ready to start working for the team to see what he can achieve there. He’s a very hard worker and waited so patiently for this opportunity. He’s getting what he deserves<br /><br />I know him very well. He played in Granada when I was there and he told me how good it would be to come to <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in a new environment and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We still talk all the time after he left <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and I can talk to him even more now he’s back in England. He is always encouraging me. He’s part of my family, like a big brother to me. I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to seeing him on Sunday</p>
