  <p><b>[Fabian Barthez says <a href="hugo-lloris.html">Hugo Lloris</a> was a better goal keeper than Brad Friedel]</b> <a href="hugo-lloris.html">Lloris</a> is one of the five best goalkeepers in the world. He is faster than <a href="brad-friedel.html">Brad Friedel</a>, he jumps higher and he is very strong mentally. What is happening now is incomprehensible, but I’m not concerned. He will become the centre-piece of the club. Hugo is a calm guy, a good worker. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will not let him stay on the bench for a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Another player to come up with a poor excuse for spitting was France’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who contrived to pick up a three-month ban in a friendly match while playing for Marseille against WAC Casablanca.
