  <p><b>[Sebastian Abreu talks about his Guiness World Record for most professional football teams played for by an individual]</b> Honestly, I was never trying to break a Guinness World Records title, but the record has made me very happy. The fact that a Uruguayan from the town of Minas can become the only player in the history of football to do this is something that makes me proud. I’ve really enjoyed all of the positive attention this record has brought. Perseverance is everything. Set goals for yourself. No one can take your dreams away, but you are the only one who can make them happen</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Abreu claims <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> was ready to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for Nacional]</b> I had full, real chances <b>[of being Nacional coach]</b>. And when in those days, after December 18, Luis was about to come, I said to him: ‘Look, Lucho, it is not anything concrete, but there may be a possibility … What’s your situation? What do we do?’ <b>[Abreu claims Suarez replied:]</b> ‘If you get to be <b>[coach]</b>, let me talk to Sofi (Sofia Balby, Suarez’s wife), talk about the family. I always told you that if you were a coach I could come back<br /><br />Going back to Nacional was something that motivated Luis, it was a nice challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Abreu, who also formed part of that Dorados team, later revealed that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was almost obsessive in his eagerness to learn from Lillo]</b> On the day Pep arrived, he watched our training session and ran off to the dressing room to look for a pen and pad. He called over, grabbed Juanma by the arm and sat down with him. This goes on every day – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday – and we start to get intrigued. If I learned one thing in my career, it’s that the stars are like sponges, so I go and ask, ‘Can I come too?’ Pep said ‘Sure, no problem’. So, I went, sat down and didn’t say anything. Pep would say, ‘OK Juanma, we did reduced spaces today, three against three with a man spare – why?’. He wanted to find out the objective of every training session, if it was to mould the team or to find out about the opponent. He knew it was never just training for the sake of it with Juanma. One day Juanma said to me, ‘Look closely at Pep; this guy has no limits. Remember that’<br /><br />For Pep to say that Juanma is the best speaks volumes about his work. Lillo is another (Marcelo) <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> case: they get called failures for not winning by those who look at the result and not the style of play</p>
