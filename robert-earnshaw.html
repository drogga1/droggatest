  <p><b>[Robert Earnshaw announces his playing retirement]</b> I’ve always been scared to see the end of my playing days and now that it’s here I’m sad. But I’m also excited that Vancouver Whitecaps FC have given me a chance to become the head coach of the U-14 Pre-Residency team.</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Earnshaw provides an interesting take on the future of technology]</b> Since we sent robots to Mars before sending humans,isn’t it possible that the first extraterrestrials that we encounter on earth could not be the aliens themselves, but might be their technology instead?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bale was a 16-year-old left-back when he was first called up in May 2006, having only played his first two matches of senior football for Southampton a month earlier]</b> At the beginning, he was very shy. When you’re a young man coming into an environment with lots of senior players, you’re trying to work out what to do, what your level is, and you could tell that was the case with him. But at the same time, you could see him being himself, what he wanted to be in his mind. He was quiet but, once he played, you could see him get more and more confident<br /><br /><b>[At 16 years and 315 days, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s substitute appearance against Trinidad and Tobago made him Wales’ youngest international, and he marked the occasion by assisting Earnshaw for the winning goal]</b> First of all I thought ‘Well done, kid’. I’d seen him a bit in training but you never know how a young player will react until you see them in a game. Instantly, when he picked up the ball and got his first assist for me, when he went on his dribble, you could see his ability. That’s when I thought ‘OK, he sees things, this is a good player’<br /><br /><b>[Now <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> was up and running, he started to relax]</b> He was joking, laughing - he’s always been one to have a laugh. At times you could see Gareth’s cheekiness. Then you could tell he was comfortable at that level. You see them grow as a person and a player. That’s a really special thing</p>
