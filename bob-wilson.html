  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Bob Wilson on <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>]</b> <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> is a mesomorph: the perfect physical specimen. With that pace, he could have been a top-class sprinter but when he runs, he’s doing it with a ball. You wonder how on earth he controls it, particularly with two players trying to mark him, but that’s what makes him a world-class striker. His eye for goal is getting greater and greater, he can improvise with his wonderful skills and his record <b>[for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goals]</b> will stand for a long time</p>

If <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> had played in the <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> team of 1974, Holland would have won the World Cup. The complete player: wonderful vision, can use either foot, so skilful and can score goals</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>]</b> A born leader. He learnt from his problems and has been an amazing role model since. You could argue that he’s the greatest <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player of all time because of his leadership qualities and he could play more than people give him credit for - especially after Arsene arrived and he started to play the ball out</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Bob Wilson would not be surprised to see Arsene Wenger leave the club at the end of his contract]</b> The big question now is, is this going to tip Arsene over the edge? He’s a hugely intelligent man; he can only take so much. He lives for the club, totally dedicated, very hurt when things go wrong. But as everybody knows and everybody sees now, his longevity in the job, 20 years, seems to be a little bit like a millstone round his neck when things go wrong. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Arsene, given the amount of headlines that are coming his way, might just look at that and say enough is enough. I think as a human being you can only take so much.<br /><br />Apart from the 20-minute spell when Arsenal came back to 1-1, when in fact Arsenal had two great chances, it was then a horror story, a total horror story. You have to point the finger at the players. When it comes down to a serious defeat, a really bad defeat, a capitulation almost, you have to look at the players. They are the ones that are letting themselves down, letting the manager down, letting the coaching staff down and most of all letting the fans down</p>

  <p><b>[On Boro Primorac]</b> No one should underestimate his importance to Arsenal. He is an integral part of it and he and Arsene are practically joined at the hip. He is an absolute walking encyclopaedia on world football. You could ask him about any player and he would give you his age, weight, his preferred kicking foot and a complete list of his habits. He and Arsene also share the belief that the three most important things in the game are technique, technique, and technique.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil is the most frustrating footballer ever connected with the club]</b> This is the most frustrating footballer ever connected with the club that I love, adore and would do anything for. He is the most naturally gifted footballer I’ve seen for a long time. He sees things that other players don’t see. He scored a goal against Bournemouth where, as he was one against one with the keeper, he bounced it into the floor. It was such an extraordinary skill. It’s almost like a trick shot to be able to do that when you’re on the run and one-on-one. He could have lifted it or bent it round but he actually bounced it and we’ve seen him do it before. His performance showed what Arsenal are missing in not playing him. But there is obviously a frustrating side to him in that you’re not quite sure which player is going to turn up on any one day because Mesut on his day is capable of wowing any audience and then he can be so frustrating knowing that there is so much there in the tank</p>

  <p><b>[former Gunners goalkeeper Bob Wilson says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will win trophies under ‘natural leader’ <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> As a former captain, first of all he is one of the most natural leaders I’ve seen. He’s hugely bright, he’s hugely eloquent. You only have to listen to his interviews. The bottom line is he cannot do it alone. He needs the players and he needs a good coaching staff, which I think he’s definitely getting together. The club - that is the board and Stan <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Kroenke</a> the owner - have got to give him the tools. That is now going to be even more difficult after Covid-19, but personally, I have a huge belief that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is the man and that we will be winning trophies under him<br /><br />Mikel has got three or four younger players coming through who have been blooded. The one who I think, if <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> let <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> go, it’s going to come back and bite us. He’s unbelievable with the positions he takes up. I’ve spoken to <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> technical director]</b> <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> about <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> and he says that he sniffs the chances. He’s got that unbelievable ability, probably god-given, to sniff out chances. This is a kid still<br /><br />They’ve got big decisions to make. There will be one or two who want to go, but they’ve just got to be sure that they keep the young ones who can be integrated in the same way as I remember in my time under Bertie Mee and <a href="don-howe.html">Don Howe</a>. Those kids come in and it can be like a jigsaw puzzle - straight pieces and funny-shaped pieces but they blend. Mikel, if he gets it right, can do that because I’m not sure how the transfer market is going to work in this financial situation</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Bob Wilson recalls battles with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> great]</b> My memories of Jimmy are mainly nightmares. Whenever I’m asked who I feared facing most in my career, it was Greavesy. That was even ahead of <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a> or <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>. Whenever I’m asked what made him so different and special it was his uncanny, radar-like understanding of the opponent’s goal. This isn’t a small place you’re guarding as a goalie, it’s a massive chasm - 192 square feet, eight foot high, eight yards wide. Whatever gap or whatever angle you think you actually fill, however much of the goal you cover, there is always inevitably a part of that 192 square feet that you simply can’t cover if the opposing striker has the skill and ability to find it. <a href="jimmy-greaves.html">Jimmy Greaves</a> was that ultimate, laser-like man. One look to assess, one touch to strike hard or bend the ball to that undefendable part of the goal. I may be exaggerating a little but, over our meetings, Jimmy seemed to score in what I would think was the impossible angle. After he’d done it, he would often give me a little grin. Fortunately he could never hear the expletives that I was uttering at the time. He was sensational, uncanny. The best of the best<br /><br />I’m often asked, if England would still have won the 1966 World Cup if <a href="jimmy-greaves.html">Jimmy Greaves</a> had played and not been injured. My honest opinion is they would not only have won it still but a damn sight easier than they eventually triumphed, with Sir Geoff’s hat-trick in the final<br /><br />It was one of those rarest things. Jimmy had an ability where he was running with the ball, he had hardly any backlift and the ball was on its way into the net. You’re almost trying to get set and … bang, it’s on its way. I hated playing against him. You can say that you have a love-hate relationship with someone and it’s not real hate, of course. It’s absolute respect for that individual. In my view, that is the ultimate wish for all of us who have been professional footballers<br /><br />Some footballers like me have to work their backsides off to eventually get there. To Jimmy, I think he was one of those God-given talents, whether you look through the Peles and the Maradonas and the greatest players that there’ve been in the history of the game. I promise you, it must be a 500 to 1,000 times, whenever I’ve done Q&amp;As and speeches - who was the most difficult, who was the one you dreaded facing most? Greavesy</p>
