  <p><b>[Soyuncu hoping to seal <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> switch after snubbing Turkish offers]</b> I hope I go to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I really want to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but everything depends on the team. I have a contract <b>[at Freiburg]</b> for three more years. I received bids from some of the teams in Turkey. I would not be able to give the team a name, but I did not accept it. I do not think about playing in Turkey at the moment. I want to continue my career in Europe, but of course, we do not know what will happen in the future. One day I wear the uniform of a Turkish club, but this is not necessarily the time. My current goal is to achieve greater achievements in a larger team</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester star Caglar Soyuncu credits coach <a href="kolo-toure.html">Kolo Toure</a> for his breakthrough season]</b> I would say the most important thing has been playing regularly. When you’re playing, you can only get better. The fact that the manager trusts in me - that gives me self-confidence.<br /><br /><b>[Soyuncu, 23, has worked closely with <a href="yaya-toure.html">Toure</a>, who is part of Rodgers’ coaching team, and says the Ivorian has been influential on and off the pitch]</b> He was very young when he came over to England as well. He’s shared his experience with me, the difficulties he had when he first arrived. It helps to listen<br /><br />Being in Germany before coming to England made it slightly easier to adapt but Kolo, my team-mates, lots of people at the club have helped me<br /><br />We all make mistakes… and he tells me when I make mistakes! But he also shows me where I have done well. He’s played for his national team, played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and had a great career. So I’m lucky that he plays the same position<br /><br />I’m always looking to learn from other people but I’m not trying to imitate anyone or become anyone. I’m trying to develop my own style. I trust my skill. I try to learn something from every game I play. It’s about minimising my mistakes</p>

  <p><b>[Caglar Soyuncu exclusive on Making <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> home and learning from Kolo Toure]</b> I would say the most important thing has been playing regularly. When you’re playing, you can just improve. The truth that the supervisor count on me – that provides me self-esteem. And we have a great deal of enjoyable at training. It’s a wonderful ambience.<br /><br /><b>[Soyuncu responds when informed he has in truth made a greater portion of onward passes than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s imperious <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> – 33 percent to Van Dijk’s 30 – yet he is a gamer bent on build his very own course, a guy ending up being ever before surer of his very own identification]</b> I’m constantly seeking to find out from other individuals yet I’m not attempting to copy anybody or end up being anybody. I’m attempting to create my very own design. I trust my abilities.<br /><br />I attempt to find out something from every video game I play. It’s regarding reducing my blunders<br /><br /><b>[He has actually played mainly together with Jonny Evans in a main protective pairing, in some cases in a 3, normally left wing yet periodically – as held true versus Southampton – on the right]</b> I do as I’m informed! It does not matter if I’m left wing or the right. The supervisor is great tactically. He and his personnel evaluate the resistance and we play as necessary.<br /><br /><b>[Evans is a continuous resource of motivation on the pitch]</b> he’s constantly attempting to aid the more youthful gamers <b>[…]</b> We all make blunders <b>[…]</b> and he informs me when I make blunders! But he likewise reveals me where I have actually succeeded. He’s bet his nationwide group, played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and had a wonderful job. So I’m fortunate that he plays the exact same setting<br /><br /><b>[The 23- year-old has actually leaned on <a href="yaya-toure.html">Toure</a>’s shoulder for assistance off the area]</b> He was really young when he came by to England also. He’s shared his experience with me, the troubles he had when he initially showed up. It aids to pay attention. Being in Germany before coming to England made it slightly easier to adapt but Kolo, my team-mates, lots of people at the club have helped me<br /><br /><b>[He stresses the worth of humbleness and effort]</b> We say in Turkey, it’s more important where you make your living than where you were born. You have to make that place your home. And I have made this place my home.<br /><br /><b>[The followers have actually assisted him to resolve]</b> From the first day I arrived I felt the warmth coming from the supporters. It’s not just me, they support the whole team. Winter, summer, home and away, they love their team. When you do well and see the supporters happy, it makes me feel proud<br /><br /><b>[But after a combined run of outcomes, Soyuncu’s eyes get on the Super Sunday encounter Burnley]</b> There’s a long way to go. We don’t talk about targets, we’re only concentrating on the next game</p>

  <p><b>[Soyuncu has suggested that he will shun any interest shown in him over the coming months]</b> I don’t think it would be right to go somewhere right now. I’m having a good season. Above all, I still have a lot to learn</p>

  <p><b>[Soyuncu set to frustrate <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and other suitors by sticking with Leicester]</b> I don’t think it would be right to go somewhere right now. I’m having a good season. Above all, I still have a lot to learn.<br /><br /><b>[Soyuncu said when asked about filling <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>’s boots]</b> He is the most expensive defender in the world and your team does not buy another because it trusts you. You play instead of someone who transferred for 80 million pounds<br /><br />We’re going well now, but the important thing is to keep it going. I played 30 matches, but it’s important to increase this to three-digit numbers. It is very important to be at the same level throughout your career<br /><br />After the games we played well, I was preparing myself as if I was preparing for my first game in the first training. I think this has had an effect. We still have the ambition to win. I think this is very important for young players</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk at the top of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> talent list]</b> I always watch and learn from other players. There are so many great defenders in this league. I wouldn’t limit myself to only watching one or two teams and their players, there are so many quality players in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I try to watch and learn from many others. There are so many good centre-backs playing in this league but I have to say Van Dijk is top of that list and where they <b>[are]</b> in the league and how he’s done shows that.<br /><br />I agree I’m having a very good season. It’s been great so far. Every time I play, I get better, I believe that. So to hear such good things from a player like Ilkay is very flattering. He’s a great player himself.</p>
