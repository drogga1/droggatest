  <p><b>[Romario explained how the date of his conversion from sporting tyro to public servant]</b> When I stopped being a football player, it’s true that politics didn’t even enter my head. Then eight years ago my daughter <b>[Ivy]</b> was born with Downs Syndrome. I started spending time with parents, relatives and friends of people who have some kind of disability. I began to realise there was no-one to represent these people in politics, so I decided to stand for election<br /><br /><b>[Romario says he is all in favour of leaving Brazil’s past behind]</b> But the people who took part in the dictatorship should be left behind too<br /><br /><b>[Romario conceded to us he wasn’t perfect. In one respect, though, he is determined not to sink to the level of some of his fellow MPs]</b> What I have in my conscience is that while I’m here in Congress, I won’t be corrupted, I will do justice to the people who voted for me</p>

  <p><b>[Romario gives advice <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> tips for World Cup successes]</b> Have enough sex is one piece of advice, as is making the most you can of your days off and, of course, concentrate on match days and during the games … I believe he’s quite aware of his football and what it represents for the Brazilian team. He has to arrive at the World Cup and score a goal. That’s the most important thing … The World Cup is a totally different competition from the rest, in which you have to be 100 per cent focused and push all your problems aside, otherwise you aren’t going to have the best Cup possible. It is good that he is playing in Europe because maybe 80 or 90 per cent of the best players in the world play there and he will have faced them already. But the first thing I advise him to do is have lots of good sex</p>

And if we didn’t even manage that, we had to rely on relatives … it was definitely a childhood full of hardships and poverty<br /><br /><b>[With both players clearly at ease with one another, Romário underlined the bond shared between the pair and indeed the rest of the squad when he said]</b> A lot of people have said the yellow jersey is a pretty jersey, but it didn’t have a heart beating inside. Following this World Cup, it might be possible to say it’s still a pretty jersey, but now with 11 hearts beating inside</p>
