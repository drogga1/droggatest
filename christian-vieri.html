  <p><b>[Christian Vieri on Intermilan]</b> I loved Inter. I would have killed for the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> shirt - every day. At training I was the first to arrive and the last to leave. My relationship with <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Moratti</a> was special, very strong. We spoke several times during the day, even at three in the morning. We talked about everything. So you understand the terrible disappointment when I found out that I was shadowed and even intercepted. Heck, these are things you do with the mafia!</p>

  <p><b>[q: How did it feel to score the 1,000th goal for Italy?]</b> I am happy to have scored the 1,000th goal in the national team (against Moldova in March 1997) but I never thought much about the records. It was a unique evening: my debut and my first goal. I do not follow the statistics but it was extraordinary to score such a historic goal on my debut<br /><br /><b>[q: You played in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and spent a season in Spain with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. What are the differences?]</b> I was happy to have done well in Spain by scoring 24 goals in 24 games, a record that I carry with me in my heart. I’m sad to have left Spain because in my opinion <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> is an exceptional, unique and extraordinary league.<br /><br />For me it is the most fun and technical. Twelve months in Spain were too few. When I played in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> it was a dream. In Italy there were Baggio, <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a>, <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Vialli</a> and many others, without forgetting <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> the Brazilian.<br /><br />I won the golden boot in both Italy and Spain. At Atletico you have to thank my partner Kiko and the whole team that supported me<br /><br /><b>[q: How does it feel to have the record of goals scored at the World Cup for Italy (9) together with <a href="roberto-baggio.html">Roberto Baggio</a> and Paolo Rossi?]</b> The World Cup is a unique event. When you see a blue shirt in a bar or in a pub, you immediately think of Italy. Scoring for your nation was a wonderful experience. I had three idols: <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>, <a href="roberto-baggio.html">Roberto Baggio</a> and <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Gianluca Vialli</a>. At 14 years old I went to see Baggio in the Fiesole Curve (the home of <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>’s Ultras), at 23 I had a World Cup next to Baggio. It was wonderful<br /><br /><b>[q: Can <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> be your heir at Inter?]</b> He is big, with plenty of strength and height as I had. He’s got a very strong left foot and gets lots of height when he jumps for headers. I wish him well and he has already scored 17 goals in his first few months in Italy: a truly extraordinary result especially for a foreigner used to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Vieri believes that <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> has everything to be a big success at his former club Inter Milan<br /><br /><b>[q: Can <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> get the best out of him?]</b> Antonio is a well-trained coach and knows how to looks after his players. The impression I get from <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is that he takes care of every detail, so I think he can really maximise <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s potential.<br /><br />In <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> if you have an exceptional physique and you train very well you can destroy any opposing defense. I have been following <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> for 10 years and have always supported his strength.

I would have played well with him as a partnership. I had the Brazilian <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Hernan Crespo</a>, <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Alessandro Del Piero</a>, <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>, Baggio.

But <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> is equally strong.<br /><br /><b>[q: Speaking of England, who were the most difficult English defenders you faced?]</b> In World Cup qualifying in 1997, I will never forget <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> and Sol Campbell: two very strong lions physically and mentally. Italy too had and has formidable defenders, but I have a great memory of those two. It was a pleasure to fight against them<br /><br /><b>[q: Is the Brazilian <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or the Portuguese <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> better?]</b> I am a friend of Ronnie and I was lucky enough to have him as a striker with me.

I jumped the goalkeeper and almost from the corner flag, on the goalline on the left, I scored. The other was for Inter against <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a> was in goal.
