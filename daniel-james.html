His advice was to be myself, which is what I will try to do<br /><br /><b>[The 21-year-old is in awe of learning from the best in the game and hopes to emulate Giggs’s success and longevity]</b> He wasn’t a bad player was he? What he did at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was amazing. Every young winger looks up to a person like him. He was playing in the Premier League until he was 40 and he was still beating players. Credit to him, the way he looks after his body. It is amazing for me, when I go away on internationals, to learn from people like him. He is obviously someone I aspire to be like<br /><br /><b>[James has impressed in his early days with United and caught the eye in Saturday’s 2-0 friendly victory over Perth Glory at the Optus Stadium]</b> Walking out there, with the amount of fans that have come from everywhere is surreal, really.

Being a winger, I’m always going to get fouled, but it’s just about how you get on with it. I don’t let it get in my head and just keep going. The Sissoko one, I’ve nipped in just before and he’s fouled me at the edge of the box in a good position.

  <p><b>[Daniel James has vowed that there is more to come from him after seeing a dream come true by netting on his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> debut against Chelsea]</b> Yeah, definitely. I didn’t start but that was not something I was gutted about. I just had to be ready to come on and I think everybody played a part in the win. To come on, I played on the right and on the left. I enjoy them both as much as each other. I knew the counterattacks were going to come, so it was just about being in the right place at the right time. Thankfully I was. I know the deflection was a bit lucky, but it paid off for me<br /><br />As I took the touch, some people would say it is a dummy. But the ball got away from me a bit, thankfully I think the defender would have blocked it without that, but as soon as I struck it the ball went into the back of the net and was pure emotion for me. I am delighted<br /><br />I was feeling excited. I wouldn’t say I was nervous. I was coming on when we were 3-0 up so it was just about going on there and enjoying myself, showing people why I am here. That is what it was. At 3-0 we were always going to have counter attacks and that suits my game a lot. To come on and to score, you couldn’t write it<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether a first taste of competitive action at the <a href="manchester-united.html">Theatre of Dreams</a> had lived up to expectations]</b> It lived up to my expectations, definitely.

Astana came to us and some people wrote them off before they played but they gave us a good game. I think you can never write these teams off. They wouldn’t be in the competition if they weren’t very good teams. Every game we play in Europe, we have got to be ready for it and prepare right. It was important to get off to a good start and it is another one where we have to go and win as it just takes the pressure off us, really. That comes with people expecting us to go through in the group, so to get two early wins would be great. As you see, when we score, we’re all together and, when we concede, we’re all together.

It’s different to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but it’s one we’re looking forward to and are going to be ready for.

It’s important to be versatile in all three positions because you never know when you need to be called upon. We might have an injured no.9 and I might need to go to play up there, so I need to be ready to play in all three roles. I do enjoy coming inside from the left. I can go down the line and cross with my left, or go inside but, for now, I think it’s just about sometimes scoring a few by coming inside means people are going to be wary of that.

  <p><b>[Daniel James says <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>’s return has been crucial to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s recent upturn in form]</b> Since he’s come back in, we’ve got that focal point. He’s a great link-up player. He can come short or go in behind. It’s been important for me and for Marcus since he’s come back into the team to get that interlink. Since he’s come back, he’s got goals and he’s got assists and he’s been great for us<br /><br /><b>[The Wales winger concedes he did not expect to feature so much but is relishing the opportunity]</b> Coming in was always going to be tough and it was going to be different from playing in the Championship. I think I’ve taken it in my stride, tried to calm myself down a bit and think, ‘I’m here for a reason’. At the start of the season, I maybe didn’t think I would play as much. Every game I’ve been learning and the gaffer has trusted me and I’ve really enjoyed it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> winger Daniel James has hailed <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> as a great player]</b> Yeah, Marcus is obviously a great player to play with. The abilities he has are fantastic and he’s getting better every game. Something we work on in training is the movement and things like that and obviously, for me, getting out wide and <b>[in]</b> those positions I want to find him as much as I can, to get him goals and for him to assist me as well.

That’s something we do in training all the time. Obviously it’s going to be different balls and you’re going to be in different areas but <b>[last Sunday]</b> for me, the right ball was to pull it back.

I played against them last season <b>[in the Championship and FA Cup]</b>. They’re a very good team and they’ve still got a lot of the players they had last season, but obviously they’ve added a lot of good players as well. They’ve come from a good win on Monday night and we’re preparing hard for it. They’ve got great qualities and that’s something we’re going to look at and we’ll try and get a stamp on it</p>

The ball came out to me and it’s not often you don’t see any defenders on the halfway line and my first instinct was just to run forward. I was at the goal before I knew it and I remember thinking: I can’t run the length of the pitch and not score!

I know there is a big rivalry and you could feel that. As soon as the game started it was just about concentration. We were 2-0 up by half-time and then it was just about going out there in the second half and sticking to that concentration. As a young boy you want to play for the biggest club and to play in a game like this, a Manchester derby, it’s something I’ve always dreamt of.

Now it’s about me continuing to do what I’ve been doing, I want to look at how I can add more goals and more assists to help the team. When the gaffer brought me in, he told me that I would play an important role here. Maybe I didn’t think I’d play as much as I’ve played now but that’s down to the gaffer and the staff pushing me and me working hard, and that’s something I’ll continue to do</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel James was quick to dismiss any talk that they consider themselves underdogs going into the match at Anfield]</b> I don’t think we go into any game feeling like underdogs. It’s always been like that and something I learned from day one here. We are United. It is going to be tough but we go into it feeling positive. We are the only team to have taken points off them already and we’ll go full of high hopes. It will be a case of doing what we did last time. We were unlucky to only get a draw with them scoring a late equaliser. We will go there with no fear<br /><br />Last time we played them <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b>, we were only a point off the bottom three and under pressure from everywhere. The players must have felt that, even though they handled the game fantastically. We are more confident, definitely. It is always the foundation of any team to defend well. We spent the majority of our money in the last transfer window on <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> and Maguire because we needed to defend better but also control and dominate.
