<blockquote>
  <p><b>[French coach Lionel Rouxel, however, seemed to opine that this match was more of a warm-up, with the group’s main opponents in the offing for Les Blues]</b> The game was of two parts. One where we scored six goals. The second half was more difficult. Players were tiring in these conditions. However, the real test match is Wednesday, when we face Japan. New Caledonia are a good team however, this is their first participation. My players were serious.<br /><br /><b>[Further questioned about his team’s opponents]</b> <b>[They were]</b> Different in level expected. Second half, we expected them to go down. Good to have New Caledonia in such a competition - a French territory.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed about France’s sole concession]</b> Fatigue. humidity. Lack of concentration. We need to rotate in such conditions to win WC. We need all 21 players<br /><br />France has good forwards. The academy is good at training them. Can’t compare these boys to senior players though. All players are important<br /><br />Yacine Adli played a good match. Great football player. Does things which other players cannot do. Need to preserve him. He can be a good player. The World Cup is a good thing for him. He needs three things to break into the Paris Saint Germain <b>[PSG]</b> side and become a top player - needs to be a good boy, a good mentality and good player<br /><br />The logic of France being better was expected. There is a vast difference Les Bleus and our side. So, no the result comes as no surprise to me. We will work out to come better in the next game. We have watched France many times and this was our first time on such a big stage. We knew what we were up against it. France are a high-level team and we will strive to reduce the gap in the future<br /><br /><b>[On the Penalty save]</b> The Goalkeeper showed his capabilities. We were jumping in elation and that too against France, it was surreal. It definitely means a lot to the people home given the ties with France.
Means a lot for the amateurs here, as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Meet Illan Meslier: The accidental goalkeeper wanted by Chelsea]</b> We didn’t hear from him for three weeks. Now he’s more open. He speak much more on the field and off it<br /><br />He’s no longer in a discovery stage of his career. He’s participated in high-level games. He still has details to improve on his positioning and his communication, but he’s doing well and I hope he’s going to be a good goalkeeper for the national team</p>
