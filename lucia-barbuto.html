  <p><b>[Inter and <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> target Agustin Urzi could be available for less than his €30 million (£26m/$32m) release clause, but Banfield are still waiting on a first formal offer]</b> There have been several inquiries, but we have not received any formal offers yet. When the interest is concrete, we will analyse it and evaluate what will be best for the future of the player and the club. With the current world situation due to the coronavirus pandemic, we don’t really know what the next transfer market will be like globally. The clause is €30 million. However, in order not to impact the player’s career, and taking into account the effects of the pandemic, we are willing to possibly negotiate even for a smaller figure. But, obviously, we will have to analyse the offer well from an economic and sporting standpoint<br /><br />He is one of the players trained in the club’s youth system. He established himself in the top league and has demonstrated his skills. Agustin is a player with big potential. I can’t say how far he will go, but I am convinced that he has all the characteristics to be a success. He is doing it in Banfield, and he has already achieved success with Argentina. I have no doubt that, in the future, he will make it, going where his talent and career will take him. He is a fast, unbalancing player with a change of pace and acceleration. He has great technique and speed. He is bold and brave</p>
