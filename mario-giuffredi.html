  <p><b>[The agent of Napoli defender, Mario Giuffredi, Elseid Hysaj has admitted to receiving contact from England for the Manchester United and Arsenal target]</b> There are several scouts who have come to view him, representing German and English interest, but we have no need to leave Napoli. Elseid is in his second season at Napoli and I think he can do well next term as well. The lad really wants to fight for the Scudetto, so both his intentions and those of Napoli coincide. Having said that, Hysaj has a release clause in his contract and if a club arrives that is intent on paying it, the player could leave. If that were to happen, we’d keep Napoli fully in the loop on everything and wouldn’t take any other paths without informing the club first.</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of in-demand Atalanta defender Andrea Conti, Mario Giuffredi, has told the likes of Chelsea to make a transfer approach now in order to avoid being left disappointed]</b> Napoli like Conti a lot. I’ve been talking about him with <b>[Napoli DS]</b> Giuntoli for over one year. I don’t think his price tag will lower in the next few months as he will be playing the U-21 European Championship too. Italian and Premier League clubs are interested in him and that’s good for Atalanta because the player’s price tag can only increase. If I were a president I’d try to sign him now.</p>

  <p><b>[The agent for Napoli defender Elseid Hysaj has defended his client from criticism by noting he could have joined Chelsea over the summer]</b> Those who criticise him probably never make mistakes, but the rest of us are mere mortals. Without that clause he probably would have gone to Chelsea this summer. People forget that he was one of the best two or three full-backs in Europe last season. Then it just takes two or three matches for him to become a donkey. I always say to let everyone talk and then respond on the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Elseid Hysaj’s agent, Mario Giuffredi, confirmed his client wishes to depart, but conceded it will require <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> lowering their demands, which currently stand at €40 million]</b> Hysaj has expressed his desire to leave, as he believes his time at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> has come to an end after four years and he wants a new experience. He will leave, there are teams that are interested, however, the club will have to lower their asking price. They have a shrewd sporting director in <a href="cristiano-giuntoli.html">Cristiano Giuntoli</a>, and he knows that Hysaj wants to leave, so they know they will have to find a solution to the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Giuffredi says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> made a huge offer to sign <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> right-back Elseid Hysaj in the 2018 summer transfer window]</b> Whatever happens with him, the outcome will be great. If we leave, we’ll do what we had to do in the summer. If we don’t leave, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> will lose the player on a free transfer, but it’ll always work out for us. A year and a half ago, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> could’ve taken €50 million from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. If Hysaj stays at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, the Neapolitan club risks losing the player for nothing<br /><br /><a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> is a club that Hysaj respects. Let’s see if there will be interest from Roma in the next few months, at the moment nothing is happening. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s assessment of his price was €25-30m, but as time passes it will go down. Some time ago we talked to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and were told his deal won’t be renewed. For three years Hysaj was the best right-back in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. He can go to the top with another club</p>
