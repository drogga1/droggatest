  <p><b>[Saints legend Francis Benali admits some may still hold a grudge against a man who left for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, but feels players of his quality should be sought. <a href="adam-lallana.html">Lallana</a> told he would be welcome back at Southampton as he struggles for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game time]</b> It’s a difficult situation for him to get back in the team. It’s a scenario that many players would find difficult. But what would be the tough thing is would the supporters welcome players <b>[like Lallana]</b> back to the club? It’s a relationship between the two clubs that has certainly spiked the nerves of Southampton fans with a lot of our top players leaving for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I just like to see good, talented and passionate players that want to play for Southampton - playing for my team. However that happens, I’m quite open to anything</p>

  <p><b>[Former Southampton defender Francis Benali explained about the challenge facing him as he attempts seven iron man races - a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile cycle and a marathon run - in seven days]</b> I remember how tough it was to play against <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a>, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a>, and you’d come off feeling it, but I don’t ever remember feeling exhausted during my football career. This is entirely different</p>
