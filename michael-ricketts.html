  <p><b>[Usian Bolt has been told to add some skill to his lightning speed to win a place in the Jamaica national]</b> Usain has a special attribute in his speed. If he can add a little bit of skill, some flair, he could supplement this Jamaican team. The players would certainly welcome someone like Usain. I have had informal discussions with some of them and they are excited at the prospect of playing with Usain. If he can make the transition from being a superstar on the track to being a good enough football player, then we will certainly call him up. We are presently in a competition, the Nations League. After the Nations League, we go into the Gold Cup. By then we will have had a chance to look at him and we’ll be in a position to make a decision.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed that Usain hasn’t signed up with a Jamaican club,” he added. “That would give us a chance to see a lot more of him. The coach will make a decision but we would love to see him in a serious, real match situation. We are hopeful because Usain would certainly be a crowd-puller. If he turns up in a Jamaican outfit then a lot of people would want to turn up and watch Usain Bolt play football</p>

  <p><b>[Jamaican international Tarania Clarke killed after reported dispute over mobile]</b> The Jamaica Football Federation is indeed deeply saddened by the untimely passing of young Ms Clarke, someone who would have shown so much promise, not just as a player but as a person. I must use this opportunity to personally and certainly on behalf of the JFF extend my most profound condolences to the immediate family members and friends of Ms Clarke, her school family at Excelsior and of course her club Waterhouse.<br /><br />The JFF must give as much support as we can during this time of bereavement to her mother and close friends. Indeed, we are truly saddened. I want to use this opportunity to implore our young persons to find different ways to solve our issues than just taking the lives of your loved ones</p>
