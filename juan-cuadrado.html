  <p><b>[New-look Juventus prove themselves Champions League contenders with Derby d’Italia win]</b> Why am I always happy? I was made like this. And the fact that I’m Colombian helps because South Americans are cheerful in nature - Colombians most of all. The Italians have a different culture; they are very concentrated. But Brazil have won five World Cups singing and dancing, right? It is not the case that if you listen to music, make jokes of if you smile, then you’re not thinking about the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Cuadrado’s energy was crucial to the clean sheet for Juventus and the winger backed up Bonucci’s claim that his team had shown off their quality at Camp Nou]</b> We came here knowing that we are a great team and we played like a great team. We were fully aware that Barcelona are also very strong, but we knew that we could defend well if all the players were sacrificing together, playing as a unit, and so we did. Who next? I think whatever God decides is best.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Cuadrado insists he is happy at Juventus]</b> Goodbye? I never thought about leaving Juventus, I’m happy here and I want to continue in this great club<br /><br />In the last two weeks I worked well and need to achieve a good level of fitness. We are reaching very good levels working with great determination. It’s going well, but we know there are things to improve, and we are committed to doing well. Allegri’s advice is useful, we want to be the team that we have always been, we need to give it our all. The difference is the desire to sacrifice, we have to always dream in greatness<br /><br />Dybala? He has everything to become better. Also, we’re working together on a celebration</p>

Then there will be the Copa America, it will be a great opportunity to win something with Colombia.<br /><br /><b>[Cuadrado, who gave up the No. 7 jersey over the summer to help accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> We all know that Ronaldo is a very special person, very kind and very professional, every day I learn something more about him, his hunger to win and to achieve his goals. It is a privilege to have him as a team-mate because he was and is a great player, who won everything thanks to the work he did</p>

He told me where he would use me, and I always give my best regardless of my position. Everyone knows my characteristics, him too. I’m willing to do what he asks of me, I will always do what’s best for my country<br /><br /><b>[Cuadrado is confident that all precautionary measures are being taken in Italy]</b> We are calm, because our team-mates <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Rugani</a> and <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a> are much better and we follow the indications of the government. I don’t want people to take this situation lightly. Here in Italy, it’s quite difficult. We must pay attention to what the authorities and our president say. It is four our sakes, people don’t believe it, but cases have increased with time, we must take the necessary measures to make sure that there are fewer cases in Colombia than there are here in Italy</p>
