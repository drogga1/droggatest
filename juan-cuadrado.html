  <p><b>[Juan Cuadrado claims to feel happy at Juventus and is planning on remaining with the Serie A champions for the foreseeable future]</b> I feel happy at Juve, my family is happy and our thoughts are to stay in Turin. It is a fantastic city that made us feel welcome<br /><br /><b>[International team-mate James Rodriguez is expected to be on the move before the next deadline passes]</b> For James, Italy would be fantastic, every team would be very happy to have a player like him. We all know the great player he is, it would be a very good move for him because it would allow him to grow tactically</p>

  <p><b>[Winger Juan Cuadrado has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract extension at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions have confirmed]</b> I am very happy and excited to continue my story with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I am very happy with what I have done, and I have truly learned a lot. I want to continue improving on the tactical aspect; I still have a lot of work to do on it and I hope to be a more complete defensive player. The league is surely still something special <b>[to win]</b>, and also the Champions League, which we have been going after for some time now. We hope that this is the right year, and obviously we work every day to get there</p>

  <p><b>[Cuadrado considered return to Colombia before penning new contract at Juventus]</b> I thought about going back to Independiente de Medellin. But maybe it will happen later. Since I talked to the <b>[Colombia]</b> coach <b>[Carlos Queiroz]</b>, I have always felt confident. He told me where he would use me, and I always give my best regardless of my position. Everyone knows my characteristics, him too. I’m willing to do what he asks of me, I will always do what’s best for my country<br /><br /><b>[Cuadrado is confident that all precautionary measures are being taken in Italy]</b> We are calm, because our team-mates <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Rugani</a> and <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a> are much better and we follow the indications of the government. I don’t want people to take this situation lightly. Here in Italy, it’s quite difficult. We must pay attention to what the authorities and our president say. It is four our sakes, people don’t believe it, but cases have increased with time, we must take the necessary measures to make sure that there are fewer cases in Colombia than there are here in Italy</p>

I only saw the photo without reading what had happened: I just looked and I thought I saw Rabiot. Sorry</p>
