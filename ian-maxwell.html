<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alex McLeish has left his role as Scotland head coach]</b> The decision to part company was not an easy one, especially given Alex’s status as a Scotland Hall of Fame member, earning 77 international caps, having played in three World Cups and taken charge of the national team for two spells. It was only taken after full consideration by the board and after an honest and respectful conversation between myself and Alex earlier in the week. Ultimately, the performances and results as a whole in the past year - and, in particular, the manner of the defeat in Kazakhstan - did not indicate the progress expected with a squad we believe to be capable of achieving more. With that in mind, it was agreed that we would seek to recruit a new management team to take us forward for the remainder of European qualifying campaign. At this point I would like to pay tribute to Alex for the good grace with which he has accepted the decision and for remaining unstinting in his support of the team for the remainder of the campaign. It befits his status as a Scotland legend and Hall of Fame inductee. We firmly believe we have the potential to recover from the opening group defeat and unlock the potential of this exciting squad of players for the remainder of the campaign, safe in the knowledge we also have the play-offs as an additional route to Euro 2020</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Clarke has officially been named as Scotland’s new permanent manager]</b> I am delighted that we now have the country’s deserved Manager of the Year to lead the Scotland national team and his experience over the past two decades will be integral to rejuvenating our UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, which resumes next month. It was important that we undertook the recruitment process diligently and respectfully, especially given the importance of the final games of the domestic season for Kilmarnock, Steve and his players</p>

  <p><b>[A World Cup 2030 bid from the United Kingdom and Ireland is looking increasingly likely after ‘positive’ talks about its feasibility]</b> The feasibility study’s come back. ybody’s been round the table talking about it. So we’ll just progress things from there and see where we end up. The decision is now 2024 so we’ve got a bit of time. The signs are positive but it’s football, a lot can happen and because the decision’s now delayed for a few years it gives us a bit of time to take stock, reflect and see what we’re going to do going forward<br /><br /><b>[When asked if the football associations will now be seeking financial backing from their governments]</b> The next step is just to keep working within the home associations and take things from there. Football supporters want to go and watch Worlds Cups. If we can get major tournaments, major finals, back to Scotland then that’s great for the Scottish football public</p>
