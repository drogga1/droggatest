I think what we want to do is to sit down with them with a blank piece of paper and come up with a proper solution that satisfies everybody. I don’t think it has ever been done before. Most of the world’s top agents are in one room together and 100% of them agree on a course of action and it is lovely.<br /><br />We want fairness. We do a very good job and we act for players. We don’t act for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> should recognise us and treat us in a proper manner.

They have never had a conversation with me.<br /><br />It is something I think that they think can get them votes and get the public on their side. I think it is rubbish. If you ask players what they want, they are in favour of agents and there are never complaints about agents’ fees from players.<br /><br />It is just ludicrous what <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> are saying. No, no <b>[they are yet to talk to us]</b>. That will hopefully come. We will still write letters to them and hopefully be talking to them and we are waiting for their reply.

  <p><b>[Jonathan Barnett says Player wages should not fall after coronavirus pandemic]</b> I don’t see players’ wages dropping, that is for sure. Most players are on contracts.

Market values will come back.<br /><br /><b>[On the approach clubs should take]</b> You have just got to look at it sensibly and say, ‘This year I can’t afford to pay so I won’t do it this year’. Act sensibly and pay what they can afford to pay. If they can’t <b>[afford to buy]</b>, they don’t. Nobody is going to be forcing them. They can offer for a player whatever money they can afford. If it is right for the player, it’s fine. If not, then he stays where he is or goes somewhere else. After the next television deal they <b>[clubs]</b> will hopefully be in a better position, or once the fans start coming back they might be in a better position again to do it.

  <p><b>[Jonathan Barnett has slammed the joke speculation which continues to surround his Gareth Bale]</b> Nothing bad has ever come out of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> about <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has never said anything bad about <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> - but the press keep on making things up. So-called ‘experts’ come on television time and time again and say things like ‘the biggest problem with <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is that he doesn’t speak Spanish, and it’s a disgrace’. Those people have never met him, and never asked anybody, so I have no idea where they get this opinion. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> speaks Spanish, so I don’t want to hear these so-called ‘experts’ who make complete idiots of themselves when they come on TV to speak rubbish. And I also blame the TV companies for bringing these so-called ‘experts’ on; how can these ‘experts’ on <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> speak about <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> when they’ve, A) never met him, and B) wouldn’t even recognise him half the time. It’s a joke!<br /><br />It’s always been good. I’ve had the most fantastic relationship with the president, the chief executive and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. We’ve obviously said words with each other, but everybody has an argument or so. But it’s never been personal and it’s never been bad, and we are all on good speaking terms</p>

  <p><b>[They will not be the only ones in the mix, though, if a scramble is sparked for a prized signature, with Saul’s agent Jonathan Barnett admitting as much]</b> Somebody like <a href="saul-niguez.html">Saul Niguez</a> doesn’t need anybody to push him. He’s so good and everybody knows that and they know a lot of clubs want him. But he’s already at a very big club. He has a very good relationship with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> and Atletico fans<br /><br />Every good player is linked with another club. Some agents may want to do that and if they need the press to do something, then they are not very good at their job. It’s journalists trying to write things. It may be true or may not be true, but it’s something we as an agency at Stellar don’t really get involved in</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd move no priority for <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> at present as agent addresses <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> exit talk]</b> Jack is captain of <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, his first priority at the moment is to make sure they stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Until that’s sorted out, we don’t have the discussion. He’s got his priorities right, he has a job and that’s what he’s going to do. He’s going to fight for Aston Villa</p>
