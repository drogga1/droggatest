  <p><b>[Gareth Bale’s decision to play for Wales instead of England has cost him millions of pounds]</b> When we first got together when he was 15, we talked about whether he was going to play for England or Wales. I nearly got my head bitten off by his dad, who is fanatically Welsh, and his mum. He could have qualified to play for england through his grandmother and I tell you that it has cost him millions and millions of pounds. You can imagine what it would have been like if he were playing for England next summer in the Euros, but he does love playing for Wales.<br /><br />Now, he is not playing wide right, he is playing more centrally and that is going to suit him more and give him the sort of freedom he has with Wales. He enjoys that role because he was getting a little frustrated. Last season he didn’t get the ball that much and when he did get it was slow. By the time he received it, there were already three men on him. He doesn’t get appreciated at Madrid because the fans love Ronaldo. If you watch the way Real Madrid play this season, I think you will see a shift. I think things are maybe changing</p>

Gareth does not need <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo to leave Real Madrid, he is already a top star of the club. Bale is such a positive example for children. You will never see him in a fast food restaurant. He goes to bed early and I don’t think he is worse than Neymar. He can also battle it out for the Ballon d’Or in the future.<br /><br />I think no Serie A club can afford to buy Bale. There was the interest of a top Italian club <b>[in the past]</b> but I can’t name it. Tottenham, however, refused to sell him<br /><br />I think I am the best agent in the world. My agency Stellar has more than 100 players, it’s the biggest one out there. I really respect <b>[Mino]</b> Raiola and Jorge Mendes, we are like the Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar of agents</p>

It’s true that since CR7 arrived the foreign superstars are starting to consider Serie A and start looking at it in a different way compared to the last years.<br /><br /><b>[On Wojciech Szczesny]</b> He’s the Juventus No.1, he’ll 100 per cent remain in Bianconero.

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale’s agent has said the Welshman has no plans to leave Real Madrid]</b> He wants to play all his career for Real Madrid and if it does not work out, we will talk again. He will talk with Mr <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane, take it from there and then see at the end of the season<br /><br />Gareth wanted to play one way and Zidane wanted to play another. That was the cause of it and over a period of time it got worse. If you let Gareth play the way he wants to play, having a run of games in a row not in and out, he can be right up there with Cristiano Ronaldo. He still has a great talent. Gareth is very strong. He is a very strong-willed person and does not care what the press say. The jeering <b>[from fans]</b> is not something that bothers him, he does not understand what he has to do. Look at his record, what he has won and how he has played. In years to come, these people who are booing him, their children will be looking at the goals he scored and will be saying, ‘what a wonderful player’<br /><br />Bale is a very quiet man. He has been accused of some terrible crimes like not wanting to stay out until 1am. That is terrible and every paper said that was disgusting. Can you imagine the reaction of the papers here if they saw an English player out at 1am? He loves to be fit, he has a regime and he sticks to it. He is the perfect pro. He is very friendly with everyone, they know what he does and playing golf on a day off is not a crime. If anybody from the club wants to play he is available. He is fine, loves life in Madrid and has always been happy. It is very unfair of the press. I assure you Gareth does not read the papers about himself. The press are wrong to behave like that, it incites the fans. I also have a big gripe with the British press in that he is one of, if not the best, export that has ever left Britain to play abroad, one of the best players Britain has ever produced and unbelievably, even the newspapers in England don’t stop knocking him. Ronaldo would never get knocked in Portugal, Lionel Messi wouldn’t in Argentina, Neymar would not get knocked in Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Barnett says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is not interested in a return to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I have no idea what his value is. His salary is quite high and also where he wants to go is very important in his life. I can’t put a figure on it. It’s for the clubs to decide what they want to pay for him. As I’ve always said, he’s quite happy at Madrid. He has a very nice lifestyle, I don’t see why he wouldn’t see his career out in Madrid probably. It’s his life that he wants to lead. Financially he will want enough for the rest of his life and all his children and grandchildren. He’s won nearly everything in the world except the World Cup. To come back and play <b>[in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> would be a big thing but I don’t think he wants to do that at the moment as he’s quite happy to play at Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Barnett says Player wages should not fall after coronavirus pandemic]</b> I don’t see players’ wages dropping, that is for sure. Most players are on contracts. What I do see is maybe clubs have to look at how they run their club a bit better. Fans come to see players play, no one comes to see the chief executive play, that <b>[players]</b> is what puts money on the table. It’s not a question of players earning less because it is a short period of time to earn their money<br /><br /><b>[Barnett was asked if the days of huge transfer fees are over]</b> I think in the short term <b>[there will be a drop]</b>, but not in the long term. They <b>[the huge transfers]</b> will come back. Market values will come back.<br /><br /><b>[On the approach clubs should take]</b> You have just got to look at it sensibly and say, ‘This year I can’t afford to pay so I won’t do it this year’. Act sensibly and pay what they can afford to pay. If they can’t <b>[afford to buy]</b>, they don’t. Nobody is going to be forcing them. They can offer for a player whatever money they can afford. If it is right for the player, it’s fine. If not, then he stays where he is or goes somewhere else. After the next television deal they <b>[clubs]</b> will hopefully be in a better position, or once the fans start coming back they might be in a better position again to do it. Then their sponsorships go up and all these things come back.</p>
