  <p><b>[Stefano Tacconi on greatest italian]</b> Is Gigi the best in Italian history? No, but he is the best of his generation. For the greatest, there’s Zoff. And even during my era there was Zenga, and then <a href="angelo-peruzzi.html">Peruzzi</a>. But <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> is a great goalkeeper. He has done great things and he’s the best of his generation. And he could still be like Zoff - he could play in the World Cup in 40. He is still in shape and playing well. I certainly hope he makes it to Russia</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> goalkeeper Stefano Tacconi on Roma goalkeeper <a href="wojciech-szczesny.html">Wojciech Szczesny</a>’s erratic displays]</b> He’s a good goalkeeper, there’s no doubt about that. But he’s an uncontrollable lunatic - he’s completely mad. And for this reason he’s a risk</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> goalkeeper Stefano Tacconi believes ‘the coronavirus is just the flu’ as he declared football should be allowed to resume with crowds]</b> For me, the coronavirus is just the flu. When they tell me in a conference that there have been thousands of deaths, tell me which ones were of coronavirus. You can’t tar them all with the same brush. I’d want to resume playing, even in front of fans<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his former club, Tacconi noted that Adrien Rabiot is far from necessary following recent claims he was on ‘strike’ , while also declaring <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a>’s autobiography included ‘the usual rubbish’]</b> Rabiot’s a lucky boy. If he wants to leave, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> wouldn’t struggle without him. I would’ve agreed to a pay cut. As for <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>, it’s the usual rubbish. I said so many things too</p>

  <p><b>[The Supercoppa with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> provided the perfect opportunity for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> to showcase their new direction, yet a 5-1 defeat only exposed their amateur application of the offside trap]</b> We had problems with Luigi Maifredi from the start, from when we arrived for pre-season and he didn’t want to give me the captain’s armband. I had to call L’Avvocato <b>[Gianni]</b> <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> to get it. Before the Supercoppa against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, some of my teammates asked me to persuade him not to play zonally because no-one had understood his style of play yet. He decided we should mark <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> zonally and we conceded five!<br /><br />There’s a huge gulf between them. Trap’s someone who has played football and knows everything about players. The other coach, his name I won’t even mention because he brings bad luck, arrived as the new prophet of football who won while having fun, and instead he was a disaster. Like many coaches who have never kicked a football, they struggle to understand it and I’d go even further than that: they don’t understand anything</p>
