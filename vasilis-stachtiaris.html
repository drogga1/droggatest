<blockquote>
  <p>[How Arsenal beat Olympiakos &amp; Udinese to the signing of Konstantinos Mavropanos] I grew up in the same neighbourhood with his father, so I’ve technically known Dinos since he was two years old. He was at Apollon Symrni for eight-and-a-half years and, when they dropped to the second division, he managed to play in the last two games for the Under-20 side - despite still being a member of the under-17 squad. He signed for PAS Giannina in 2016 after I recommended him to Giorgos Christovasilis [PAS owner] and, coincidentally, they come from the same village [Agnanta, Epirus]. In pre-season [summer 2015], he played with PAS Gianninia and he scored in a friendly game but he wasn’t registered to the club, so Apollon threatened to appeal claiming that it was illegal for him to join PAS. He returned to Apollon and stayed there until January. Their former coach Alekos Vosniadis recognised his talent but didn’t offer a professional contract to him. FIFA rules state that if a player is 18 years old and he is not considered a professional, then he can leave. We made a complaint to the Greek Football Federation [EPO] and, after two days, Mavropanos was a free agent and allowed to join PAS [in January 2016].<br /><br />Mavropanos had an agreement with Olympiakos before the Arsenal offer came in. But there were also advanced talks with Udinese. Two other teams from Spain, Eibar and Rayo Vallecano, were interested as well. We had talks with AEK Athens but the offer was low. So, Olympiakos were in pole position but he wanted mainly to play in a league abroad. It’s not in his favour that he played just 17 games with PAS Giannina in Greek Super League but he is an asset for Arsenal and the club must protect him and invest in his talent<br /><br />Mavropanos’ story so far is similar to [Bayer Leverkusen midfielder] Retsos. They both played about 15 games in Greece and then moved to major leagues. But, if you ask me which player [Mavropanos] reminds me of, I would answer Traianos Dellas. He has the style of Dellas 14 years after the unforgettable matches of Dellas during Euro 2004 in Portugal. I must say he can use his left foot better than Dellas. Greek football is not at the highest level of European football but this guy has the right elements [to succeed]. He is very strong, has agility, he is not lacking of technique. He’s great in the air, good with the ball at his feet and uses his height to his advantage. He can play with both feet, is very strong and works really hard<br /><br />He’s intelligent on the pitch as well as off it. Nothing is concrete in football. His future depends on how he improves while at the club but I’m sure he will progress well. Mavropanos is a hard-working player and has his feet on the ground. He listens to what the coach says to him. You cannot predict [whether he will go on to play in the Premier League] but he’s already reached a significant level in his career by moving to Arsenal and he has the potential to develop as a player</p>
