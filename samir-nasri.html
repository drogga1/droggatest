  <p><b>[Samir Nasri on himself]</b> I did not show a professional attitude at EURO 2012. But I didn’t kill anybody. Worse things happened in 2010. I have been given a second chance. I had not been called up for a year and feared I might not get a second chance. It hurt a lot watching all of France’s matches</p>

If he wasn’t African everyone will say he’s the best midfielder in the world. He can do everything, he can score goals, he can defend, he can attack. When he gets the ball he is so powerful. Of course it counts against him being from Ivory Coast. If he was Argentinian or Brazilian everyone would be talking about him. Tell me one defensive midfielder who can go forward like him who can score 16 or 17 goals in a season. Tell me one and then we can talk</p>

Sometimes it is better to buckle but it is something I can’t do. I managed when I was younger and sometimes I went home with a knot in my stomach. Afterwards, you go off, but not with the right person. I’d therefore prefer to say everything I think, even if it means I’m not liked, even if it means I sound arrogant. At least the folk I do like don’t have to suffer</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla midfielder Samir Nasri has branded <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> a cheater. Nasri has accused the England striker of making the most of the confrontation and believes he conned referee Daniele Orsato into sending him off]</b> For me he’s a cheat because if he was a foreign player you, the English press, would be saying he’s a cheat. For me he is a cheat<br /><br />They were winning 2-0, play the game like a man. You are not better than us but you are winning 2-0 and will qualify, just play the game. For an international player you don’t need to do that. Look at the image. Yes he did it, but he did it well.<br /><br />He played it well. I thought the English players were tougher than that. He is the one who came to my face.<br /><br />I’m surprised but I should have thought about it and not reacted but I’m a man. I see the whole thing, coming out of the Champions League which is a big blow for us. It was just a reaction. It was a foul or something and then he pushed me and I said ‘what are you doing?’ and then he came to my face. That’s what happened<br /><br /><b>[And the France international, who needed to be escorted off the pitch by team-mates, wanted to confront <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> after the game]</b> If I tell the truth I don’t think you will be able to write it. I would love to speak to him (but there are) too many cameras and security and I have to think about next year and not getting a big suspension</p>

Belgian side Anderlecht have confirmed the signing of former Arsenal, Manchester City and France midfielder Samir Nasri, reuniting him with his former City team-mate Vincent Kompany. The 32-year-old hasn’t played since leaving West Ham at the end of last season, six months after signing a short-term deal with the Hammers in January</p>

Why? Because he is Algerian and I also like his style of play. <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a> is a collective player, while Salah is much more an individual player. He only aspires to score goals. I wouldn’t say Salah is selfish, but he runs after goals and statistics. <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a>, meanwhile, you can play one-two with him. He is a player with whom you can easily develop</p>

He is the one who sends me the sessions I have to do, I also speak with Vincent Kompany</p>
