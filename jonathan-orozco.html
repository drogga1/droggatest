  <p><b>[On Santos Laguna]</b> It’s a group of great human beings. They’re great players, but they’re better people. It’s the most beautiful thing we have. There’s a mystique we were able to recapture, and we deserved it, honestly. We had a great season and a great playoff run</p>

  <p><b>[Santos goalkeeper Jonathan Orozco could be difference between his team or his former team advancing]</b> You do your job. I always give my maximum effort for my teammates, for the team, for the club we represent, but apart from that it was a match worthy of the Liguilla. We had clear scoring chances that we couldn’t convert.<br /><br />We’ve got a great team that can turn things around on our field, with our fans. We know it’s going to be complicated. Monterrey has a great squad, they showed that in their house, but even so I think that we can come back from 1-0 down. We’ve got this confidence in ourselves. For us, right now the most important thing is to turn the page. We’ve got 90 more minutes on our home turf and we want to do the best possible to keep advancing</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico 3-0 cruise past USA on Friday]</b> If that’s the B national team and we won 3-0 against the United States, I think that’s a good national team. For me, there’s no A or B. I represent my country. That’s the most important thing for me. When I put on the badge, the most important thing is just to represent my country well. You can call it what you want to call it, but for me it’s about working hard, doing things well and taking care of what we need to do</p>
