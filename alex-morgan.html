Going into a competitive environment like that where I need to show my best self every single day is going to definitely challenge me and make me prove my best every single day.

We have incredible depth and the front three that started today and the front three that came off the bench are all competing for three spots. This team has always been known for its depth but I do think this is the best team that I’ve played with on the national team.<br /><br />We have been talking about how excited we are to get out of here, no offense to anyone. We are ready to have that tight-knit community within our team, and continue to build that chemistry. Also, no offense to this, just get away from the media for a little bit, and just disconnect with everything and connect more with the team. We’re really looking forward to that piece of it, and enjoying each other’s company before the roller oaster gets real.</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup can be a tipping point for the women’s game]</b> Playing there two years ago you saw that it was growing but there was still sort of that untapped potential as well, and I think that things were being held back a little bit culturally. I think that this tournament can change a lot of people’s minds.<br /><br />In France having a competitive league will help. I think for now there are only two or three teams that can really compete at the top. Obviously Lyon is just incredibly dominant and just the best club team in the world, so it’s kind of getting the rest of those teams up to speed. For all of us it’s just continuing to create a stable and growing league in our own countries. In the U.S. we’re seeing that as well. We want to make sure that it continues to grow at a pace that’s not too accelerated but is not stagnant</p>
