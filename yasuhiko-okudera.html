<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Okudera earned his move to Cologne after making a name with Furukawa Electric in the corporate Japan Soccer League]</b> I really wasn’t sure if I’d be able to make the grade over there. The first season was a real struggle, not so much in terms of the style of play, but it took a while to get used to the lifestyle. It was from my second season onwards that I felt I had a good grip on things<br /><br /><b>[After three seasons at Cologne]</b> I was thrilled to be offered a contract at Bremen. I wanted to play in midfield, but <a href="otto-rehhagel.html">Rehhagel</a> told me I was going to be a right-back. And he told me we’d be playing a zonal defence: I’d never imagined I’d have to learn that because almost everyone else was using man-to-man marking<br /><br /><b>[Having become increasingly settled after his five years in Germany, Okudera thrived in Werder’s colours]</b> I was at my most consistent while I was playing at Bremen. I didn’t have any problems with the language or my environment or anything<br /><br /><b>[Okudera is still closely involved with football in Japan, in his role as president and general manager of J.League second-flight team Yokohama FC]</b> We need more Japanese who have played overseas to return and share their skills and knowledge here. Urawa Reds and Gamba Osaka have played at the previous two <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cups, but it’s difficult for Japanese players to get regular games against overseas teams. I’m sure that if Japan was in Europe, we’d be a stronger football nation than we are now. Japanese teams must be careful they don’t get left behind by European clubs. Players like Makoto Hasebe are playing in Germany but Japanese club officials, as well as players, have a lot they can learn from overseas. I want more Japanese people to know about football, and I want to help take Japanese football to the world</p>
