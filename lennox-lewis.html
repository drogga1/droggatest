  <p><b>[Lennox Lewis, the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, was among those who pointed out in the aftermath how tough it is for a British fighter to be given a decision on American soil]</b> This Wilder-Fury judging takes me back to my first fight with Evander Holyfield. Just goes to show how hard it is for a Brit to come to America and take someone’s belt even though that’s what we clearly saw. Big up to Tyson Fury who never ceases to amaze me. Hold your head high!</p>

  <p><b>[The judges’ scoring drew criticism from a number of figures within boxing, with former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis arguing that Tyson Fury won the bout]</b> They need to get some good judges, these judges were terrible. It happened to me and I knew it was going to happen to him. Everybody could see who won. Boxing definitely won and Tyson Fury won the fight to me. But that’s why you’ve got to go in and try and knock the other person out, especially if you’re not on home soil. You’ve got to make your fists be the judges</p>
