<blockquote>
  <p><b>[UEFA endured a good deal of criticism when launching the Nations League]</b> The feedback has been very positive. This competition has impressed many people. One of the objectives was to turn the interest-free friendlies into very interesting matches. I don’t want to appear as immodest, but I think it’s been achieved because the matches were even more meaningful than people expected.<br /><br />You see what happened in some of these rounds and I’m not just talking about the matches of League A. Incredible clashes, incredible comebacks, the interest was alive to the very end of the very last match<br /><br />It is definitely an extra, super-important motivation. Of course, this was extremely important for all the teams, but even beyond that everyone feels that they have something to compete for. By winning the league you get promotion and you get some more money, which means we have found all the possible incentives for the teams. I think the fans have understood it too<br /><br />Every time we change, it’s difficult to get an understanding. But it’s not difficult to understand. The system that we have taken for this international competition is nothing worse or nothing less than a normal league system as applied to clubs, everywhere in every country<br /><br />Of course, everyone has a point of view and the point of view of a club manager is not necessarily the same as a coach of a national team. This is a very meaningful competition for sure<br /><br />You always have to learn lessons. There is nothing which is perfect and everything is open to improvement. We will definitely be debriefing about the Nations League, thinking about the future. We will never stand still. Whenever there is something to improve, to make the competition better, we will go for it. We will be brainstorming about the Nations League. We will try to identify if there is anything we can do to make it even better<br /><br />The Nations League has been accommodated comfortably in the dates of the international match calendar. We don’t anticipate any possible change. Of course, the calendar can also be optimised but the space for national teams will be there. And we are just planning ahead for the future to have the Nations League which is established now. And definitely one of the must-haves in the international landscape<br /><br /><b>[When asked to give the inaugural competition a score out of 10]</b> Can I say 10?! It’s not me saying that. I have read many, many pieces about the Nations League. The media are usually very demanding and I’ve seen widespread praise for the Nations League from different countries, coming from many sources, different journalists. If this is what the opinion leaders think, the media thinks and the fans think, then it’s very good. At UEFA, we are very happy that the Nations League has been introduced and we are very happy that all matches count for national teams. It’s a good asset to look after</p>
