  <p><b>[Will the Nations League save international football?]</b> UEFA had been developing the Euro final tournament but not been focusing or doing anything for the matches which involve all national teams. The Euro is just for those few who qualify but the bread and butter for the national teams is qualification matches. Nothing had been done since the middle of the 2000s so we thought that we needed to dedicate to national teams the same attention that had been dedicated to the clubs. To build something, to bring about a competition with identity and with branding which could break through even more with the fans.<br /><br />The Nations League has a set of regulations which is absolutely similar, except the formal part, to the regulations of the qualifiers. These are competitive matches which are regulated by rules which are practically the same<br /><br />National teams and clubs are the two souls of football. The two are equally important. You can’t have national teams without the clubs and vice versa. And the fans hugely enjoy both. There was huge potential for the competitions for national teams to be improved and we have been trying to bring to the surface what could be done. And in doing this, especially regarding the European qualifiers, we have used some of the recipes which have been tested in other competitions and which work very well<br /><br />Today, what is possible was not possible before. An English fan who was also interested in watching France, Spain, Italy, Germany etc in the past had a problem because all these teams played at the same time as each other. Today if England play on Thursday, most probably Spain play on Friday and all the other teams. We think that this is a good service to the fans, the football lovers who like their team and who also like to see the matches played by other teams<br /><br />We have to make the best possible use of the calendar so that the fans know exactly who’s playing when and they have the possibility to get access to as many matches as possible. Which is what we are doing currently with the concept of the week of football where between Thursday and Tuesday all matches are spread and the television broadcasters are able to buy the rights<br /><br />The next qualification process as far as UEFA is concerned, the seeding of the teams will be based on the ranking of the Nations League and no longer on the coefficient<br /><br />First of all the national teams can only play in the international windows. From experience I can tell you that the international calendar is a very sensitive and delicate matter. It is a very high point of balance which is to be struck between clubs, their leagues and the national teams.<br /><br />Obviously everything can be reviewed, improved, certainly I know that this calendar was a balance not easy to be struck. If in the future there will be a review, we will see. For the time being obviously this is not possible because we are not the masters of the calendar.<br /><br />The calendar is a worldwide one. UEFA cannot unilaterally decide to play national teams matches on different days or in clusters in June or another period of the year. If there is a new calendar, this calendar will have to be negotiated by the main stakeholders around the world.<br /><br />The calendar is the FIFA international calendar. Obviously, everyone has a stake, the confederations of course, the national associations, the competitions, the domestic leagues and the clubs</p>

  <p><b>[UEFA endured a good deal of criticism when launching the Nations League]</b> The feedback has been very positive. This competition has impressed many people. One of the objectives was to turn the interest-free friendlies into very interesting matches. I don’t want to appear as immodest, but I think it’s been achieved because the matches were even more meaningful than people expected.<br /><br />You see what happened in some of these rounds and I’m not just talking about the matches of League A. Incredible clashes, incredible comebacks, the interest was alive to the very end of the very last match<br /><br />It is definitely an extra, super-important motivation. Of course, this was extremely important for all the teams, but even beyond that everyone feels that they have something to compete for. By winning the league you get promotion and you get some more money, which means we have found all the possible incentives for the teams. I think the fans have understood it too<br /><br />Every time we change, it’s difficult to get an understanding. But it’s not difficult to understand. The system that we have taken for this international competition is nothing worse or nothing less than a normal league system as applied to clubs, everywhere in every country<br /><br />Of course, everyone has a point of view and the point of view of a club manager is not necessarily the same as a coach of a national team. This is a very meaningful competition for sure<br /><br />You always have to learn lessons. There is nothing which is perfect and everything is open to improvement. We will definitely be debriefing about the Nations League, thinking about the future. We will never stand still. Whenever there is something to improve, to make the competition better, we will go for it. We will be brainstorming about the Nations League. We will try to identify if there is anything we can do to make it even better<br /><br />The Nations League has been accommodated comfortably in the dates of the international match calendar. We don’t anticipate any possible change. Of course, the calendar can also be optimised but the space for national teams will be there. And we are just planning ahead for the future to have the Nations League which is established now. And definitely one of the must-haves in the international landscape<br /><br /><b>[When asked to give the inaugural competition a score out of 10]</b> Can I say 10?! It’s not me saying that. I have read many, many pieces about the Nations League. The media are usually very demanding and I’ve seen widespread praise for the Nations League from different countries, coming from many sources, different journalists. If this is what the opinion leaders think, the media thinks and the fans think, then it’s very good. At UEFA, we are very happy that the Nations League has been introduced and we are very happy that all matches count for national teams. It’s a good asset to look after</p>
