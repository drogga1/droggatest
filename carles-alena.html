  <p><b>[After being named in the NxGn as one of the world’s 50 best teenagers born in 1998 or after]</b> I’m doing well and I try to handle the situation with normality. I assume that my job is to play for the youth team, even though there may be times when I am with the first team. I’m delighted with the situation, working very hard and without thinking about that goal I scored. I prefer to go game by game, without reading the press or taking much notice of what people say. I just want to go day by day, helping my team-mates and receiving their support. I think that is the right path to ensure that things work out well.<br /><br /><b>[Alena is left-footed, but is currently playing on the right side of the midfield for Barca B]</b> That’s where I like playing best - as an ‘interior’ a pierna cambiada <b>[on the other foot]</b>, so that I can cut inside. I try to feel good wherever I play, but if you ask me, that’s the position I like the best<br /><br /><b>[On Diego Maradona]</b> They don’t say that so much now. It’s something that started in the cadete team because I was left-footed and I had the same hairstyle, but I don’t identify myself with him when I’m playing. I don’t have the same profile as him, but I always took it as a compliment. In any case, I don’t think we can be compared!<br /><br />Rivaldo was my idol when I was little. Then there was Deco, who played in my position. Now I look a lot at Andres Iniesta, just like I did with Xavi before. That’s the type of profile that interests me, in order to learn and translate that on the field of play.<br /><br />I want to stay here and reach the first team - that’s clear. But in football you never know. It’s a world in which a lot of things change and I know I could end up somewhere else. But my objective is to be here for many more years</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona’s primary objective is to win the Champions League this season]</b> Yes, it is clear that the Champions League is a thorn that is stuck in our side. Last year, because of the way they <b>[Roma]</b> eliminated us… it was a little unfair because your awful game comes the day you least expect it. And it was a good year to have been able to win it. And, because of the way they eliminated us, this year it is like a main objective. People are excited about the Champions League and we, too, have not won it for a few years, so it’s a main objective.<br /><br />You cannot forget La Liga because every year that we’ve won the Champions League, we’ve also won that. You cannot let go of it because it is the most important and the most regular competition, there is also the Copa del Rey, but the Champions League is the main objective of the dressing room</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Carles Alena has insisted that the club’s doors are always open for Neymar to return]</b> He is one of the best players in the world, this club would always have their doors open to that type of player. Of course we would want him to return to the club, he would improve our team, our results and the players.<br /><br />Ousmane Dembele? He is a full member of the squad, the mistakes have been reported and they have been internally sorted out, but we need to help him as with every player. When you come into this club from abroad it is not always easy to adapt, but this is a dressing room who will help him nurture and develop his talent<br /><br />Atletico Madrid? It is a very challenging and important game for us, we need to bounce back from <b>[the defeat against]</b> Real Betis</p>

  <p><b>[On Messi]</b> My words have run out for Messi and I’ve only worked closely with him for a year. He’s number one, there are no comparisons. They’ve all finished. There are no more Ballons d’Or, nor is he the fifth best in the world. People think it’s a joke but it’s reality. He’s the best and he has been for 12 years</p>

But I had a very good relationship because of everything he has done for me. I hope that we meet in the future. I called him to say goodbye. He knew that I wanted to go. At the start of December, I was pretty sure. He knew that my decision was almost taken. They were complicated months, but in no moment was there a bad relationship with the coach. He decided that and he rules. I tried to get back as soon as possible, and it took a few months. It surprises you, annoys you and pissed you off a bit</p>
