I would have liked a message from the board because they promised him the number without notifying me. That left a bad taste, it didn’t feel good. I’ve always behaved well with the club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> midfielder Carles Alena admits it would hurt to see Neymar join fierce rivals Real Madrid]</b> It would hurt if Neymar went to our eternal rival, especially after playing <b>[for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b>. We hope that he comes back. He’s a spectacular player, one of the best in the world. If he comes back it would be an amazing signing, it would be an incredible way to close the transfer window. He would make us all better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> midfielder Carles Alena has suggested he would be open to joining Real Madrid]</b> Football has many turns. I’ve been a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fan all my life. It would be tough, but they’ve always taught me ‘never say never’. But, for me, they are a rival team<br /><br /><b>[despite being frustrated with his lack of game time, he insists there is no bad blood with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> boss Valverde]</b> <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a> never told me why he didn’t call me up. But I had a very good relationship because of everything he has done for me. I hope that we meet in the future. I called him to say goodbye. He knew that I wanted to go. At the start of December, I was pretty sure. He knew that my decision was almost taken. They were complicated months, but in no moment was there a bad relationship with the coach. He decided that and he rules. I tried to get back as soon as possible, and it took a few months. It surprises you, annoys you and p***** you off a bit</p>
