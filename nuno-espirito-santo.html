  <p><b>[Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo has said that his side are not looking at the table]</b> There’s no reference to the table, the reference is to grow, to improve game by game. Every game is a chance to improve. We have a fantastic opportunity to become a better team, trying new things, but at the same time trying to make players grow on the idea that we want regarding the future. This is what we focus on until the end, there’s no thinking about the summer or next season, it’s a game by game process. It’s a clear idea that we’ve been building since day one. We started in the Championship, nothing has changed. There’s no reference of the table, it’s a squad and group of people who want to work together and improve every day.<br /><br />It’s not a question of tiredness. Yes, it’s a small squad. We started with 18 players, two went out on loan (in January), and we stayed with 16 plus the goalkeepers, with the back-up of the Under-23s. Why we did it is because we believe that the more time they spend together, and the more chance they have to compete together, they will become better. It’s a belief</p>

The reason is they enjoy working together so we don’t have to achieve anything to retain them. At no point am I thinking about it. We don’t think about that (the top four). There’s no race for anything, the race is to compete, improve and make good games. This is the challenge for every team in this moment. I’m very proud of the work we have been doing. We have begun to build something, we did the right things and we are still in a building process. We have achieved important and remarkable things but still have a long way to go, there is still a lot of room to improve. When we started we didn’t know what was in front of us but we know we had a fantastic club to take care of and try to become as huge as it was in its past history<br /><br />I expect Villa to be very difficult because they have good players. The table doesn’t mean anything, in this mini tournament we have anything is possible. We look at Villa as a strong opponent. I appreciate Dean (Smith), I respect him a lot.

  <p><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> to wait until summer for <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> shoulder surgery decision]</b> I don’t know. During this period when we didn’t compete, Adama was able to do a special programme for his shoulder. What happened in the game was a setback, but he is able to deal with the pain, he is able to deal with the competition side of the game. You can see that he is almost normal. It is something that he has to overcome mentally and after, we have to address it in a proper way. But I’m totally confident that for now, he’s okay. It’s something that we have to decide together. I think he needs a scan, he needs to have a good opinion from the doctor and then we’ll decide. What is important now is that he’s okay, struggling of course because the pain is there, but he’s been able to compete.<br /><br />We must be proud of how we have done things. The ‘how’ is very important with us. There are still games to go, let’s focus on that. Sometimes it’s important not to lose the perspective of things. There are some moments when you are able to see things over all the time we have been working together - it’s almost three years now - so let’s keep on being together and improving.</p>
