Nuno Espirito Santo accepts the limitations of his squad before the China trip but has talked up the importance of the matches to his team]</b> It going to be tough because we have a very short squad - we brought a lot of boys, U18s to help us. We prepare ourselves, but at the same time we are in a different environment, so we have to be flexible, patient. The Asia Trophy is very important, a very good competition. It’s one more step in preparation for the season ahead</p>

Manchester City failed to collect their first trophy of the 2019-20 season after losing the Premier League Asia Trophy final to Wolves on penalties. Following a goalless draw in Shanghai on Saturday, Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio saved three penalties to seal a 3-2 shoot-out victory for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side</p>

I don’t know how they’re going to solve it, I gave my opinion to it, but it’s the emotion. You celebrate a goal and it’s such a beautiful moment, so when you are stood in silence waiting for it, don’t take that away from the people, because it’s the most important moment in football. I was hoping <b>[Neves would score]</b>, not expecting, because he’s fantastic. He has this technique of kicking the ball, he’s done it sometimes before, but he has to do it over and over again because this is what counts<br /><br /><b>[Nuno’s men beat United at home in both the league and FA Cup last term and the head coach praised another high-class home performance from his side]</b> I am proud of all the performance because this is what matters in this moment of the competition. It was a game of emotion, this is what Molineux enjoys and we have to thank them <b>[the fans]</b> so much because the atmosphere when we get control of the game and create chances, they really push us, amazing. Let’s do what we do, play with the energy we should play with, embrace the challenge and fight for the game. The boys fought for every single ball, it was so good, I’m very proud of them</p>

He’s a young and talented player that we brought here with high expectations, but it didn’t work out. It’s time for him to go and find a club where he can play and keep on progressing because the talent is there. It’s based on reality. He had moments that he played, moments that he performed well, and some moments he didn’t perform well. That’s the case of Vallejo. Clearly, it didn’t work out. When things don’t work out, you have to look at yourself as a coaching staff. How can you make things work for the best?

The fans are what make things have sense and, if the fans are not happy, that’s a bad sign.

I don’t mention names, but we need and are going to bring in players, for sure. The idea is players that can bring new solutions. I’m aware of things, we think, we decide, and things take time, but no frustration at all. It’s a problem and this is not the best window to do things, it’s not the best time to operate in the market, but we need players. The way we work is not going to change</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Espirito Santo not phased by claims <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Raul Jimenez</a> should join Manchester United]</b> It’s not an issue for us, we have a competition and a game to play. We have a lot of things in front of us. It’s not the moment to think about anything else. I’m sure Raul is totally, 100 per cent focused on what he has to do at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. They are things which you can’t control, it’s up to you to decide if you pay attention or not. I admire Tata (Martino), he is a big manager, and honestly it doesn’t distract us</p>

  <p><b>[John Egan’s 93rd-minute winner earned <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> a crucial 1-0 victory that kept their European dream alive and dented Wolves’ in the process]</b> It could have gone both ways, they had chances, we had chances. It’s hard to create chances against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, they press really high and that requires different things from us as a team. But we created chances with clear counter attacks where we should have done better. In the end it looked it was going to finish <b>[with a point]</b> but we didn’t stay focused. We must defend better at the corner</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Espirito Santo has been named <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> manager of the month for June]</b> We are pleased with the award, but as you know, the words are for all the group, especially for the medical staff who allowed us to return safely in a good way. They are our true heroes because what they have done behind the scenes was huge for us and that was what made it possible for us to compete well in the return of the competition, so this reward is for them</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves to wait until summer for <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> shoulder surgery decision]</b> I don’t know. During this period when we didn’t compete, Adama was able to do a special programme for his shoulder. What happened in the game was a setback, but he is able to deal with the pain, he is able to deal with the competition side of the game. You can see that he is almost normal. It is something that he has to overcome mentally and after, we have to address it in a proper way. But I’m totally confident that for now, he’s okay. It’s something that we have to decide together. I think he needs a scan, he needs to have a good opinion from the doctor and then we’ll decide. What is important now is that he’s okay, struggling of course because the pain is there, but he’s been able to compete.<br /><br />We must be proud of how we have done things. The ‘how’ is very important with us. There are still games to go, let’s focus on that. Sometimes it’s important not to lose the perspective of things. There are some moments when you are able to see things over all the time we have been working together - it’s almost three years now - so let’s keep on being together and improving.</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves brushed aside <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> 3-0 at Molineux on Sunday with new boy Daniel Podence shining on his first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> start for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side]</b> You are in pain (after a defeat) but you stand up the next morning and you have to go again. That is the game. We had a lot of actions today and didn’t concede too many chances, it’s always about trying to upgrade and raise the standards<br /><br />It was not our main objective (keeping in touch with the top four), there were things we should improve. It’s not about that, it’s about trying to create and raise standards so we become a better team. Our finishes were not so good, look at the chances we had. Adama is not going to have an easier one</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Wood’s 96th-minute penalty secured a 1-1 draw for <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> to dent Wolves’ Champions League hopes]</b> We had plenty of the ball and created some great situations and it was a fantastic goal from Raul. It’s always hard to take <b>[…]</b> every goal you concede is hard to take and a goal in the final moments is even harder. I always felt we were in control and the team played well. Sometimes, justice doesn’t exist in the game, this is football. The players completed well but we have to now focus on the next game. I don’t live based on ifs, I live based on reality and the reality is to prepare for the next game. I’ll only be thinking about that</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Espirito Santo insists <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> will continue to develop amid Champions League ambition]</b> I think we are improving and always trying to become better, knowing it is a difficult season of ups and downs. But I think we will always be able to react to the not so good performances and bounce back and play good after those games. It is always the same and has been this way since three seasons ago. I think it is a long process of building and improving and we are still on the way<br /><br />It is important to improve but it will be tough, because it is a good team with good players, quality players, and we expect a really tough game. We will focus on the team of Crystal Palace and try to be organised. I think it is the best way to approach it.</p>
