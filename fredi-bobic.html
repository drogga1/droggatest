  <p><b>[VfB Stuttgart tracking more J-League players]</b> The family background is one important criteria to see if someone fits at VfB. Besides, when you look the player in the eyes, you can instantly see if someone has the fire in his eyes needed. With Shinji Okazaki, for instance, that was the case</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt have not received any offers for star striker Ante Rebic]</b> I am very happy about the success of Ante Rebic with the Croatian national team. The players and the coaching team are watching the World Cup games together in the training camp in the USA and, of course, are especially excited about Ante. So far, there are no offers available and we’re planning a steady season with Ante Rebic for the new season. Of course we know that a lot can happen when a big club makes an offer. We cannot compete economically with the big ones, but that’s nothing new.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil has been labelled a coward by Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director Fredi Bobic]</b> I think that’s a bit cowardly. Ozil’s criticism of social media, especially in the direction of the German Football Association <b>[DFB]</b>, is unbearable. This blanket charge of racism simply does not correspond to reality. He could have given an interview somewhere, live on TV. For us footballers, the rule is ‘be a man and stand up.’<br /><br /><b>[Bobic believes that Ozil’s photo with Erdogan, which he has defended, was a severe mistake]</b> I would allow that to a player who is 18 or 19 years old, but a player who has been in the business for so long, 29 years old and world champion, needs to know what this looks like. If he does not know that, then he is either totally naive - I cannot imagine that - or it is calculating and he wanted to be provocative, or else he is alienated, of course, I understand the two hearts that beat in his chest, but nevertheless, you must know that you have a great responsibility</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Rebic has put an end to speculation regarding his future at Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> Ante was certainly one of the most positive stars of the World Cup and we do not have to hide the fact that he awakened interest. It speaks for Eintracht Frankfurt that we have managed to keep such a strong player, who can certainly be described as a high flyer. Ante was wooed by some of the top clubs and had one or two better overseas offers, but staying with us shows that he has the Eagles in his heart and that we are on the right path with our plans, that we have taken another step forward in terms of cost-effectiveness and can keep top players. With his dynamism and speed, he fits perfectly into the system of our coach Adi Hutter. It was important for us to keep his qualities in our ranks. For many Eintracht fans, Ante is a figure of honour - not least because of his two beautiful goals in the DFB-Pokal final - and will have been keeping their fingers crossed to hear this great news.</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director Fredi Bobic has cooled speculation surrounding star striker Luka Jovic]</b> He’s developing, he’s great, he’s scoring a lot of goals. What do I know? We’ll see about that, but nothing in February, and now in March, because even the big clubs have to look first. Will they be league champions? Do they play Champions League? It will be decided much later when they’ve made big offers. I’m not worried. First of all, let’s see if we can achieve something this season, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br /><b>[Bundesliga rivals Bayern are also believed to be interested in signing Jovic]</b> I do not know. I do not know what’s going on behind my back, I can only say that officially there’s been no contact <b>[between Bayern and Frankfurt]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director Fredi Bobic insists the Bundesliga club have had no offers for Luka Jovic]</b> Nothing has happened, absolutely nothing. Soon we will trigger the purchase option in his deal. An offer for Luka has not been made available to us. We know that the player is being watched by the big clubs in Europe. That’s fact. That talks about the player take place in the background, is also obvious. That is normal. Due to his age and performance, Luka is currently the hottest product in Europe. I’m in good talks with his agency. We all, including Luka, are focusing on the final spurt <b>[of the season]</b>. We can still achieve a lot. And Luka really feels like scoring goals in the Bundesliga and Europa League.<br /><br />Honestly, yes. They are bound by contract, that’s one thing. On the other hand, the boys feel comfortable here. They have fun. There’s a big gang with the club and the fans. They enjoy it at Eintracht. Of course, we know that they are in demand. But we do not put anyone in the shop window</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> worried about coronavirus ending the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season early]</b> A premature end of the season would of course not be a positive thing. It would be a major economic loss for all clubs and also for <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>. We will do everything we can to ensure that we can continue to play football. It’s not just about the money, but also about jobs in the club and around it. Many people are directly and indirectly involved with football and live from it. Football is a huge industry. In addition, we naturally want to do our bit at some point to ensure that people start talking about other things than the coronavirus. That is what sport is all about. It’s like the gladiators in the past: bread and games. But it must be safe and not harmful to health. That’s why we wait and see what the virologists and doctors tell us. We should listen to them. If the season were to end, it would hit a lot of people very hard. Like many small and medium-sized enterprises<br /><br />They’re doing all right, considering the circumstances. We’ll have the rest of the test results soon. Therefore it is possible that one of the other players is positive as well. But both players are doing well so far. They show the typical symptoms, but it is not a critical condition. The doctors assured me that. And they both still have their sense of humour. Once you’ve had contact with them, it encourages you. I hope they both come out of this okay. And I don’t think they’ll be the only two who will get it. Unfortunately, there will probably be others involved - just like with any other team</p>

They’ve followed the rules in the last weeks, they’ve done a lot for the community, especially for the elders. So we are confident, we are in good communication with the fan groups and the signal from the fans is very positive that they won’t show up at the stadium. That’s the right thing to do. It’s not allowed. We’ve re-opened a lot of things, but that’s not allowed, big groups. Don’t show up at the stadium, it makes no sense</p>
