  <p><b>[VfB Stuttgart tracking more J-League players]</b> The family background is one important criteria to see if someone fits at VfB. Besides, when you look the player in the eyes, you can instantly see if someone has the fire in his eyes needed. With Shinji Okazaki, for instance, that was the case</p>

He improved our game significantly when he joined last January. He’s also a local lad, and we’ve always said we’ll try and bring players like that to the club. The fact we’ve been able to do that shows we’re taking the next step in our development</p>

But he was no longer satisfied with his playing role, so we agreed to his request to change</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt worried about coronavirus ending the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season early]</b> A premature end of the season would of course not be a positive thing. It would be a major economic loss for all clubs and also for Eintracht Frankfurt. We will do everything we can to ensure that we can continue to play football. It’s not just about the money, but also about jobs in the club and around it. Many people are directly and indirectly involved with football and live from it. Football is a huge industry. In addition, we naturally want to do our bit at some point to ensure that people start talking about other things than the coronavirus. That is what sport is all about. It’s like the gladiators in the past: bread and games. But it must be safe and not harmful to health. That’s why we wait and see what the virologists and doctors tell us. We should listen to them. If the season were to end, it would hit a lot of people very hard. Like many small and medium-sized enterprises<br /><br />They’re doing all right, considering the circumstances. We’ll have the rest of the test results soon. Therefore it is possible that one of the other players is positive as well. But both players are doing well so far. They show the typical symptoms, but it is not a critical condition. The doctors assured me that. And they both still have their sense of humour. Once you’ve had contact with them, it encourages you. I hope they both come out of this okay. And I don’t think they’ll be the only two who will get it. Unfortunately, there will probably be others involved – just like with any other team</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director Fredi Bobic warned his team’s fans not to show up when <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> games resume – or they will cost their side points]</b> We talked a lot with our own fans at Frankfurt and said, ‘Listen guys, don’t show up at the stadium. If you show up at the stadium, we will lose this game because the rules are very strict.’ If they show up, the result goes to the away team. <b>[The fans]</b> are smart, though. They’ve followed the rules in the last weeks, they’ve done a lot for the community, especially for the elders. So we are confident, we are in good communication with the fan groups and the signal from the fans is very positive that they won’t show up at the stadium. That’s the right thing to do. It’s not allowed. We’ve re-opened a lot of things, but that’s not allowed, big groups. Don’t show up at the stadium, it makes no sense</p>
