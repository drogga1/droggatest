We know that it will be a difficult game, but from now until the end they will all be finals these matches: we must play like we did many other times.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Roma goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli has hit out at those who have criticised current Lupi shot-stopper Alexander Doni, claiming the Brazilian is excellent]</b> I have seen what’s going at Roma. There is no patience among the fans. They are always in a rush and they want to win. I don’t understand why this is. I think Doni is an excellent ‘keeper. He has done well at Roma. Recently he has had some physical problems, but he hasn’t lost his abilities</p>
