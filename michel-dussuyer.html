  <p><b>[Former Guinea boss Michel Dussuyer says <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> definitely has enough quality to succeed in the Premier League]</b> For him to blossom today, he simply needs to put together a run of performances and to get some rhythm. He certainly has enough quality to express himself in this magnificent league. <b>[Naby has]</b> enormous technical qualities, but not only that. He doesn’t have a massive frame, but he’s capable of compensating with a lot of energy, of breaking the lines, of being decisive with his final pass. He’s a player who belongs at this high level, but it’s hard to express yourself when you’re so often halted, this is the problem he has at the moment with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he’s so often injured. I’m obviously not well placed to know the reason for these repetitive injuries. I think he must have enough people around him of quality to manage these problems, but either way, it’s a problem which is putting the brakes on his ability to express himself at the moment.</p>
