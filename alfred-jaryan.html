<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alfred Jaryan shed some light on his disappointment at not being able to play the game]</b> The final game was very important for us. I was extremely disappointed that I was not able to play. But we’ve been a team in all meanings and my friends gave their very best. I spoke with them before the game and they said they will do anything to win the trophy and we did.<br /><br />I can adapt very easily. Even last season, I played more as an attacking midfielder behind Joel Sunday. I never considered myself as a proper striker. Also, I had played in midfield for my country’s U17 and U23 teams. So I know how it is <b>[to be playing in midfield]</b>. I put the idea forward and the club gave me a chance<br /><br />Being the captain, I took on the responsibility and made it a point to communicate with him <b>[Al Amna]</b> right from the start. He is an experienced player and had a great season. We got together very well on the field and even off the field, we were close. Obviously, I listened to him and learnt from his experience as well. We shared our knowledge with each other<br /><br />The game against DSK <b>[Shivajians]</b> at home was my favourite game. <b>[Mahmoud]</b> Al Amna got injured and he told me, ‘You have to lead’. I put in extra work in that game and we won in the final minute</p>
