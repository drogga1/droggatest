  <p><b>[Pedri - The ‘new Iniesta’ that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> moved quickly to sign]</b> I have always cared little about age. I look more at the attitude and performance that the player gives. Last year, when me and my staff arrived <b>[at Las Palmas]</b>, we saw youth matches and we thought that if <b>[Pedri]</b> was able to do the same with professionals, he could be era-defining.<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has made a good investment. He understands the spaces very well, when he has to go inside and leave space on the outside or when to realise you have numerical superiorities in certain areas of the pitch. Everything he does with the ball, he understands the placement and how to make things easier for his team-mates with his simple game. He is able to see that pass between lines that takes out opponents, and he does not need many touches to find those plays. Despite his age and having few games in professional football, he is able to see, always with his head up, all the options he has, and he always chooses the best one.<br /><br />Pedri can play in either of the two positions, although you have to take into account that he feels more comfortable on the left - a bit like <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>. Pedri is very similar to <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, in fact. He will fit perfectly at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He can grow even more because he makes those around him better. He also stands out more when quality football players are around him</p>
