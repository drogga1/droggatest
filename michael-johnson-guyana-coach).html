<blockquote>
  <p>[Guyana feeling no pressure against USMNT after historic Gold Cup qualification] It was an amazing moment for everybody involved - staff, players, the fans, the country. It was a surreal moment. When the whistle blew, the stadium usually holds maximum 2,000-3,000. There were 5,000 in the stadium, and still more coming in on the final whistle. What was so emotional was at the end, everybody ran onto the pitch and in front of you there were grown men, women, children crying because this is a moment they’d waited for all their lives - to see their men’s team qualify for a major tournament, obviously with all the trappings that brings.<br /><br />We’re under no illusion. It’s a fantastic team we’re going up against. But the pressure is on them. We have no pressure whatsoever. Everybody says we’re fortunate to be here, I’ve heard people say they’ll be looking to score a goal and might win a game. So, all the pressure is on the States. That’s what makes it such a beautiful game is the unpredictability of it, is that on any given day we can beat them. If they have an off day, then there’s an opportunity for us to really capture it and do something special</p>

  <p>[USMNT vs Guyana. Michael Johnson say his team will not show fear] We’ll show no fear. We didn’t come this far to not go out on the pitch and give our best, so expect the boys to have a go at the USA. I’ve seen statements that don’t give us a chance, written us off; we won’t score a goal, easy game for America. But internally, I think there is an inner belief and a real resilience that that’s the case and I think that’s where the pressure comes from us in our own environment, thinking we can do a lot better than the so-called armchair pundits, press, players from America and coaching staff have said</p>
