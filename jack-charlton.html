  <p><b>[Following the goalless draw with Egypt in the group stages of Italia ‘90, Ireland’s manager - the 1966 World Cup-winning former England defender Jack Charlton - was asked which of the Egyptian players had caught his eye]</b> I couldn’t tell you. I don’t know any of their names. There was the guy with the beard, the dark lad in midfield, the little dark lad who played centre midfield, the very coloured boy, and the boy who played up front</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Charlton: A World Cup hero with England and Ireland]</b> There’s a picture of me at the end down on my knees. I don’t remember if I was saying a prayer or just knackered. I had chased after <a href="geoff-hurst.html">Geoff Hurst</a> to give him a hug and chased our kid (Bobby) to give him a hug and then collapsed to my knees, so I suppose I must have been knackered</p>

  <p><b>[A statement from the Charlton family]</b> Jack died peacefully on Friday 10 July at the age of 85. He was at home in Northumberland, with his family by his side. As well as a friend to many, he was a much-adored husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. We cannot express how proud we are of the extraordinary life he led and the pleasure he brought to so many people in different countries and from all walks of life. He was a thoroughly honest, kind, funny and genuine man who always had time for people. His loss will leave a huge hole in all our lives but we are thankful for a lifetime of happy memories.<br /><br />We are devastated by the news that Jack Charlton, a member of our World Cup-winning team of 1966, has passed away. Our deepest sympathies are with Jack’s family, friends and former clubs</p>
