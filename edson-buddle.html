  <p><b>[Former United States national team forward Edson Buddle told Goal he used to hide the fact he was a soccer player]</b> Those little details in the corporate world outside soccer, I just maybe didn’t pay attention or was just so focused on working with my dad that I didn’t even think about how to go about becoming a coach in MLS<br /><br /><b>[Already during his playing days, Buddle says, he had to become accustomed to being the only black person in the room]</b> You can’t reach maximum potential if you’re trying to act like you’re someone else. That hinders who you are on the field. Then, you need a coach that kind of looks like you to inspire you. I’d use Ruud Gullilt as an example. He played my position, and not just looks, he’s a black guy, but I had him on my wall. He taught me a few things <b>[…]</b> and all of a sudden I’m scoring all these goals. Not having someone who looks like you on the top, kind of hinders the people on the bottom. It’s like, I’m not going to be a head coach or I’m never going to be the poster child of U.S. Soccer because he doesn’t look like me. You just kind of quit. You’re so close but you quit because you feel inferior because the people up top don’t look like you</p>
