  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet has endured another testing campaign at Liverpool but insists he has no intention of seeking a move away from the club]</b> It’s a good thing. Every time when there’s been competition in my career I’ve got stronger. It’s important to have that, especially at a big club like Liverpool. Loris played well at Southampton. But it’s not that I feel like I have to prove something now. Maybe a few years back I’d have been thinking ‘one mistake and I could be out’ but I don’t think like that any more. I just think about my own performance and how I can help the team. Last year I signed a contract for five-and-a-half years. That says it all. I am here to be No 1 and I want to stay here.</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet has last laugh as Liverpool show their teeth against Chelsea]</b> I had a chance to save the ball and I’m happy with that. I didn’t hear the whistle and he hits it early, which is a difficult feeling because it was a good free kick in the end. But obviously you want to be given a chance to save it.<br /><br /><b>[Denying Costa was his sixth penalty save of the 14 he’s faced at the club]</b> I am happy about the performance. I think it was obvious we played against an outstanding strong, outstanding experienced side. I thought we did well, from the first second we were in the game and were aggressive. It felt a little bit to me tonight like <b>[in the]</b> red shirt, we played with readiness, passion, will, greed against experience and coolness, and that’s quite difficult<br /><br />The feeling is that you’re disappointed and if you do that against Chelsea, who are leading the Premier League, getting a lot of points, playing good football then it shows how hungry we are in the dressing room. I think we deserved three points</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet admits he will always be fighting for his Liverpool place]</b> Everyone will see the numbers and think I am fighting this guy and this guy. But that isn’t how it is. I’m fighting against Manuel Neuer, Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, Joe Hart, Iker Casillas. I know all those names are going to be flying around, I know what I did this season will be forgotten. I’m not fighting against the guys in the dressing room. I’m fighting against myself. There is no point gauging what is going to be around me. I’m never going to look at them if something is going on around me. I have shown that I can deal with it. I’ll be coming back to show it again.<br /><br />As a goalkeeper, you are on your own and even now, after a solid season, the rumours are starting again with Casillas. I’m 29 now. I know what happens when you are the Liverpool goalkeeper. Whether you have good performances, shit performances, the scrutiny is always there. Always<br /><br />Yeah, inside I got angry. I don’t think anyone on the planet doesn’t get angry! But I can never show it to the outside world. The minute when he told me there was this sudden rush of disappointment. I didn’t get it. This was the worst moment I had, worse than when Brendan dropped me for Brad Jones. There wasn’t really anything where I could blame myself as before with Brendan you can accept there were points when you could have done this, this or this better. After I was dropped that time, I just kept asking myself ‘why?’ but the only way to deal with it was to put my head down and get on with it. I was determined to show myself in the best possible light. The last few months have given me a lot more settlement here. I understand things now and I can deal with it</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet says Liverpool are hungry for silverware]</b> It <b>[the top-four finish]</b> gives us the platform again to go for that trophy next year and this is what I want and what the lads in the dressing room want. Last year, we had the chance to play in two finals, but unfortunately we lost both of them. We have learned from that and I think everybody - not only the players, but also the fans and everybody connected with Liverpool Football Club - is really hungry for silverware. That’s what we have to challenge for next year.<br /><br />The European nights at Anfield are brilliant. I experienced games against Real Madrid in the Champions League when we were last in it and obviously we had big nights in the Europa League against Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund. They were both very special and everybody here is very pleased to know we will have more European games to look forward to next season</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet insists he will not leave Liverpool]</b> No, always the only thing you try to do is prove every time in training you are ready for when the chance comes along. It is never easy of course because I have never in my career spent time on the bench, but it is how it is and the only thing you can do is try to change it but it is never easy. I’ve had a few conversations with the manager already and we have spoken about numerous things. I’m always open and he’s always open, you know how he is, but at this time it is not the time and place to do that <b>[ask to leave]</b>. I still have a contract for three years and, at the moment, I have to focus on the current season. There are still a lot of matches to play. We have games in the Premier League and Champions League.<br /><br />I try to stay professional, try to work as hard as I can and show that I’m ready for when the chance comes. That’s the only thing that you can do and then it’s up to the manager to give you the nod. It can happen very quickly that I will be able to come back into the goal by an injury or suspension.</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet is planning to make a decision on his Liverpool future after representing Belgium at the 2018 World Cup]</b> I don’t know what the future holds for me. I have three years left on my contract at Liverpool. Of course I want to play. The coach knows that, and I have talked about it with him. I will think about my future after the World Cup. I keep focused, just in case. An injury, a suspension, anything can happen and change the course of a season. I stay professional in order to be ready<br /><br /><b>[On seeing Karius edge ahead of him at Anfield]</b> I was disappointed. In football, it’s rare to get a clear answer, but sometimes you have to let things go. I know that becoming number one again won’t be easy. I mustn’t let my head drop. I have always worked and I continue to do so. The boys in the squad even tell me to calm things down in terms of the amount of work I do, but it’s in my nature</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mignolet opens up about Liverpool future]</b> They said ‘Simon we need you at the hotel’. The goalkeeper was taken ill and they asked me would I give it a go. I did and we kept a clean sheet, won the game and after that I had my best times at Sunderland. That shows you how things can change<br /><br />It’s frustrating, of course, because you want to be a part of it. But you have to fight to be a part of the team. Unfortunately, it’s a part of football that you have to accept the decision of the manager when you’re not playing, no matter how difficult it might be. After that it’s about the team and the club and trying to push them forward<br /><br />It’s a different challenge for goalkeepers. It’s more about being mentally ready and confident to step in when you are needed. I can’t say to the gaffer ‘well I haven’t played for three months, I’m not ready!’ That doesn’t work. I have to work as I would, or even harder probably in training so that if anything happens I am 100 per cent ready to come in. From my perspective it’s about supporting the rest of the lads, from the bench and in the dressing room. It’s not easy because you want to be part of it, but at the same time you don’t want to make the atmosphere difficult, or make things harder for the lads who are playing. I just try to focus on my own job, work hard in training. And by doing that I am hopefully ensuring that everybody stays on their toes and that adds a little bit to the team<br /><br />That’s how life is. The outside world will always see it as a rivalry. But we are team-mates. We have the same objective. Wardy <b>[Danny Ward]</b> said it at the beginning of the season, our job is to give Liverpool the best goalkeeper they can have. And that means not one, not two, but the whole goalkeeping department. You can only do that by working hard, pushing each other on. After that it’s up to the manager to pick the team<br /><br />I do feel I played my part. I go back to last season, the winter time. It was not sure that we would reach the top four. We had to fight a lot of hard battles and dig deep. I remember those games away from home, Watford, Stoke, West Brom. We had to get through those games, and I played my part in that. Then we had Hoffenheim <b>[in the qualifying round]</b>, and that was tough. Away from home in that first 30 minutes, anything could have happened. I saved a penalty, we were under the cosh, but we got the job done. And ever since, we have played a really good tournament<br /><br />Since we started the Champions League campaign, we knew we could go far. We’re a cup team. Over two legs, we have shown we can cope with it. We said from the beginning that we can beat anyone and that we don’t need to be scared of anyone, especially with the quality we have up front. Over two legs, that gives us a great chance in any tie. We’ve seen that in us reaching the semi-finals. And hey, once you’re in the semi-finals, you don’t want it to end do you?<br /><br /><b>[On Salah]</b> When he came, everybody knew he was a good player, but not many thought he was going to bang in the goals he has - as a winger, also! Why he’s so unbelievable, for me, is that first of all he plays on the wing yet he comes in and scores all these goals. And secondly, he also holds the ball up really well, which is special for a guy who is not the tallest. He is very strong on his feet, you can’t get the ball from him even with his back to goal, and that makes it a lot easier for the defence to give him the ball and then push up after that. His work rate too, is spot on. Like Bobby and Sadio, they are as important defensively as offensively for us.<br /><br /><b>[On Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane]</b> All three of them love their football, and love working hard. You can see that in the games they play, and it’s the same in training. Sometimes with a superstar, you might think they take it easy in training but it is definitely the opposite with those three. They enjoy every second of football they can play, every goal they can score, at whatever stage it might be. They are always 100 per cent in training. Facing them every day is not only a joy but, from my perspective, a big challenge. You can learn a lot from players like that<br /><br /><b>[On Virgil van Dijk]</b> He was worth the wait! He’s a leader. He makes sure we’re organised or that we push up, and then his presence physically with high balls is big. He clears the danger before it’s even happened, most of the time!<br /><br />When you are 30 years old, you want to play football. There’s no point saying anything else about that. I don’t like sitting on the bench because I get more nervous there than when I am playing! It’s nothing for me. Of course you want to play, but I have three years of contract and I am a Liverpool player. The only thing I’m thinking about is my training, the big games coming up and the World Cup with Belgium</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet has revealed that captain Jordan Henderson will pick the right music to hype his team-mates up]</b> Hendo is in charge of the music. The moment we arrive in the dressing room after getting off the coach the physios put the playlist on. I don’t get involved but it’s a real mix. Alberto Moreno has his Spanish songs and Roberto Firmino has a couple in Portuguese. We have a certain playlist for just before a game. It’s always the same sequence. The last song that gets played before we step out on to the pitch is ‘God’s Plan. Then it’s down to business</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet feels for fellow Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius]</b> I know how it is. You need a bit of time. The good thing about this final is that he will have the summer to take it and go forward. If he wants to talk then of course I will be there. Every goalkeeper can relate to him. I’ve been in this situation before myself and those kind of things you deal with yourself. The only thing I told him is that there is a reason we got to this final, and why we played in this final, so think about that. But of course it is very difficult to say anything to him and to let him grasp it. He’s only young. I’m sure he will <b>[bounce back]</b>. I think we have all the tools at Liverpool as well to help him with that.<br /><br />When you see the amount of supporters who were behind us throughout the whole campaign, with their special songs, they made something special happen this year. It’s very bitter that we can’t give them something back and not to give them the trophy that they wanted. Together with the fans, together with the rest of the club. I think we play, not as individuals, but as a team, we play as 11 together, we play as a whole squad. Everyone was behind the team from the very first moment we stepped into the Champions League and I think that will be the same going forward. Liverpool stands for unity, Liverpool stands for ‘all together’. I think that will not only be the right ideal for Liverpool, it has always been their history and will always be their future</p>

I’ve always been clear: I want to play. Whether I’m No.2 or No.3 doesn’t matter. Playing time is the most important thing. I haven’t been told anything since Loris left. I don’t know what my future with Liverpool looks like. We shall see what happens this week. I find it strange that Karius was loaned out, while I also had options for a loan. But for some reason that wasn’t possible. A keeper who was made first choice ahead of me last year gets to leave on loan. Strange.</p>

We have got the Huddersfield game to prepare for and I will always be there for the team. That’s the only thing I can do at this moment. I am not thinking about my future at this moment in time. The only thing I can do is wait for my chance and work hard in training. I always try and be ready if I am playing or not playing. I always prepare myself in the same manner and when the opportunity comes along you have to grasp it.<br /><br /><b>[Mignolet is also fighting to prove himself to Belgium manager Ronald Koeman]</b> First of all, I was happy with the opportunity to play again. Then it is a question of making sure you return the favour to the gaffer and show you are there for when he needs you - and I did that</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet is hoping to find a way out of Liverpool during the January]</b> We have to be realistic. There are not many good possible transfers in January, especially not for a goalkeeper. Circumstances have to be right for everybody. If something is to happen in January, it will be very difficult to do something. If Simon goes or could go in January, Liverpool have to look for a replacement as well. So I understand from a club’s point of view that it’s not easy to do. In that respect, we know each other’s problems. We’ll see how and when we can solve them.<br /><br />It’s not because I go to a game - Monaco vs. Brugge - and I’m spotted in Nice and that I’m speaking on behalf of Simon that he goes to Nice. I’ve heard and read all sorts of comments regarding speculation about Simon. The fact of the matter is that Simon is today a Liverpool FC player. There’s no hard feelings whatsoever. Liverpool, they like Simon. And Simon likes Liverpool. The only thing is Simon is a professional football player and a professional football player wants to play. So yes, in that respect, we have been looking and will continue to be looking for a solution for Simon. That’s obvious. I’ve had some talks with Liverpool about it. We know what we can do and can’t do. They know what we want to do. There is not a difficult or frustrating situation for everybody. The only frustration is that Simon doesn’t play. That’s all. That’s something we want to address. Liverpool is aware of that Simon has that ambition to play. Obviously, they are very happy to have two No.1s, but you can only play one. You can’t hold that situation for much longer - that’s for sure. That’s something they realise as well. When and to where Simon will leave, let the future determine that because a lot of things can happen between now and the end of the season. We’re open for everything, but everything will be done in a good relationship, constructive talks and understanding with Liverpool</p>

I hope to help Liverpool win prizes, that’s the most important thing and we’ll see about the rest.<br /><br />As a whole, this is the strongest team I’ve ever experienced at Liverpool. At the back we are very stable with Virgil van Dijk and in the front you have three goalscorers with Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. The latter is also very strong in defending, a very complete attacker. We have a strong team, we are very strong across the board and in the past we also had a strong team with, among others, Steven Gerrard, Phillipe Coutinho and Luis Suarez, but then we were perhaps lacking a little width. It’s been 29 years since Liverpool won the title once again and the fans obviously want that very much. As a group of players, we want to win everything: the Champions League and the Premier League<br /><br />In Liverpool and Belgium I play in two great teams and that is, of course, fantastic to experience. At the moment you do not dwell on that, because you are part of it and you are in the moment. My future as a Red Devil? I haven’t thought about that at all and I will remain available for Liverpool and the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool rival Simon Mignolet says Alisson is the most complete goalkeeper in the world]</b> As a goalkeeper, you learn from the guys you work with. He is Brazil No. 1 ahead of Ederson. The main difference between the two is that Ali is probably better with his hands. He’s the most complete goalkeeper I’ve seen in my career. He is so calm. Not playing is the hard bit, the feeling of being on the pitch at the end when you’ve won is what I miss most. I understand how people who don’t play stop doing their work. That is why I push myself every day. I get to the gym at 9 am. The boys must look at me and think, ‘What’s that idiot doing there again?.<br /><br />The manager is perfect for the club. His vision and his character embodies what the fans live for. The style of play we have is what the supporters want, they want to see fire. They want to see Liverpool pushing, fighting. It would be strange - and very frustrating - if we didn’t win anything, but the only thing that would stop it is the opposition being so good. All credit to them if that is the case. The amount of points we’ve accumulated would mean we are champions in a normal year. We’ve been through the process to get where we want to be and the squad have grown. We should get something one day</p>

I had been at the end of my patience for the past six or seven months<br /><br /><b>[Even with it clear that he was surplus to requirements and that no regular game time would be afforded to him, Mignolet says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> still made it tricky for him to get out]</b> Not difficult? I don’t dare say that!</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet says he left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because he believed he had no chance of getting back into the starting side ahead of Alisson]</b> If I could really fight for my place, I might have stayed. But if I had ended up in goal if Alisson picked up an injury, I would be allowed to push 10 shots out of the box. Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again, and even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still stay <b>[in the starting XI]</b>. What sense did it make for me?<br /><br />No, because I knew that the opportunity existed. I haven’t thought once: ‘Shit, now <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> race and I’m gone’. Of course, I could have stayed with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to earn my money, challenge for the league title and the Champions League. However, as long as you are not on the starting XI yourself, a price feels different. So I would rather play in the starter at <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a> than grabbing the English title as a substitute at Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[When people ask him if he regrets leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the summer]</b> No, I’m really pleased for them! I hope to God they win it! I never doubted them. They are such a good team, so well coached and with such good players. They deserve their success<br /><br />I knew what I was walking away from. But I was comfortable with that. At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, we won the Champions League last season, and I know I played a part in that success even if I didn’t play the games. It will always be a very proud moment for me. But if you ask me honestly, I will say I prefer to win the Belgian League by playing every game. People have said I was an important figure in the dressing room at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, which is nice and is a compliment for sure. But I want to be important on the field as well, and hopefully at <a href="club-brugge.html">Brugge</a> now I am both<br /><br /><b>[Mignolet played twice, once in the League Cup and once in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. The last of his 204 Reds appearances was at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> in January]</b> I think it got to the stage where I had to leave. I had been sitting on the bench for a year and a half, and with Euro 2020 coming up I knew that I needed to be playing regularly if I wanted to be part of the Belgian squad. The more time you spend on the bench, as a No.2 goalkeeper, the harder it is to come back and play at a high level. I believe that. Some people are able to accept being a backup, and that can work for them. But for me, I am not a character who wants to sit on the bench. I want to play, and this summer the opportunity came up to come back to Belgium and it was the right one<br /><br /><b>[He says of Alisson]</b> He’s such a talent. There’s nothing he needs to be taught. You know when you get those people who are just natural at what they do? That’s him. What do they say, ‘You never forget how to ride a bike’? With him, it’s goalkeeping. He picked it up naturally and he never forgot it. That’s what makes him special. His footwork and his temperament are first-class, and I have to say I picked up quite a lot from him when I worked with him. He’s a good guy and a great goalkeeper<br /><br /><b>[Mignolet’s departure was an understated one]</b> I’m not someone for big speeches. In the dressing room afterwards, I just shook the boys’ hands and said goodbye<br /><br /><b>[Club-wise, <a href="club-brugge.html">Brugge</a> look well set to regain the Belgian league crown and Mignolet can enjoy the routine of regular football once more]</b> I think a lot of people in Belgium maybe thought I was happy to sit on the bench, that I wasn’t prepared to challenge myself and compete. That wasn’t true, and never will be. I still have the hunger to play, and I want to show that. I think the benefits of my move were shown in the latest international break when I started the qualifying match against Cyprus. That was because I’m playing, I’m playing well and people can see that</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s achievements this season are unbelievable]</b> Why not? It started when I was still there and was only heading in one direction. Last season we won the Champions League and winning that first trophy was very important for the dressing-room. Once you have that in the bag, you build on it. The hunger is even greater to win trophies and you want to get your hands on the next one<br /><br />The stability is there and, if you’ve got so much quality up front, with Sadio <b>[Mane]</b>, Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> and Roberto <b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>]</b>, then you’re incredibly strong. They are still a relatively young team, and you also see what the reserves did in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, so the basis is there to build for the long-term. I knew <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be challenging for trophies again, but what they’re doing this season is unbelievable and I hope they can win the league as quickly as possible<br /><br />I sat on the bench for about a year-and-a-half. At 31, you’re in the prime of your career as a goalkeeper, so you want to be playing regularly. If I was going to sit on the bench for two more years, I would have been 33. Alisson is such a great keeper, even though I knew he might get injured or suspended.<br /><br />So maybe I’d play five, 10, 15 games a year, but to then try to find a club at 33 and be a regular starter is difficult, so I took the chance to do it now. Although I was very happy to end my time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> by winning the Champions League, you always want to have more of a bigger hand in winning trophies. It’s so much nicer to feel a victory when you’ve been on the pitch, when you’re contributing on a weekly basis, which is what I do now</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet claims to have no regrets at having left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a> in 2019]</b> When I moved over to Belgium, the first couple of weeks, I was in a hotel and organising things, trying to move and the first time when Alisson got injured, I was in my hotel room, filling in some documents, when I suddenly realised that my phone had about 20 or 30 messages. I didn’t know what had happened because I didn’t have Sky in my room. So then I saw that Ali as unfortunately injured. At the same time, I knew that could be the case because he had come back from a long season with the Copa America and of course there is always a risk. I chose to leave not for that because even if I had played <b>[in <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a>’s place]</b> 10 or 15 games, you know when Ali gets back with what he has proven and the level he is at, he will always go back to the starting XI. Even if you play 15 games and keep 15 clean sheets in an unbelievable manner, you would still go back to the bench and that is not the thing I wanted to do at the age of 32. I knew that was a scenario that could pan out, but I still would have made the same decision I did today<br /><br />I had an unbelievable time. First it was like a great gift to me, I would say, to represent the club as big as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that is supported all over the world. When I arrived <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was not in the same shape or position that it is today. When I arrived, the idea was to fight at the top of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Europe and when I left, that is the position they are in. Probably now, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is the best club in Europe. I joined and I was there in the whole process of building the club to what it is now, so it was an unbelievable experience for me, personally to be part of that. Like I said, I thank the club for everything they did for me, the supporters I had and the games I played in. In my time, I played a lot games and I was proud to represent the club every time I did. We had some great moments there and to win the Champions League before I left the club was the icing on the cake</p>

  <p><b>[Mignolet reveals Sunderland scrap between Mensah &amp; <a href="nedum-onuoha.html">Onuoha</a>]</b> John Mensah and <a href="nedum-onuoha.html">Nedum Onuoha</a> were two assertive players in the dressing room, not to mention aggressive. After one of them played a short return pass, the other decided to make amends and make him feel small at half-time. At least that was the intention. Our captain <b>[Lee Cattermole]</b> jumped in and Bruce was called from another room where he was with his coaching staff. Bruce said: ‘Let them have a proper fight. If they want to fight, let them fight.’ There was nothing more than a little pushing and pulling. Bruce said: ‘See now. You are a bunch of pussies in the dressing room and on the field.’<br /><br /><b>[<a href="paolo-di-canio.html">Di Canio</a> arrived with Sunderland fighting relegation, and he was less than impressed by what he found at the club’s training base]</b> Paolo went mad when he first saw the players’ buffet, full of grease.

  <p><b>[<a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a> goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has revealed that news of the side’s Jupiler Pro League win came out of the blue - and via a text message]</b> We got a text message. You can’t really do too much. I drank a glass of champagne with the family and that was it basically. Yes <b>[we feel like champions]</b>. The only difference is that you obviously want to celebrate it on a pitch after a victory and celebrate with your team-mates, the fans, the staff and the club - but we have to accept what time we are in at this moment and that isn’t possible. For me that is more the downside. It was well deserved because we were miles ahead of the rest. We had basically played against every team twice apart from one and, after that, we had so many points that we were clear and were going to be champions one way or another<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve it. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, things can twist and change at the end of the season but with the advantage they have got I don’t see anyone being champion other than my old teammates. I am not surprised with how well they have done. The basis was already set, the team was already formed and the performances were there also just before I left. I think everybody expected them to challenge at the top of the league and they have outperformed the rest of the teams. That would make them well-deserved champions</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Mignolet sees <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> leaders benefitting from heartache]</b> To be honest this season, already I think the basis was set in the winter time last season. We were winning every game at home, we were very tough to beat, we didn’t concede and we were very stable. But, I think if you win something then you get the confidence of trying to be or being unbeatable and looking forward for the next medal you can win. I also think losing in the Europa League final and then the Champions League final will have helped because going through that it’s not nice and it’s not easy, but I think you learn things like that also. It gets you ready for the next final you have to play and I think that also came in handy last year when we had to play a final against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, so I think now the team is mature enough to deal with that<br /><br /><b>[Mignolet was on the bench for that contest, as Alisson figured between the sticks, but the Belgian holds fond memories of a sixth European Cup triumph for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a>]</b> <b>[It was an]</b> amazing feeling. When I arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the aim was to fight again both at the top of the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> and in Europe. Before I left we won the Champions League. It was brilliant and I think we deserved it as well throughout the campaign. For example, the game against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I think we deserved to be crowned Champions League winners and I’m very proud and happy that I was part of it.</p>
