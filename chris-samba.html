  <p><b>[Chris Samba on playing for Congo]</b> I love playing for Congo. When you arrive at the airport and then to the arrivals hall, people physically pick you up and carry you to the waiting car, dancing and singing! It’s just great!</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Samba says Unfortunate <a href="phil-jones.html">Phil Jones</a> deserved big billing at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> Definitely. The names that he was put with in the same bracket was justified. He looked like he had that ceiling. It’s just that injuries have been against him. It’s unfortunate, but that’s what football is. Injuries change everything<br /><br /><a href="phil-jones.html">Phil Jones</a> was in the reserves and on his way to come with us. Sometimes he was training with us and I was like ‘nah, I don’t think so’. More time passed by and the more he trained with us it was like ‘wow, he’s changed so fast’. He went from being somebody you’re not sure about to being ‘wow, that’s some player’. I remember there was a game when two of the central defenders were injured and Sam <b>[<a href="sam-allardyce.html">Allardyce</a>]</b> asked if I was okay playing with Phil. I was like ‘sure, let him play’. From the first minute he smashed <b>[Didier]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, challenges and everything and had the fans behind him. He was unbelievable. I have never seen progression like that in the space of two years. He was a different player</p>
