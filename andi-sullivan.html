<blockquote>
  <p>[Rising USWNT star Andi Sullivan back on track after knee injury] Obviously it was great to be with the national team and everything, and I was like, ‘This is my dream and I’m doing it,’ and it was going well and I was so happy. One of the parents knew I was sad and they tried to ask me about the national team, and I just broke down crying. They asked, ‘How was it?’ And I was just like, ‘Oh crap, I’m not going to get to go back there for a long time - if ever.<br /><br />If that injury had happened to me earlier on, when I was in high school or even the beginning of college, I would have been a complete mess. But I do think it was a good time, and I do think it happened for some sort of reason. Getting to go with the full [national] team and then hurting myself, I knew that I could do it. I was like, ‘You’ve done it once, you can do it again<br /><br />[Sullivan sees the pathway to a World Cup goal] That’s been my dream, but I don’t want to get overwhelmed by it. I am a firm believer if I do the little things right every day - that means here, in training and the games - that angle will come. I’m not looking at it and getting overwhelmed, I’m just focusing on, ‘What am I doing right now to get better?’ And that will help prepare me for whatever is next</p>
