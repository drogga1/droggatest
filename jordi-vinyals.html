  <p><b>[Why <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> didn’t make the grade at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Even though he wasn’t that muscular at the time, Adama had the best physique of all the players in the second division. He was the fastest and the strongest player. His problem was he was not tactically at his current level. Many of his opponents knew exactly how, despite his physical superiority, they could tactically stop him. I am happy that the boy has developed so well in England<br /><br /><b>[Vinyals hopes <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> could return to play for his home club one day]</b> I’ve always liked Thiago. He has matured into an even more wonderful footballer in Germany because he has also adapted to the physically demanding level and is not only the one who distributes the ball, but also conquers it. It combines everything a modern midfielder needs. I would like to watch him and would be happy if he would play in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> again</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> youth coach Jordi Vinyals believes that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s time in charge of the Catalans was a turning point in the history of the club as he patiently nurtured the talents of the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>]</b> The pool of talent is even bigger today than it was some years ago. Because there are better projects to educate players with highly qualified staff and concepts, to keep improving the youth sector<br /><br /><a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> were of course fantastic talents. But they were lucky too, as they were not only given a few chances and that was it. They were calmly and constantly embedded into the first team. They were not starters right away<br /><br />They had coaches who trusted them. And then one day someone came in who understood perfectly what it took to integrate players from the academy (Guardiola). He had the courage to take uncomfortable decisions and sacrifice big names to give young players a leading role<br /><br />You can say that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was the turning point in the history of the club. That goes for the integration of La Masia and also the way that football was played and opponents were dominated. That made it easier for us youth coaches as well<br /><br /><b>[Vinyals, who worked as a youth-team coach at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> between 2012 and 2015, feels that the weight of expectation in the modern era has proven too much for some]</b> I constantly see 17, 18 or 19 year olds making big headlines and stuff like that. But not every player can cope with that, because they’re simply not mature enough. By doing that you imply to them that they already reached something in life. Plus expectations are raised. Someone who believes he has made it just because he is in the media can easily get on the wrong track<br /><br /><b>[Discussing Alen Halilovic, who joined <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> back in 2014 to significant fanfare but ultimately failed to make the grade and the club and left for <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> in 2018]</b> The boy is a perfect example of what I just said. He had so much pressure on him. But that was not only because his name was in the papers all the time. He also had the pressure from his entourage and the club. There were clauses that said he had to become a professional when he played a certain amount of youth matches. Do you think that is something that helps a young player? You can’t plan anything in football. He had great qualities, I don’t want to dispute that, but we shouldn’t forget that he played with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> B in the Segunda Division, a very competitive league.<br /><br />He should have been far better than his team-mates or opposing players to earn a place in the professional squad. He couldn’t be that because he came from Croatia as a teenager and he wasn’t given the time to get used to it, to work with patience to prove that one day he could play for the professionals. Under these circumstances, it was difficult for him, of course</p>
