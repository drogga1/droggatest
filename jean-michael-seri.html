  <p><b>[More creative than Lionel Messi - Meet Nice star Jean Michael Seri]</b> It’s a strange ranking because you’re reliant on others. I look to see where I am in Europe.<br /><br /><b>[He started out at the Cyril Domoraud Centre in 1999 aged only eight]</b> Training footballers in Africa is special. Up to a certain level, we play barefoot. As a result, we’re more in contact with the ball and we acquire a good technical basis for control. When we put on boots, it means that we’ve achieved a certain level.<br /><br />I was inspired by Marcelo Gallardo when he played with Monaco in the early 2000s. That’s my nickname in the Ivory Coast<br /><br />Xavi did it all the time for Barcelona and I tried to copy him. It’s a trick I’ve worked hard at and tried to master. I have ingrown toenails and when it’s cold I need special treatment. I don’t see myself playing in a country where it’s cold. I hurt everywhere and I struggle to train. I feel good here, and so does my family. I don’t see why I’d go elsewhere. The club is improving and there are many positives, so why go?</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona target Jean Michael Seri has claimed that he has not played his last game for Nice]</b> No, it wasn’t my last match with Nice. I’ll be at Amiens on Saturday. I don’t know too much <b>[about the rumours]</b>. I’ve told everyone to let me focus on my goal, which today was to focus on the Champions League and then, afterwards, to see if I’ll leave or stay. If it happens with Barcelona, that’s good, otherwise I am happy in Nice</p>

  <p><b>[Jean Michael Seri is over the disappointment of failing to secure a move to Barcelona]</b> I turned the page after August 31. When you do not go, you belong to a club and you have to give everything to them. Missing out on a transfer has not destabilised me. It was tough but victories like this are achieved because we are all strong mentally and have forgotten everything. We have started the season positively and we hope to enjoy a beautiful adventure in the days to come.</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele’s attitude has been questioned by Nice midfielder Jean Michael Seri after forcing through a €105 million move to Barcelona]</b> For a young player like Dembele, that’s not the attitude to adopt. When someone’s not well informed, they take decisions that are not correct. Then, after arriving at Barca, he got injured. Without the pressure he suffered and the tension, maybe he would not have got injured. In contrast, Kylian Mbappe kept away from what was going on before signing for PSG.<br /><br /><b>[Seri decided against emulating Dembele and pushing for a high-profile switch to Catalunya]</b> It was a difficult time. It will remain with me until the end of my career, but I have turned the page now. I prefer not to think about the past and focus on what I know best: playing football</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham have confirmed that they have won the race to sign Jean Michael Seri from Nice]</b> It was a long day yesterday so it was great to get the move finalised. Now, I’m ready to get started and looking forward to meeting the squad and getting to know them, the Head Coach and his staff better. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new adventure that starts for me and I’m hoping it will all go well.</p>

  <p><b>[Jean Michael Seri has told Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool that they did not do enough during the last transfer window to keep him away from Fulham]</b> When I played for Pacos de Ferreira in Portugal, Nice came for me and they really came. Fulham wanted me the same way. They said: ‘We want you, come to Fulham’. Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, they saw me but they didn’t say: ‘We want you.’ Because Fulham gave me this respect, although other clubs wanted me, I wanted to sign for Fulham. Fulham said to my president: ‘We want Mica Seri, talk to him if he’s interested because we know Chelsea, Manchester want him and he almost signed for Barcelona but we are back in the Premier League’. My president calls me, he says: ‘Fulham want you, do you want to go?’ I say: ‘If they want me, they respect me. The big clubs want me but Fulham show they want me’.</p>
