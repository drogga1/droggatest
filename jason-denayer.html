<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jason Denayer speaks about joining the JMG Academy in Belgium as a teenager]</b> The first time I went, I took my football shoes. Then I saw the sign at the gates - no shoes, nothing. I was like, ‘No shoes? Okay …’. It was very strange, and at the start it hurts, a lot! When you play, you break your toes, but my technique improved so much. So yes, it does work. It is a mental challenge being away from your family. It helped that I was used to always being on the streets with my friends, but I saw children crying when they left their parents. Football wise, it was excellent for me, it helped me understand the game in a different way. But also things like homework and just getting by, everything was my responsibility. That made me grow up a lot</p>
