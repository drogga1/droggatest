  <p><b>[Jason Denayer speaks about joining the JMG Academy in Belgium as a teenager]</b> The first time I went, I took my football shoes. Then I saw the sign at the gates - no shoes, nothing. I was like, ‘No shoes? Okay …’. It was very strange, and at the start it hurts, a lot! When you play, you break your toes, but my technique improved so much. So yes, it does work. It is a mental challenge being away from your family. It helped that I was used to always being on the streets with my friends, but I saw children crying when they left their parents. Football wise, it was excellent for me, it helped me understand the game in a different way. But also things like homework and just getting by, everything was my responsibility. That made me grow up a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Jason Denayer has accused Manchester City of forcing him into a loan move with La Liga newcomers Girona against his wishes and preventing him from leaving permanently to join Lyon]</b> Man City are not keen on selling me, or only against unreasonable terms for potential buyers: a buy-back clause for almost the same price as the selling price. That means that clubs aren’t keen on signing me permanently and prefer to take me on loan. I’ve nothing against a new loan deal, but I want to choose my destination. Lyon would be the perfect place for me. An ambitious club in an attractive league.<br /><br />The club and I had already reached a personal agreement, but City are vetoing a move and are pushing me to Girona … we’ll see what’ll happen in the coming weeks. If the situation is not resolved, I will go to Girona, but not heartily.<br /><br />I would rather not join Girona. Not because I want to make it difficult for myself, but because I like to play in a team that is dominating. Not only to show myself, but also to develop myself. I have always had certain priorities in my career choices. Now it’s first and foremost a club that plays at the top of the league. In addition, in a pleasant city and with good supporters, who create a lot of noise at home. The financial aspect comes in the last place. The problem of Girona is that the club has just been promoted to the Primera Division, and in a small city. That’s not really what I’m looking for</p>

  <p><b>[Jason Denayer has completed another loan move away from Manchester City and will spend the remainder of the season back at Galatasaray]</b> It will be the 22-year-old’s fourth successive season-long loan deal having previously spent campaigns with Celtic, Galatasaray and Sunderland. His first spell with the Super Lig club came during the 2015/16 season when he played 28 times and claimed an assist in the Turkish Cup final. A previous winner of the PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year, the central defender has so far won eight caps for Belgium and made 99 career appearances at club level.</p>

  <p><b>[Why Jason Denayer is as vital to Lyon as Fekir and Memphis]</b> There’s good visibility of the French game in the media. Playing in big matches is an advantage for me. I’m playing at a higher level than I was before.<br /><br /><b>[After his man-of-the-match display in shutting down Lionel Messi and Barcelona at Parc OL]</b> It was a team performance, everyone did their job well. It’s true I felt good in the game but the whole team did its job<br /><br />For me, everything’s gone well in recent months. I’m playing well and it’s allowed me to get back in the national team. I need stability and it’s clear that I’ll stay with Lyon next year. It’s my first season here and I’m not thinking about leaving. And I don’t think the club would let me!</p>
