  <p><b>[Former <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> defender Gael Givet has lifted the lid on one of the motivational techniques used by erstwhile manager <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> at the club]</b> We had warmed up and we went back to the dressing room. While we were putting on our shin guards, he said: ‘Guys, wait!’ He put down a projector and showed us a montage of the films ‘Gladiator’ and ‘300’. In short, warriors with swords. We were all in the dressing room going: ‘Ahhhh!’ <b>[he said mimicking a soldier with a sword]</b>. After 30 minutes, we were 3-0 down. We lost 7-1. After the match, we were all laughing. The warriors had completely passed us by<br /><br /><b>[Like Vikash Dhorasoo, who made a film about feeling like an outsider in the squad, Givet did not play a single minute]</b> I’d get up every morning and go to training, and I almost wondered what I was doing there. There were only stars in the squad: <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> <b>[…]</b> I’m very shy. It was hard for me. But it was exceptional, a great experience. For two months, I didn’t open my mouth much. If I was there, though, it’s because I played some good seasons, and played in the qualifying. But I found myself with <a href="lilian-thuram.html">Lilian Thuram</a>, my idol, and training with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> every day. It was weird.<br /><br /><b>[Givet was not necessarily keen on being called in the one moment he might have been required]</b> Against Spain in the quarter-finals, I think <a href="william-gallas.html">William Gallas</a> had a problem. Coach <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Raymond Domenech</a> shouted on me: ‘Go Gael! Go get warm’. In my head, it was weird. It was 2-1. My heart was beginning to get faster. Then you say to yourself: ‘F***!’ You don’t know if you want to go on or not. It’s a strange feeling. You train and play to experience matches like that, and at the moment, the feeling that comes to you is apprehension. But I didn’t get on and we won 3-1</p>
