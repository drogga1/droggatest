  <p><b>[Alf-Inge Haaland was quizzed on the United speculation and supposed interest from other English clubs after seeing his son Haaland net a treble against Genk]</b> It would be nice <b>[if United and others showed interest]</b>. It is important to distinguish between being a supporter and a job. So, I have a very relaxed relationship. It’s a little different when it’s serious. I think most players dream of being in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at one time or another. It’s the league that gets the most attention and has very good teams. There is no doubt <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is attractive to him. But we must wait and see if he gets a chance<br /><br />He is a good player who plays for a very good team. It’s a club that trusts young <b>[players]</b> and has given him the chance. They have thought for a long time that they would give him the chance this summer, and at the same time there are many things that have taken place. Most of the job he has done himself, but he has been assisted by his former team-mates and current coaches and team-mates, in addition to the hard work he has put in over many years</p>

  <p><b>[Salzburg phenomenon <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> is currently on a diet used by <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as he attempts to emulate the career of the Portuguese icon]</b> I had to be determined to make it in the game. But Erling made all the sacrifices, leaving home at 16 to move to Molde, and he is a lot more professional than I was. He was told a story by <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a> about a lunch he had with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> had fish, nothing else. Erling now tries to do the same things because <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is 34 and still at the top of the game, so it shows the value of doing the right things</p>

  <p><b>[father Alf-Inge says Man Utd-linked <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> interested in future <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> move]</b> He was a <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> fan and a <b>[Manchester]</b> City fan and a Nottingham Forest fan. He followed me but that’s what you do in your youth. There’s a difference between being a supporter and having it as a job. I think at one stage he would like to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. When that’s going to happen, I don’t know. It’s a very tough league. Up to now he’s ahead of the stage we thought he would be at. He’s built for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at one stage, I think. Whether that happens now or at a later stage, we don’t know<br /><br /><b>[Recent reports have suggested Salzburg could ask for up to €100 million for the impressive centre-forward. Alf-Inge doubts the Austrian club would demand such an exorbitant fee]</b> There are always stories. He’s at Salzburg and he’s at a fantastic club and playing in the Champions League, so in a way, there’s no hurry. But Salzburg have shown in the past they’re sort of a middle-step club and if they’re going to recruit players in the future they can’t put a stupid price tag on the players, otherwise nobody would like to go there</p>

  <p><b>[Former Leeds and Manchester City star Alf Inge Haaland talk about the path being taken by his prolific son]</b> I am very happy for him and Borussia Dortmund, although for me the most important thing is to keep growing as before. He was always a top scorer, but he also gives many assists. Obviously, I am proud.<br /><br /><a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> told us that they needed someone like him and that the goal is as high as possible. He is at a team that fights for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and is growing in European competitions. It is perfect to continue training.

  <p><b>[Man Utd missed out on <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> because club did not want him enough]</b> You never know how it would go in other clubs. It may well have been good, too. We’ll never get an answer to that. But we are very happy with the clubs he has been in. You have to go to a club where the whole club wants you, not just the coach. I think that’s the most important thing, in addition to how the club has been over the last five or 10 years and what direction they’ve taken</p>

  <p><b>[It was Keane who disclosed what he had said; <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> had actually remained tight-lipped on that particular aspect of the incident]</b> It’s funny: since 1997, he’s never once looked me in the eye. There are always hard fouls in a game like this, but that was well over the top. I won’t tell you what he said to me. Let’s just say it wasn’t very nice. I’m only glad my leg was off the ground; otherwise he would have done me a lot of damage. I must upgrade my insurance the next time we play <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Haaland was ultimately forced to retire due to injury in 2003 and when later asked about the last impacting of Keane’s challenge]</b> The knee still hurts, that isn’t going to go away. I have to accept that. Did that tackle end my career? Well, I never played a full game again, did I? It seems like a great coincidence, don’t you think?<br /><br /><b>[Despite talk of a court case, <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> never took legal action]</b> I don’t blame him for kicking me in other games or that particular game. What I was concerned and worried about is that he said, in his first book, that he wanted to take revenge. And I don’t think that’s part and parcel of football<br /><br />I don’t blame him. I never actually said he finished my career. It was my last full game in England, so maybe he had something to do with it</p>
