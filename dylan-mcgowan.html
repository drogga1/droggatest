  <p>[Adelaide United defender Dylan McGowan immediately switched his focus to his side’s trip to Gamba Osaka] We go into every game to win it, whether it’s home or away, and now we give ourselves a chance to go to Gamba and if we win it we [stay] second in the group and it gives us a very good chance to qualify.<br /><br />It was a very difficult game. Jeju are a very good team, especially here in Korea, and Australian teams have been struggling in the Champions League. So it’s good for us to get three points and good for our fans because we are struggling in the A-League but we did really well and hopefully it gives us a chance to progress to the next stage</p>

  <p>[Pacos de Ferreira have confirmed the signing of ex-Adelaide United defender Dylan McGowan for the next two Primeira Liga seasons] It was done and dusted in January really, they saw something that they liked in me and once that interest was there it was a straight forward decision to make it happen.<br /><br />It’s a high quality league and I’ll be playing against some huge clubs. On the weekend I went to watch them against Porto and there’s obviously Benfica and Sporting Lisbon, too - Champions League and Europa League clubs, so that’ll be exciting for me to play against that quality of opposition</p>

  <p>[Dylan McGowan is back in town and this time he’s with the Socceroos in a set up that’s impressed him hugely] It’s a good camp to get called into. It’s a long camp, which is good. Often with the national team it’s four or five days, in and out, a couple of games and not too many training sessions. But with this camp being an extended period, I get ample time to train with the boys and get used to the set-up. It’s the top level of Australian football and you can tell that as soon as you set foot in the camp. The staff, the preparation that goes into training - it’s completely next level to anything I’ve been part of. I’m really enjoying having a prolonged period of time in this environment and hopefully that holds me in good stead for the future.<br /><br />I’m preparing physically and mentally to be there if I’m needed. But I’m just here to play my role in the squad and pick up as much information and knowledge and pick the older boys’ brains as best I can and become a better player. Whether that means I play on Thursday or I don’t play at all in this whole camp, I’m just here trying to make myself a bit better and enjoying the experience.<br /><br />The boss [Postecoglou] came out at his press conference and said he thinks [joining Pacos is] a good move. If I can get there and start playing then who knows what can happen. Being called into this [camp] and moving [to Portugal] has meant it’s been a really exciting couple of months for me. This is just the cherry on the cake really</p>

  <p>[Socceroos Ajdin Hrustic and Dylan McGowan were on cloud nine after making their international debuts in Australia’s 4-0 loss to Brazil] Not a result we wanted but on a personal level to debut is the pinnacle of your career. I’m over the moon. It’s just a shame about the result. Looking back it’s just a lot of hard work to get here [to debut] and I’ll enjoy tonight. You always learn a bit more when you lose - especially against a top team like Brazil - defensively and going forward. We tried to play our football against the world’s best nation at the moment. It’s a great month to be here [in the national team]. I’m enjoying training and learning a lot.</p>

  <p>[Socceroos new-boy Dylan McGowan is still pinching himself as Australia settles in Russia ahead of their Confederations Cup campaign] It’s still sinking in really. It’s probably the biggest point in my career so far. It’s now a case of building on it and if the boss needs me throughout this tournament, just being ready and prepared to help the boys. You saw how good the Brazilians were - they’re a great side and number one [in the world] for a reason. Training with the boys these last few weeks, getting to know them all and working at the intensity we do here has really helped me prepare.<br /><br />I said when I came in this is the best set-up I’ve ever seen in terms of the staff and the preparation that goes into everything. Once you get a taste for it, you definitely want a little bit more. I’m fortunate to be in this camp and have such a long time [here] and be at such a great tournament like the Confederations Cup. I’m hungry for more and hopefully there’s more to come<br /><br />It’s a massive tournament - we knew that coming here and we really want to do well. Germany is just the first stop on this tour and hopefully we can get three points. The boss will set us up how we always do, how we always prepare against any opposition and that’s to go out and play our football and take the game to them</p>
