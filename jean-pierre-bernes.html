<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir’s former agent has revealed that late demands from the player’s entourage contributed to his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move falling through in the summer of 2018. Jean-Pierre Bernes says that isn’t the full story]</b> Nabil was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s priority. I worked for four months with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> representatives, with (Liverpool manager) <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, <a href="jean-michel-aulas.html">Jean-Michel Aulas</a>, everything was ready. Nabil was already aware of his future contract, which would have seen him earn around €45m over five years. And on the day that the contract was supposed to be signed, at Rambouillet, we saw a lawyer and Nabil’s brother-in-law arrive who said: ‘Stop everything, discussions have to start all over again’. It was surreal. We thought that we were in a Walt Disney film<br /><br /><b>[Bernes did admit that Fekir’s history of knee injuries were a factor in the deal falling through]</b> There were two elements. The player’s medical was negative and the second element was that when you want to sign for a big club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, you need a certain attitude. When the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> guys witnessed this cinema, they immediately … Sometimes when a player has an injury, representatives can make an effort to make it work<br /><br /><b>[Bernes went on to explain that Fekir, who moved to <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> this summer for a £22m, was not aware of what was happening as the transfer fell through]</b> The brother-in-law of Nabil Fekir all of a sudden acted like a player’s agent. He wanted a commission, everyone knows, it is fashionable these days. <b>[Fekir]</b> was on a cloud, he seemed to have transformed, he didn’t even greet the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> representatives. He arrived after the medical, everyone was looking at each other, the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> representatives were wondering where they were. I was ashamed.</p>
