  <p><b>[Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League]</b> I have my doubts and frankly, I don’t see any merger happening at least this year. Also, I don’t see any reason for a conflict and I cannot understand why it is constantly being touted as ‘I-League merging with ISL’? Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League? The name is not important. I-League is I-League, you have to have a national league and we have one.<br /><br />Many new clubs are coming in also. The clubs which have pulled out were not investing in football. They blame other reasons but the real reason is that they don’t have bandwidth now to continue<br /><br /><b>[The U-17 World Cup will be hosted by India]</b> Whatever they <b>[U-17 team]</b> want to do, the AIFF will support. We have given them a free hand. The U-17 is one team where we haven’t held back anything. We are not interfering at all. I only hope they make us proud. The country’s performance should be recognised</p>

  <p><b>[On replacement to the departed U-17 national team coach Nicolai Adam]</b> We are going to look at the best options available. We have received a good number of applications for the job and we would soon begin the process of interviews.<br /><br />On behalf of the AIFF, I can say that we took the decision in the interest of the players. We’ll obviously get a replacement and the new coach will take charge soon. We will have an interim coach to handle the team, but the replacement will take over the team by the end of February<br /><br />The support staff should have informed the AIFF about the behaviour of the coach. There was absolutely no indication from the support staff or the players. We would have acted at the first complaint. I reprimanded them for allowing things to reach this stage<br /><br />The team will resume training soon and will continue to get the best facilities</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav will be involved with the U17 national team]</b> It’s not that we wished this to happen. We want to have the best coach in place. I have spoken to Baichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav that they will have to be more involved in the next few months to integrate the team with the new coach. There will be no problem in the preparation of the team. The U17 campaign will be on track as early as possible with the best possible man-in-charge.<br /><br />There were some interpersonal relationships which went sour between the young players and the coach. The player and the coach must have a comfort level otherwise none of the parties will be able to deliver. We tried to see reason.We felt that it was not going to work.Time is also short. We couldn’t let a situation like this continue. Now we will have a new coach in his place by the end of this month<br /><br /><b>[On Nicolai Adam]</b> If we receive a complaint, then what are we supposed to do? Let us not go too much into the technicalities. The fact is there was friction between the players and the coach. We took immediate action</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel, the All India Football Federation president, stated that India will play its part in ensuring that football in Asia becomes a dominant force in the next 10 years or so]</b> As India prepares to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in October with a great deal of emphasis on legacy initiatives, we will look to further engage with friendly countries such as Qatar and strive to make football in Asia a dominant force on the world stage in the next decade.<br /><br />I have noted with great satisfaction that the SC has welcomed the recent positive report by its third party auditor on the matter of further improving working and living conditions of construction workers, many of whom are Indians, involved in building 2022 World Cup stadiums<br /><br />As AFC Senior Vice-President and AIFF President, I fully support the Qatar Football Association and Supreme Committee in their efforts to make the tournament a huge success. I am pleased that Qatar will be hosting Asia’s second ever World Cup in 2022 days in November 2022</p>

  <p><b>[President Praful Patel expressed high hopes for Indian football, targeting World Cup qualification by 2022]</b> These are times of revolution. India breaking into 100 may sound easy but it itsn’t. A lot of effort has gone in from every player and the coach. I think the next big thing is to break into top 50. That is our next goal. By 2022, <b>[India]</b> atleast hope to qualify for World Cup.<br /><br />These under 17 boys will be the backbone of the Indian team. We saw them beat Syria. We beat an Italian team <b>[but there was so much]</b> negativity. It was about applauding the young children and making India proud. Instead, we go into negativity<br /><br />Women have an important role to play. Everyone enjoys cricket as one of the most popular games. The day when football is followed by <b>[an]</b> enire family, it will be a success. I must tell you, if you put heart and soul <b>[into it]</b>, women’s team can make <b>[the country proud]</b> like the men’s team</p>

We hope that they get the encouragement and support of the fans. We discussed this with the government and we jointly are going to ensure that maximum number of schools and colleges participate in viewing the games. I am sure wherever India are playing , there will be a lot of following and support for India. Patel also praised the spirit in the camp. The players are happy, they are very excited. We don’t interfere in team selection and how they prepare. We can tell you that the mindset of players is happy and positive and that is equally important. They are happy, enthusiastic and confident.</p>

This is a once-in-a-lifetime chace and we hope that people can come in large numbers to the display locations in the host cities.</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel says overseas scouting project was an eye-opener for AIFF]</b> We are happy to continue this programme. I would say it was an eye opener. I’m happy that we did embark on this and we found two young lads to play for us. In due course, we will continue this. I agree with you, we will not restrict scouting to this age group <b>[Under-17]</b>. We will try to expand.<br /><br />Please try and understand that a person has to have a nationality of India because that is as per the regulation. Some people have this wrong notion that a PIO <b>[Player of Indian origin]</b> who has a passport of a different nation can also play for the Indian national team. The answer is you can’t. In India the laws of granting nationality are not so simple. We have a laid process. So it is not just about my desire and it’s not just about football but it’s the law of the land. We have to honour those processes also<br /><br />But yes if there are candidates of Indian origin complying with all our regulations, we will be more than happy to encourage them. There is no reason to not include them. We will continue to scout</p>

  <p><b>[The Indian national teams are doing better than ever]</b> Just put in your best and make the country proud. Just play to win and do not feel the pressure of anybody. You will have a great future in spite of whatever will happen. So I think the team is mentally quite well conditioned. I don’t think at this stage anything that the coach or anyone would feel that anything that they wanted was not done.<br /><br />Let’s expect the best. I think too much pressure on the young kids is not desirable. I think the kids are more excited about their future beyond the World Cup. It shows that they are very motivated<br /><br />It’s not about restriction. We, as a nation, want to build a strong national team. This is our endeavour. If we are trying to put them on a contract, they will be rewarded reasonably well. Indian national team has do well and assuming we win the rights to host the Under-20 World Cup. So again you cannot be rebuilding the team<br /><br />We are on the right track and going in the right direction. We are trying to balance between the interest of the national team and the youngster’s future. It will be good for Indian football and equally good for the players<br /><br />The Under-16 team is there and we will continue to build a team for the next edition of the Under-17 World Cup. With respect to the national teams, we are doing much better than ever in the past but if you see the long term horizon, this is the only way to go. We are investing in the Under-17 team and now the Under-16 team is doing quite well. We drew with Iraq and the overall performance is reasonably good. I still won’t call it good but we are in the right direction<br /><br />I feel that over a period of time, we will have two distinct youth development teams. This team which shall include some boys from Under-19 and another team which is going to be Under-17</p>

We are setting up a national training centre of excellence which will be the home of the Indian national team, junior and women’s team. We are wanting to build a world class centre of excellence.<br /><br />We should have a permanent facility for everything - from physical training to swimming room to classrooms to mental conditioning. We are in talks and I don’t want to go beyond that at this point. It may cost us over 100 crores INR. Hopefully we will get FIFA supporting us in this initiative as much as we will reach out to private sponsors. It would have at least a couple of fields so that there is enough space. We want to host it in a place where there is more competitive sport available because you can’t be putting it in the backwaters. You won’t get teams to play competitive games<br /><br />A lot of talks are at an advanced stage and it is not yet finalized. As soon as the World Cup is over, we will announce the location. We hope to commence the work as early as 2018 so that it is ready in an year and a half</p>
