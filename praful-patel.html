  <p><b>[Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League]</b> I have my doubts and frankly, I don’t see any merger happening at least this year. Also, I don’t see any reason for a conflict and I cannot understand why it is constantly being touted as ‘I-League merging with ISL’? Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League? The name is not important. I-League is I-League, you have to have a national league and we have one.<br /><br />Many new clubs are coming in also. The clubs which have pulled out were not investing in football. They blame other reasons but the real reason is that they don’t have bandwidth now to continue<br /><br /><b>[The U-17 World Cup will be hosted by India]</b> Whatever they <b>[U-17 team]</b> want to do, the AIFF will support. We have given them a free hand. The U-17 is one team where we haven’t held back anything. We are not interfering at all. I only hope they make us proud. The country’s performance should be recognised</p>

  <p><b>[On replacement to the departed U-17 national team coach Nicolai Adam]</b> We are going to look at the best options available. We have received a good number of applications for the job and we would soon begin the process of interviews.<br /><br />On behalf of the AIFF, I can say that we took the decision in the interest of the players. We’ll obviously get a replacement and the new coach will take charge soon. We will have an interim coach to handle the team, but the replacement will take over the team by the end of February<br /><br />The support staff should have informed the AIFF about the behaviour of the coach. There was absolutely no indication from the support staff or the players. We would have acted at the first complaint. I reprimanded them for allowing things to reach this stage<br /><br />The team will resume training soon and will continue to get the best facilities</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel stated that Kheleo will be part of every major component of the first ever FIFA tournament to be held in India]</b> Presenting Kheleo as the Official Mascot to the world is another big step for our event. As the face of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, he will be going across the country to promote the tournament and to inspire kids and adults alike.</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav will be involved with the U17 national team]</b> It’s not that we wished this to happen. We want to have the best coach in place. I have spoken to Baichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav that they will have to be more involved in the next few months to integrate the team with the new coach. There will be no problem in the preparation of the team. The U17 campaign will be on track as early as possible with the best possible man-in-charge.<br /><br />There were some interpersonal relationships which went sour between the young players and the coach. The player and the coach must have a comfort level otherwise none of the parties will be able to deliver. We tried to see reason.We felt that it was not going to work.Time is also short. We couldn’t let a situation like this continue. Now we will have a new coach in his place by the end of this month<br /><br /><b>[On Nicolai Adam]</b> If we receive a complaint, then what are we supposed to do? Let us not go too much into the technicalities. The fact is there was friction between the players and the coach. We took immediate action</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel, the All India Football Federation president, stated that India will play its part in ensuring that football in Asia becomes a dominant force in the next 10 years or so]</b> As India prepares to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in October with a great deal of emphasis on legacy initiatives, we will look to further engage with friendly countries such as Qatar and strive to make football in Asia a dominant force on the world stage in the next decade.<br /><br />I have noted with great satisfaction that the SC has welcomed the recent positive report by its third party auditor on the matter of further improving working and living conditions of construction workers, many of whom are Indians, involved in building 2022 World Cup stadiums<br /><br />As AFC Senior Vice-President and AIFF President, I fully support the Qatar Football Association and Supreme Committee in their efforts to make the tournament a huge success. I am pleased that Qatar will be hosting Asia’s second ever World Cup in 2022 days in November 2022</p>

  <p><b>[President Praful Patel expressed high hopes for Indian football, targeting World Cup qualification by 2022]</b> These are times of revolution. India breaking into 100 may sound easy but it itsn’t. A lot of effort has gone in from every player and the coach. I think the next big thing is to break into top 50. That is our next goal. By 2022, <b>[India]</b> atleast hope to qualify for World Cup.<br /><br />These under 17 boys will be the backbone of the Indian team. We saw them beat Syria. We beat an Italian team <b>[but there was so much]</b> negativity. It was about applauding the young children and making India proud. Instead, we go into negativity<br /><br />Women have an important role to play. Everyone enjoys cricket as one of the most popular games. The day when football is followed by <b>[an]</b> enire family, it will be a success. I must tell you, if you put heart and soul <b>[into it]</b>, women’s team can make <b>[the country proud]</b> like the men’s team</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel also spoke to the press at the event and had a few words to share regarding the attendance during India’s games]</b> We will ensure that all the games in which India play have very good audience. We hope that they get the encouragement and support of the fans. We discussed this with the government and we jointly are going to ensure that maximum number of schools and colleges participate in viewing the games. I am sure wherever India are playing , there will be a lot of following and support for India. Patel also praised the spirit in the camp. The players are happy, they are very excited. We don’t interfere in team selection and how they prepare. We can tell you that the mindset of players is happy and positive and that is equally important. They are happy, enthusiastic and confident.</p>

  <p><b>[Fans’ opportunity to feast their eyes on the trophy]</b> The trophy experience will mark the last phase of our event promotion and it is very important because it will give the fans around the country the opportunity to get up close to the same official winner’s trophy that the captain of the winning team will be lifting on 28 October in Kolkata. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chace and we hope that people can come in large numbers to the display locations in the host cities.</p>
