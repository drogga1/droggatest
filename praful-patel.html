  <p><b>[Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League]</b> I have my doubts and frankly, I don’t see any merger happening at least this year. Also, I don’t see any reason for a conflict and I cannot understand why it is constantly being touted as ‘I-League merging with ISL’? Why can we not say that the ISL might merge with the I-League? The name is not important. I-League is I-League, you have to have a national league and we have one.<br /><br />Many new clubs are coming in also. The clubs which have pulled out were not investing in football. They blame other reasons but the real reason is that they don’t have bandwidth now to continue<br /><br /><b>[The U-17 World Cup will be hosted by India]</b> Whatever they <b>[U-17 team]</b> want to do, the AIFF will support. We have given them a free hand. The U-17 is one team where we haven’t held back anything. We are not interfering at all. I only hope they make us proud. The country’s performance should be recognised</p>

  <p><b>[On replacement to the departed U-17 national team coach Nicolai Adam]</b> We are going to look at the best options available. We have received a good number of applications for the job and we would soon begin the process of interviews.<br /><br />On behalf of the AIFF, I can say that we took the decision in the interest of the players. We’ll obviously get a replacement and the new coach will take charge soon. We will have an interim coach to handle the team, but the replacement will take over the team by the end of February<br /><br />The support staff should have informed the AIFF about the behaviour of the coach. There was absolutely no indication from the support staff or the players. We would have acted at the first complaint. I reprimanded them for allowing things to reach this stage<br /><br />The team will resume training soon and will continue to get the best facilities</p>

  <p><b>[Praful Patel stated that Kheleo will be part of every major component of the first ever FIFA tournament to be held in India]</b> Presenting Kheleo as the Official Mascot to the world is another big step for our event. As the face of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, he will be going across the country to promote the tournament and to inspire kids and adults alike.</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav will be involved with the U17 national team]</b> It’s not that we wished this to happen. We want to have the best coach in place. I have spoken to Baichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav that they will have to be more involved in the next few months to integrate the team with the new coach. There will be no problem in the preparation of the team. The U17 campaign will be on track as early as possible with the best possible man-in-charge.<br /><br />There were some interpersonal relationships which went sour between the young players and the coach. The player and the coach must have a comfort level otherwise none of the parties will be able to deliver. We tried to see reason.We felt that it was not going to work.Time is also short. We couldn’t let a situation like this continue. Now we will have a new coach in his place by the end of this month<br /><br /><b>[On Nicolai Adam]</b> If we receive a complaint, then what are we supposed to do? Let us not go too much into the technicalities. The fact is there was friction between the players and the coach. We took immediate action</p>
