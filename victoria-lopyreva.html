  <p>[World Cup 2018 ambassador and model Victoria Lopyreva has given her verdict on who the best player in the world] If you are talking about my favourite player in the world, I think it’s Lionel Messi. Of course, it’s always a competition - Messi or Ronaldo. I have my own opinion about it and I respect both of them. And I like Neymar so much because he has amazing personality. He’s a really great guy. But if you are talking about skills, if you are talking about what a genius he is, then I think it’s Messi. If you are asking about my favourite player of Manchester United, then it is Pogba.<br /><br />Pogba’s very impressive with his style and I think I would include him in my top three. Neymar, he knows how to dress. He’s a very stylish person, I like the way he is. He has his own personality. Cristiano [Ronaldo], I think is too simple. Maybe someone from Italian football. Graziano Pelle is very handsome. We celebrated New Year together this year, together with his beautiful girlfriend, also named Viktoria, Viky. During Euro 2016, on my twitter, I created an award called ‘Simpa of the Day’. ‘Simpa’ like the Italian word ‘simpatico’ - the most handsome of the day. Every day I would choose one player who was awarded by me the ‘Simpa of the Day’. And Graziano always won every day he played<br /><br />The Russian media teased me about it. He was the ‘Simpa of the Euros’. He’s very handsome. He will win this award at the World Cup also, even though he [and Italy] won’t play<br /><br />[Lopyreva is optimistic that Russia can spring a surprise] I like surprises. I realise that even if they get out of the group, it is already something that will make Russian people very happy. But they are trying their best and I believe that the team-building and the energy from presenting their country in their own country will give them more strength. Obviously, it’s very complicated to be in a competition with teams such as Germany or Argentina or Brazil because our national team doesn’t have even one player playing abroad. If you take Egypt, they have [Mohamed] Salah. We don’t have these international stars, but in football you never know. If you remember the Euros and Iceland, who would have expected them to achieve such results? Football is unpredictable and that’s why I like it so much</p>

  <p>[Victoria Lopyreva expects Pogba to stay at Manchester United as she promises ‘best World Cup ever’] Mourinho is a winner, he is used to winning. Pogba is a super-cool player and sometimes when there are two people who both have great personality, there can be a kind of tension between them. But it’s not such a conflict that Pogba would leave. And I really wish, as a Manchester United supporter, that Pogba will stay because, honestly, I cannot imagine the team without him<br /><br />I’m a UNAIDS ambassador for the World Cup and I’m running a zero discrimination programme. I asked a few football players to support me. Pogba’s a very nice guy and I say thanks to him for supporting me, along with Neymar, Brazil national team coach Tite and Francesco Totti. Leo Messi has promised to support me also. It’s a great message and we need to spread this message as much as we can<br /><br />First of all, I share your thoughts [about the concerns] and I am super-happy that this is the first World Cup supported by UNAIDS programmes for zero discrimination. This means that the main FIFA message for this World Cup is: everyone is welcome. Of course, everywhere you can find good and bad people. And if someone really wants to do something bad, they will probably try to do that. But security is so high that it will be not so easy. And I think that the concentration of positive emotions in this World Cup is going to be on a very high level. People will go to Russia not to fight with each other but to celebrate. Football is something that really unites people. I believe that football is out of politics and it doesn’t matter what nationality you are, what your social background is, what colour skin you have, all other football fans are your friends. Football is a universal language. I’m very excited, like all other Russians. It’s going to be the best World Cup ever and it is going to be the safest World Cup ever</p>

  <p>[Why fears over World Cup hooliganism and racism are overblown] People are not coming here to fight. Football is something that really unites people, and people are going to come here to celebrate, to have fun, to enjoy themselves and watch the beautiful game, because all of the top players are taking part at the World Cup. This will be the safest World Cup ever.</p>
