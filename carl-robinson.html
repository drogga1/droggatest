  <p><b>[Why British coaches may be shying away from MLS jobs]</b> It’s not easy understanding the rules. The rules are very difficult with the cans and the can’ts, the systems, the salary caps, the number of players that you’re allowed or not allowed, the trade system. So it’s not easy. But I don’t think that’s the main reason why managers don’t come over. Some managers like to stay in their comfort zones in the U.K. and, whether it’s right or wrong, some managers are different and want to try something different. I’ve been over now for eight years and I love it over here, but I look at it as part of my education. It’s an education outside of my comfort zone in the U.K. I know what the U.K. is about and I’ve got to learn something different, which is always nice.<br /><br /><b>[Being a player here first helped]</b>, without a doubt. Understanding the rules was part of that. When I was a player I was always trying, asking questions, learning. Hans Backe was a massive influence in me taking this job, as well as stepping up from being a player to a player-coach to an assistant coach to a head coach. I still speak to Hans now, so it was vital in my education of me going through that process of that development</p>

  <p><b>[On Felipe Martins]</b> Felipe has consistently proven to be one of the best box-to-box midfielders in Major League Soccer. He’s fiercely competitive, very comfortable on the ball, and creative going forward. We firmly believe he’s someone that will make the players around him better and we’re delighted to add him to our group in the prime of his career.</p>

  <p><b>[The Vancouver Whitecaps have announced the signing of midfielder Efrain Juarez from Mexican side Monterrey]</b> We are very excited to add Efraín to our group. He’s an extremely talented player who has experience at the highest level, can play multiple positions, and fits the character type we want at our club. Efraín’s preferred position is in the middle of the park and that’s where I expect him to play the majority of minutes for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Carl Robinson on his Vancouver Whitecaps side’s rivalry with FC Dallas]</b> It’s players wanting to win, managers wanting to win, and with that comes a competitive edge. I’d prefer that than just be matey - matey and friends all the time - and on the field the players pick each other up when they have physical contact. I watch the hockey and it’s brilliant, and maybe I can turn my team into that a little bit - without the fighting</p>

  <p><b>[Carl Robinson expressed pride in his players efforts versus Mexican club Tigres UANL, despite losing the first leg of their <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League semi-final tie 2-0 in Mexico]</b> I asked them to not leave anything on the pitch and leave no regrets and they certainly done that. <b>[Tigres]</b> were the better team on the night. The game panned out as I thought it would in relation to the type of game it was. We knew they’d have lots of possession and try and put us under pressure in certain ways. It was disappointing that the goals came from two little details that we didn’t get right. We’ve got a second leg, and we’re still very much in the tie, if we can get that first goal</p>

  <p><b>[DC United has acquired goalkeeper David Ousted from the Vancouver Whitecaps in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2018 MLS draft]</b> We are thankful to David for his five seasons in Vancouver. We’re happy that we were able to help David move into a situation that was attractive for him and his family, and we wish him the best at D.C. United.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United vs. Vancouver Whitecaps]</b> We know that there’s areas in Vancouver’s game where we believe they’re weak, so we’ll try and take advantage of them. I’m sure it’ll be a barnstormer. We know that.</p>

  <p><b>[The Vancouver Whitecaps have added Crystal Palace midfielder Jordon Mutch]</b> Jordon is a top midfielder who has played at the highest level. He’s played against the Chelseas, Arsenals, and Manchester Uniteds and now he wants to prove himself again in a new environment. He likes to get forward, he’s full of energy, and he’s in the prime of his career. We’re delighted to have him here.</p>
