  <p><b>[Carl Robinson on his Vancouver Whitecaps side’s rivalry with FC Dallas]</b> It’s players wanting to win, managers wanting to win, and with that comes a competitive edge. I’d prefer that than just be matey - matey and friends all the time - and on the field the players pick each other up when they have physical contact. I watch the hockey and it’s brilliant, and maybe I can turn my team into that a little bit - without the fighting</p>

  <p><b>[Why British coaches may be shying away from MLS jobs]</b> It’s not easy understanding the rules. The rules are very difficult with the cans and the can’ts, the systems, the salary caps, the number of players that you’re allowed or not allowed, the trade system. So it’s not easy. But I don’t think that’s the main reason why managers don’t come over. Some managers like to stay in their comfort zones in the U.K. and, whether it’s right or wrong, some managers are different and want to try something different. I’ve been over now for eight years and I love it over here, but I look at it as part of my education. It’s an education outside of my comfort zone in the U.K. I know what the U.K. is about and I’ve got to learn something different, which is always nice.<br /><br /><b>[Being a player here first helped]</b>, without a doubt. Understanding the rules was part of that. When I was a player I was always trying, asking questions, learning. Hans Backe was a massive influence in me taking this job, as well as stepping up from being a player to a player-coach to an assistant coach to a head coach. I still speak to Hans now, so it was vital in my education of me going through that process of that development</p>

  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps sought to address their defensive depth in Friday’s MLS SuperDraft]</b> Everyone will tell you that they got exactly who they wanted, but I’m not sure that’s 100 percent true. In that position of seven, we knew that we wanted someone and he was the guy that we actually wanted. He wasn’t talked about much prior to the draft and prior to the combine, and we gladly picked him up because the reviews afterwards were that he was going to get taken very, very soon after us… His performances in the combine showed that we think he’s ready. It was the right pick up for us.<br /><br />We know we’ve got a couple of holes to fill. We know we’ve got some work to do at the top of the pitch with key players and that’s why we didn’t draft too many attacking players because we know we’re going for a more experienced player in the nine and 10 area<br /><br />Well I wish I could say that there’s going to be 10 announcements tomorrow, but that’s probably not going to happen. We’re looking at the forward areas. The nine and the 10 are the two key areas that we need to try and address. After numerous conversations, and numerous names mentioned to us, we think we’re close and then suddenly the parameters change and things like that. On a daily basis we’re looking at names. We know they’re the two areas we need to strengthen and hopefully, sooner or later, it will be addressed</p>

  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps have announced the acquisition of attacking midfielder/forward Yordy Reyna from Austrian club FC Red Bull Salzburg]</b> Reyna is an exciting, hard-working young talent, and we are thrilled to add him to our club. He’s very direct with the ball, he can make the final pass, and he can score goals. He has all the attributes we want.</p>

  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps sign former Seattle Sounders star Fredy Montero on loan]</b> It’s a great signing for us and we’re delighted to welcome Fredy to our. We have worked diligently throughout the offseason to strengthen the forward areas and today we have managed to add a very good striker in Fredy. He has proven throughout his career to be an elite attacking player and consistent goal-scorer, and he is already familiar with the league and environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps use rivals’ success as motivation after disappointing campaign]</b> Seattle are a fantastic club - they’re our neighbors, they’re our rivals, we know that. They had Fredy Montero a couple of years ago and he’d done great for them - to be their all-time leading scorer is a fantastic achievement - and they then decided to sell him and moved on and he went and played for two other clubs before he wanted to return to Major League Soccer. I think the Seattle fans will respect what he’d done for them and appreciate what he’d done for them. He’s at the next chapter of his life now.<br /><br />If I told you it was ideal I’d be lying, it’s not ideal. We’re trying to fast-track <b>[the players’]</b> fitness. We’re probably playing players in <b>[preseason]</b> games longer than I would like based upon the start of the MLS season, so you set out for one or two things without the key detail that you want to put in. You can take it as an advantage or a disadvantage, we’re taking it as a positive</p>

  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps announced midfielder-forward Yordy Reyna has undergone surgery for a fifth metatarsal fracture of his left foot]</b> Yordy was only with the group for a few weeks before his unfortunate injury but quickly showed his attacking quality and dynamic play. We’re happy to hear the surgery went well and anticipate he will be back to full training at the start of summer.</p>

  <p><b>[Whitecaps hold edge after Red Bulls squander CCL first-leg opportunity]</b> We’re focused on Thursday’s game. Thursday’s game is a massive game for both clubs. Not just obviously Vancouver but also for New York, and it’s great that one team will go through and represent Major League Soccer. Hopefully it’s us, and Jesse will say hopefully it’s them. We’re talking about growing the league, and everything within Major League Soccer, and it’ll be a good test for whichever team qualifies.<br /><br />I actually don’t know <b>[how the second leg will go]</b> because I’m not sure what Jesse will do, and I’m not sure what I’ll do yet based upon the personnel. I’m sure it’ll be a physical game. There’ll be lots of mistakes as there were today. Hopefully it’s an enjoyable one because we’ll have 15,000 there next week hopefully, so I think they’ll be behind us and it’ll be a good start to the season for us if we get a good result. I’m looking forward to it. It should be exciting next week, so make sure everyone watches</p>

  <p><b>[The Vancouver Whitecaps announced Monday that veteran midfielder Mauro Rosales has re-joined the club one a one-year contract, with a team option for 2018]</b> Mauro is a senior player who brings tremendous leadership and commitment to our locker room, someone who can connect with players while still playing with them. We missed him last year both for what he brought on and off the field. We have some talented young attacking players, and along with our coaching staff, Mauro is one of the best ones to teach them. He brings professionalism, the right attitude, and demands the best from teammates. He is a welcome addition back to our club.</p>

  <p><b>[Carl Robinson expressed pride in his players efforts versus Mexican club Tigres UANL, despite losing the first leg of their <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League semi-final tie 2-0 in Mexico]</b> I asked them to not leave anything on the pitch and leave no regrets and they certainly done that. <b>[Tigres]</b> were the better team on the night. The game panned out as I thought it would in relation to the type of game it was. We knew they’d have lots of possession and try and put us under pressure in certain ways. It was disappointing that the goals came from two little details that we didn’t get right. We’ve got a second leg, and we’re still very much in the tie, if we can get that first goal</p>
