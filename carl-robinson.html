  <p><b>[Carl Robinson on his Vancouver Whitecaps side’s rivalry with FC Dallas]</b> It’s players wanting to win, managers wanting to win, and with that comes a competitive edge. I’d prefer that than just be matey - matey and friends all the time - and on the field the players pick each other up when they have physical contact. I watch the hockey and it’s brilliant, and maybe I can turn my team into that a little bit - without the fighting</p>

  <p><b>[Carl Robinson expressed pride in his players efforts versus Mexican club Tigres UANL, despite losing the first leg of their <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League semi-final tie 2-0 in Mexico]</b> I asked them to not leave anything on the pitch and leave no regrets and they certainly done that. <b>[Tigres]</b> were the better team on the night. The game panned out as I thought it would in relation to the type of game it was. We knew they’d have lots of possession and try and put us under pressure in certain ways. It was disappointing that the goals came from two little details that we didn’t get right. We’ve got a second leg, and we’re still very much in the tie, if we can get that first goal</p>
