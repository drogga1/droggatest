  <p>[Augsburg left-back Philipp Max is keen on a move to the Premier League] I have a contract with Augsburg. In football, you can never rule anything out but I firmly believe that in the second half [of the season] I will play for FCA.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Philipp Max saw his performances for Augsburg last season sparked talk of interest from Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain] It was an intense period where much was written, spoken and discussed. I’m just glad that the transfer window is closed now and I can focus on my season in Augsburg. I have signed a long-term contract until 2022, but of course I want to continue to develop, play internationally and take the next step. In spite of everything, I feel very comfortable in Augsburg. My girlfriend comes from here, the club is like a family and offers young players the opportunity to develop in peace. When we look good as a team, it’s easier for individuals to look good as well.<br /><br />Some things are printed in the newspaper, some things are passed on through my agent. It was not that I had to deal with an offer. It was important for me to focus on the pre-season. I think that went well<br /><br />It always depends on whether there are specific requests. That was not the case this summer. That’s why it was always clear to me that I wanted to concentrate fully on Augsburg. I’m just glad that the topic can now take a rest</p>
