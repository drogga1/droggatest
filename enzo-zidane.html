  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane cannot wait for more first-team opportunities as he reflects on a special debut goal for Real Madrid in Wednesday’s battering of Cultural Leonesa]</b> To score on your Real Madrid debut is always a dream and I’m really happy it’s come at the Bernabeu and with a win. It’s been a very special night. I’ve had to wait for my chance and now it’s here. This is the beginning and I have to keep working to get more chances and help the team.<br /><br />The squad treat me and all of the other younger players really well. You learn things all the time just from watching the best players in the world. What’s more, there’s a really good vibe, the first-team players always give us a warm welcome, they offer us advice and are always there to help. That’s really important for a player like me as it allows me to enjoy my football with them</p>

  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane, the son of Real Madrid manager Zinedine, has left the Santiago Bernabeu to link up with Alaves on a three-year deal]</b> Deportivo Alaves wants to welcome Enzo Zidane and wishes him the best of luck for the new season. Welcome, Enzo!.</p>

  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane on facing Real Madrid and his father]</b> It’s going to be weird. Real Madrid are the club my life has revolved around, the team I’ve played with since I was eight. I played for them in all their age groups. It’s going to be a very special match, something rare but that’s a good thing.<br /><br />I’ve been lucky to have arrived at a club that’s welcomed me and helped me. It’s important for a player who changes his life. I’ve never lived this far from my family. My integration has been very good</p>

  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane has joined Rayo Majadahonda on loan from Real Madrid]</b> After several weeks of contact, and despite having several offers elsewhere in Spain and also abroad, Enzo Zidane has committed his belief to the project that is being built at CF Rayo Majadahonda for the club’s first season in professional football. It is an indication of what the club is aiming to achieve for the future and the sporting plans that have been developed for several years. All parties have made a great effort to reach an agreement of a loan for one year, although the intervention of the first-team coach Antonio Iriondo has been decisive in convincing the player of the importance he can have in the team and the professional growth that he can achieve this season in the league.</p>

  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane, the son of Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane, admits his surname has brought added challenges in his footballing career]</b> I’ve had it since I was little, and it’s always going to be that way. It’s not going to change, but I try to remove myself from it and focus on being the best possible Enzo. People compare you, criticise you, want more from you, and say you are there because you are somebody’s son. Others will be criticised for other things, but I try not to think about it. The most important thing is that my family are proud of me. I just think about growing up as Enzo and nothing else.<br /><br /><b>[He explained his reasons for leaving Madrid for Switzerland last summer]</b> I was 22 years old; after going through the academy and learning from the first team, my goal was to try other things and grow as a footballer. Madrid are the best team in the world and it is very difficult to find a space there, but the life of a player is like that. I wanted to leave to experience good moments elsewhere and have the same dream</p>

  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane has been linked with roles at Manchester United and Bayern Munich]</b> We all know that my father loves football and loves to coach. It’s most likely that he will return to coaching soon. Now he is resting because it’s something he needed. Even though managing Madrid is beautiful, it’s tough, with a lot of work<br /><br /><b>[Enzo Zidane admits that a big-money move to Juventus for Cristiano Ronaldo came as a surprise to everybody]</b> No one expected it. I personally didn’t. He decided to leave, and things are going very well for him. He is missed, but I think Madrid is huge and I have no doubt that they will adapt in order to achieve great things without Cristiano</p>

  <p><b>[Enzo Zidane on why his father returned to Real Madrid]</b> I’m happy, like any son with his father. I hope he comes out the best he can, I trust in his work and I support him as always.<br /><br /><b>[He]</b> always makes decisions with his heart and it worked out like that. When you do things with your heart they go well and I’m sure it will be great. If Real Madrid are now in good hands, I do not have the answer to that. It’s the people who speak, I’m happy as a son and as a Madrid fan<br /><br /><b>[Rayo Majadahonda cruised past Numancia with a 4-0 win]</b> At last we play a game in which we are calm at the end, a game with an advantage. The first part has been very good, the whole team entered tense, very well and getting goals. We have played several very good matches, what we always want to do better and we will keep trying every weekend with the best goal to get the maximum points this season</p>
