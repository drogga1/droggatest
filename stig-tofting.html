  <p>Football saved me. I always had that as a space where nothing could touch me. I went to see a psychologist, but no matter what happened, when I went on the pitch, I was in my own world. I could leave all the bad things outside and I delivered</p>

  <p><b>[Former Denmark enforcer Stig Tofting has said that he would like to see compatriot <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> rather than Real Madrid]</b> I’d rather see Christian at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. For <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he would have to sell a huge number of jerseys and he’s not such a glamour boy. In Madrid, a powerful man sits at the calculator thinking: ‘How much does <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> cost and how many jerseys can he sell?’. Christian is not the big superstar, he’s not big-gestured, he doesn’t want to be the centre of attention, he’s not a <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. He’s very introverted and down to earth. He lets his feet speak<br /><br /><b>[Tofting also suggested that <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a>’s lukewarm form could be down to the uncertainty over his future]</b> For me, Christian is currently the best Danish player in the world and he’s the biggest talent in Denmark since <a href="michael-laudrup.html">Michael Laudrup</a>. Even if he does not have a good day he still plays at a high level, as he has repeatedly demonstrated at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He’s not free in the head right now, but if Real deals with you, it does something to a player. I think he should decide for Bayern, which he fits like an arse in a bucket!</p>
