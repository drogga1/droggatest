<blockquote>
  <p>I consulted with my father before making the decision <b>[move from Pheu Thai to Palang Pracharath]</b>. He told me to talk with Mr <a href="suriya-jungrungreangkij.html">Suriya Jungrungreangkij</a> and Somsak Thepsuthin <b>[another key member of Three Allies]</b> and we found we could work together. so I decided to join the new party unconditionally. My priority is to keep my father healthy</p>
