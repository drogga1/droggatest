  <p><b>[Haiti’s Football Federation president Yves Jean-Bart recalls how the earthquake that brought the country to its knees spared nothing for the beautiful game]</b> Our national headquarters collapsed in just a few seconds. Of the 50 people present at the time of the earthquake one dozen were injured and 32 found dead<br /><br />We also lost inventories of national equipment; the federation’s archives were not recovered. Our trophies, the awards we have received throughout the history of the federation, pictures of witnesses of our glorious years were not found in the rubble. It was a complete disaster.<br /><br />On top of it all, right after the earthquake all fields were occupied by millions of refugees of the earthquake who had lost everything. Currently we no longer have any soccer field that we can use in Port-au-Prince and surrounding towns for a decent game<br /><br />We held a memorial service for our colleagues who did not make it in April on the site of our collapsed headquarters, an extremely moving ceremony. On our new website as well as our new headquarters we will have a special place dedicated to their memory, but we know it will never be enough to demonstrate our gratitude for all that they have done for soccer<br /><br />Overall, we would say that it is thanks to all the 208 associations of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, who showed us their support and affection that we never felt alone throughout this long journey. Since 2003 we’ve been going from one catastrophe to the next. Personally, I never imagined that there was so much solidarity in our family, such a passion to get back on track, everyday I see that the courage and the willpower is getting stronger and stronger<br /><br />What we are most satisfied with is being able to keep doing of all our activities just like before the quake. We are extremely proud of being able to get back up and handling every situation going on in our country. Haiti never really had much except for talent and the passion for soccer</p>

  <p><b>[Amid the suffering and turmoil, soccer remained an escape for young Haitians, many of whom could not attend school for months]</b> They still play. It is the only entertainment reserved for everybody. We distributed the few balls we were able to recover and it was an explosion of joy</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA launches new exchange platform for its member associations]</b> We’ve enjoyed a familiar atmosphere, a football-loving atmosphere, with deep discussions at the same time. I’ve heard comments from African colleagues that have shown me that the world of football is the same everywhere and we all face the same issues. I think we should get to know each other better, understand each other better, appreciate each other more and probably develop joint actions.<br /><br />It gives us the opportunity to give and receive feedback about projects and programmes. We receive clarification and can better understand some topics that we often find unclear</p>
