  <p><b>[David Seaman thinks it is clear that Joe Hart is better than both Claudio Bravo and Willy Caballero after England’s number one goalkeeper was ditched in the summer]</b> I must say I’m having a little chuckle <b>[at City’s goalkeeper situation]</b>. When you see what Joe’s capable of and what’s going on there at the moment, it’s a shame. The decision was made and that’s it. I’m glad that Joe is playing high-quality football and then when he comes back with England, he still performs like we know he can do. I know Joe is a good goalkeeper. I’ve always rated him very highly - not just because of what he does on the pitch, but because of the way he reacts to setbacks.<br /><br />He’s had a few and he didn’t have the best Euros, but he’s reacted properly from it. He’s still performing and when you look at the guys who are replacing him <b>[at City]</b>, they’re nowhere near as good. Joe is winning anyway, because he’s still playing high-level football. He’s still performing to great levels and then coming back, playing for England and showing what he can do. For me, his levels haven’t dropped</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend David Seaman has backed Arsene Wenger to continue at the Emirates Stadium]</b> Mourinho has gone in to Manchester United and won three trophies last season. Ok, they are not playing the best football, but it is not negative football. It is building on a defence and that is what we did at Arsenal for a long time. We need to get back to that. When I went to Arsenal, we didn’t play the most attractive football but it was effective football and it won trophies. It is all about winning trophies, for me.<br /><br /><b>[Wenger may have ended the season without Champions League football]</b> For me they have made the right move. I think it could have been done a little earlier, but I’m happy that he signed</p>

  <p><b>[Wenger must do whatever it takes to keep PSG target Alexis at Arsenal]</b> <b>[Arsene Wenger’s]</b> main problem is going to be holding on to Alexis Sanchez. I would do whatever it takes to hold on to him because he’s a quality player who you wouldn’t want to be leaving the club, especially to your rivals. Sanchez-type players are the ones Arsenal should be bringing in.<br /><br />To replace him, It’d be hard. What are they going to get for him? He’s got a year left on his contract, his price-tag, I’d guess, would be around £50-70 million - you can’t guarantee spending that money and getting a player as good as Sanchez. He’s a guy who is just brilliant all over the pitch<br /><br />I think that is more or less settled now. I think he’s going to stay. He’s another one of those players who splits the fans but he’s a quality player. You can’t take that away from him - when he’s on his game he is brilliant. It’s just the way he looks on the pitch sometimes, like he’s not trying, but trust me he is, you can tell he is. It’s the same situation as Sanchez, you don’t want players of the standard leaving Arsenal. Arsenal were at this stage a few years ago when Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy left - they were reaching their prime but leaving. It was sad. I think the club have moved on from that now and they can offer the right contracts for the big players and also pay the fees</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger requires additional top-class players if Arsenal are to challenge for the Premier League title this season]</b> Arsenal need more players - more top-class players. They’ve got Lacazette, which is a good signing, but I still think they need a couple more. Whether they are in the pipeline I don’t know. I think they need a central midfield player - a holding midfielder - a Patrick Vieira type midfield player. One with a lot of presence and strength, with the ability to control games like Patrick used to. Then maybe a centre-half. Mertesacker is coming back now - I watched him play last weekend, and he looked as good as ever. I don’t think he’ll ever look as good as he did in the FA Cup final, that was brilliant to watch, but with over 100 caps for Germany, we know he can play.<br /><br /><b>[Asked what would represent a successful season for Arsenal, and indeed Wenger, in 2017-18]</b> Winning a trophy is always a successful season. And being in the top four. For Arsenal to win the league, I feel they’re a few players short, looking at other squads. I think they just need a couple. They’ve been there or there abouts for a long time now but never been in with a really good chance in the last few weeks of the season - so adding a couple of players might change that</p>

  <p><b>[Wojciech Szczesny’s decision to ditch Arsenal for Juventus backed by club legend David Seaman]</b> It’s a shame. I don’t like quality goalkeepers like that leaving Arsenal. Arsenal obviously have Cech, Ospina is still there, and Emiliano Martinez is coming through who is doing well. I think it’s good for Wojciech because it means that he’s going to be playing at a big club in Juventus - but there’s a certain issue of getting ahead of <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon there!.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether the two years in Rome could have been enough to convince those at Arsenal to invest in Szczesny as the long-term number one at the club]</b> I don’t think there’s a place for him - Wenger has two experienced goalkeepers now so if he’d stayed at Arsenal he would’ve ended up playing reserve team football.<br /><br />You can’t compare him <b>[Szczesny]</b> to Cech, because he <b>[Cech]</b> has been there and done everything, he’s won everything - with Wojciech, he’s at an age now where he needs to be playing because it’s easy to stay as a number two, then it becomes too easy. You need to be testing yourself. I don’t think he would be ahead of Ospina, only because of how Arsene Wenger plays Ospina in all the Champions League games and Cech in the Premier League games. For me, though, I don’t think it was because of ability, because he’s got a lot of it, it was just Arsene prefers those two</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman believes the physical nature of the Premier League could see new Gunners signing Alexandre Lacazette initially struggle to adapt to life in England]</b> It will be difficult for him to get used to the Premier League. A lot of new signings find it difficult to settle because they don’t realise how fast and how physical it is, and how fast the games come round. Sometimes you’re playing two or three times a week. He will get used to it - from what I’ve seen he does look quality. People said he reminds them of Ian Wright, but he has to score a few more goals to remind me of him!</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal and England goalkeeper David Seaman believes Jordan Pickford has everything he needs to be a success at Everton]</b> His current ability - he’s very good - he’s got everything he needs. Obviously he’s still learning, With Sunderland last season he had a lot to do, which was great for him because he was able to show what he can do. But he’s made another step up now and what he’ll find out is that he won’t have as much to do, but he’ll still need to be ready when needed.<br /><br />That’s one of the hardest parts of goalkeeping - being ready when you haven’t had a lot to do. But his ability is there for everyone to see. He’s still got to learn - he’s still got to learn how to deal with mistakes, because all goalkeepers make mistakes, but he’ll be getting more experience and he’ll be learning how to deal with those better.<br /><br /><b>[Asked where Pickford ranks in Gareth Southgate’s pecking order]</b> I don’t know where he stands because Joe is now at West Ham, which is great for him. Joe has massive experience because he’s played at the highest level for a long, long time, whereas with Jordan, he’s not played as much.<br /><br />There are steps - Sunderland to Everton, then even Everton to one of the bigger clubs, like one of the top four clubs, then it’s Champions League, then it’s playing for England, then it’s playing in a World Cup. There are little steps and it’s added pressure every time. But the more experience he gets the easier he will find it to deal with that pressure.<br /><br />Where he stands - he’s in front of a few of the other goalkeepers, but all he can do is see how it goes for Everton. He’s got to do his job there, do as well as he did with Sunderland and he’ll really start pushing</p>

He’s been at big clubs before, he knows what he wants from his team and he’ll know what sort of players he wants as well. So for me, you need someone with that sort of stature to go into Arsenal and say: ‘Right, I want X, Y, and Z, otherwise I’m not coming.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil has been told that he has turn up more often]</b> I can understand the frustration with Ozil. When he’s on song, he is fantastic, but there have been quite a few times in big games when he just hasn’t turned up and last night was one of them. Sometimes he looks like he’s not bothered or he’s getting upset and he’s not happy with other players, but I think that’s just the way he plays. It’s so frustrating because he’s got so much talent and he is such a good player, but he needs to turn up more often. I can totally understand why the fans are so frustrated.<br /><br />Over the two ties it was down to two basic defending mistakes. Once Atletico went 1-0 up it was game-over. We all know they can defend a lead, they remind me so much of the old Arsenal. I think Bellerin is a better attacker than he is a defender, and for a right-back it should be totally the other way around. He’s got the pace but, for me, there’s just an art to defending and it looks like he’s lost it a little bit</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal remain at least three signings short of pushing back into the Premier League’s top four]</b> You’ve got to progress on the season before and we were out of the top four and we were getting left behind by quite a few of the big clubs. We need to regroup, have a little restructure of the team and then push on, get into the Champions League again and try and improve on that each season. It’s not going to be easy because the big guns are quite a way ahead at the moment. We need steel in the team. We need a couple of defenders, dominant defenders, and a dominant midfield player. I think the forward side of it, you can leave that alone because we’ve got a lot of firepower there. I’m just a little bit worried about the defence and the art of defending</p>

  <p><b>[David Seaman sees Pickford joining top Premier League club after England heroics]</b> Jordan Pickford will probably end up at one of the top six clubs in the Premier League if he keeps progressing. He’ll make it hard for the big clubs to ignore him. He needs that challenge, because he’s not even played Champions League football yet. He’s just skipped that and gone straight to the World Cup and showed he can do it there. He had a great tournament. He’s a quality goalkeeper and has got to keep doing it.<br /><br />If I’m honest, when the choice was between Pickford and Butland before the World Cup, I’d have probably gone with Jack, because he was a bit more consistent for me. But Jordan had a great competition, with some stunning saves and won a penalty shootout. He just needs to keep improving now, and a move to a big club could do that. Pickford is among the top guys in the Premier League now, but he’s got to do it for a longer time to be classed as good as David De Gea, Thibaut Courtois, Petr Cech and Hugo Lloris</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal coach Unai Emery would be wrong to get rid of Petr Cech after the arrival of new goalkeeper Bernd Leno]</b> I don’t think <b>[Cech]</b> will get written off straight away. You don’t disregard that experience from a guy that has won everything in the Premier League and he has won the Champions League as well. Don’t disregard that. He has still got a lot to offer. What is interesting is that Petr has took the number one jersey. So that means that he wants to stay around for a little while. It is going to be difficult. I would imagine that one of <b>[Cech or David Ospina]</b> will leave. I am always cautious as to when a goalkeeper comes into the Premier League because it takes them a little while to get used to it. If you think back to David De Gea, he really struggled in his first season at Man United but he has really pushed on since then. So if Leno is the number one it will be interesting just to see how he adapts to the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery must still prove himself in the transfer market despite Arsenal going on a 22-match unbeaten run]</b> Emery has got his players playing with confidence. That’s hugely important when you’ve got so many youngsters. But he still needs a couple of transfer windows to really put his stamp on that team - a lot of this side is still Arsene Wenger’s. But they’re playing well together, they’re playing with confidence and it’s great to see. Getting back into the top four would be a great season. It’s going to be tough. I think the top two are going to run away with it, and probably Manchester City will win it. But the next two places are going to be difficult, with us, Chelsea, Spurs and Manchester United all in there.<br /><br />That win against Spurs was a ­fantastic result, not just because of the victory - but because we came back from 2-1 down. That was great for me to see ­because I didn’t know if that team had it in them - to be under such pressure in a big game but then produce like they did. It was a surprise to go up to the Man United game as favourites but that showed how far this team has ­already come</p>

Well, that’s what you’d have to pay to get someone like Aaron Ramsey anyway, you’d probably have to pay a little bit more. It’s demoralising for me, and I’m sure it’s even more demoralising for the fans to hear that, and then to see quality players leaving the club again.<br /><br /><b>[On seeing Ramsey become the latest player allowed to run down his contract]</b> That’s even more frustrating, the fact that it’s for nothing, that’s why he’s getting so much money when he goes to Juventus. I don’t get it, I don’t know what the forward thinking is. The fact that Emery gets one transfer window, gets told he can only do loan deals. Now we’re looking at the end of the season when it gets towards his second transfer window, and he’s told he’s only got £40-44m to spend, so frustrating</p>

But, obviously, time’s a healer and he could think, ‘I want to go back there and prove a few people wrong’. For me, Arsene got a lot of criticism that wasn’t deserved over his last few years at Arsenal. It looks like there could be a vacancy at Chelsea quite soon, depending on their next three games, which are three big games for Chelsea. He’d be great there, I think. He’d be great anywhere, he’s a fantastic manager. I would love to see him back, but I don’t think it would happen.</p>

He’s a true professional and even if he is going to join <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, that wouldn’t make any difference to his performance</h4>

  <p><b>[David Seaman says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in danger of being left further behind]</b> Give him some money. Give him a transfer window. There have been two transfer windows that have gone by and he’s had nothing. The board need to back him or otherwise we are going to be left further behind.<br /><br /><b>[Seaman added on that contest and what it means for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a>]</b> I thought first-half we were okay, second-half we were poor. There was some poor defending, but that’s been a hallmark of the season. It’s something that has needed addressing for three or four years now, so it’s frustrating. With <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s performance, it was same old, same old, so frustrating. It just shows how much work Emery has to do</p>

  <p><b>[A frustrated David Seaman says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are likely to fare much worse than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the summer transfer window]</b> It’s so frustrating at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because the club is running on a good profit. The fans are frustrated at the moment, especially after the result in the Europa League final against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was a disappointing result, it was made a little bit better by the weekend result <b>[arch rivals <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> being beaten by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the Champions League final]</b>, but it’s so disappointing. They’re struggling. It’s just so frustrating being an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan and an ex-Arsenal player at the moment. You know what the club is capable of, so you’re just like, ‘come on, let’s see what you’ve got!’. When you look at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, they’re in a very similar situation - they both need to strengthen at the back and they’re both without Champions League football, so it’s going to be testing times. But I’d say United are in a better place than <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because of their buying power and the money they will pay for players</p>

I know they’ve got some really talented young keepers in <a href="emiliano-martinez.html">Emi Martinez</a>, Deyan Iliev, Matt Macey and Arthur Okonkwo, but I just think they could do with an older number two. Those lads are real talents but they’ve not got an awful lot of experience at the top, top level. It would be a big step for them to come in and be Leno’s number two in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after being on loan or playing for the U23s. I don’t think they need someone like Schubert as Leno’s number two either - why not look at <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> or Jack Butland as a number two? They have loads of experience.

It’s no good having the best players in the world up front if you don’t have a solid defence. It’s no secret that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to strengthen their defence, certainly after missing out on Champions League qualification. I think Tierney would be an ideal addition for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He’s young, he’s talented. I think I’m right in saying he’s already captained his club and country and by all accounts he’s a hard worker with a great attitude. Being British, he’d also settle in straight away and there would be no period of adjustment. I really think they should be looking to sign Tierney before setting their sights on <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Seaman added on the qualities that 22-year-old Scotland international Tierney would bring to the fold in north London]</b> He’s a leader and he’s tenacious.

He should have more respect for the club. When I first heard about him not going on tour I was really disappointed. As club captain he should know better. If he wanted to get a move he should have done it behind closed doors, spoken to the manager and told him his situation - there must have been something going on. And then the video, even if it was done by the club he went to, he should have more class than that. He should have said: ‘No I’m not doing that, I respect <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a lot more than that, let’s just do the normal photograph’. So to do that, I thought it was a disgrace</p>

There’s a lot of stuff that needs sorting out, obviously the manager but the team needs sorting as well. We just look so bad at the back and it’s frustrating that nothing has been done.

Being a goalkeeper, you make mistakes and you do get criticised. I saw a stat saying he’d made the most mistakes or whatever, but he made a lot of saves in those games as well. A lot of people have been talking about him as Player of the Season at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because he’s had a lot to do, which is surprising for an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team because we’re normally really good at defending.

I like him as a manager, I like what he says and, from what I’ve heard on the training ground, it’s really good as well. I think it’s going to be a bit of a longer process than what a lot of people thought. In the summer, or at the end of the season when the transfer window opens, it’s going to be a big test for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as to who comes in and who goes out<br /><br />Even getting top five is going to be a big ask this season because confidence now is really low. We need to start giving the fans something to cheer about because, at the moment, it’s hard to watch Arsenal</p>
