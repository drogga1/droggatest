  <p><b>[Seaman said the USA game was a good start to England’s World Cup campaign to win the tournament]</b> I think that could possibly be the hardest game but you’ve got to be very happy with that draw. That is a big pressure game but with two evening kick-offs to start you can get the points and then you’re coasting. I’m very happy with that group</p>

  <p><b>[David Seaman on Thierry Henry]</b> What do you say about a guy like <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> ? He was phenomenal, just phenomenal. In training, he was brilliant. He was proper. I’ve seen Martin (Keown), Tony (Adams), Sol (Campbell), and <a href="steve-bould.html">Steve Bould</a> kicking lumps out him, but he just got up and gave them some back. He was a proper athlete. He could change the game in a flash, from defense straight up to attack. <b>[. . .]</b> When he came in, he was a young man, but he changed really quickly, and you could see the power and pace that he had, but he had a focus on finishing that was really special… He was like a Rolls-Royce, he could turn that accelerator pedal on anytime he wanted</p>

  <p><b>[David Seaman says Petr Cech should not start in goal for Arsenal in next week’s Europa League final against Chelsea]</b> My only thing is that Arsenal really need this; they need this more than Chelsea. They need to get into the Champions League and I’m always for playing your strongest team. That means Leno, but I’m sure Cech will play because it’s his last ever game<br /><br /><b>[The former England number one also made it clear that his opinion had nothing to do with the news that Cech was returning to Chelsea]</b> I was surprised when I heard it. I was really surprised at the timing of it. I was thinking, ‘is that Chelsea that’s brought that out, or someone from Arsenal?’. Nothing’s been confirmed yet, so if Petr plays I wouldn’t be worried at all. He’s a true professional and even if he is going to join Chelsea, that wouldn’t make any difference to his performance</p>

  <p><b>[David Seaman says Arsenal are in danger of being left further behind]</b> Give him some money. Give him a transfer window. There have been two transfer windows that have gone by and he’s had nothing. The board need to back him or otherwise we are going to be left further behind.<br /><br /><b>[Seaman added on that contest and what it means for the Gunners]</b> I thought first-half we were okay, second-half we were poor. There was some poor defending, but that’s been a hallmark of the season. It’s something that has needed addressing for three or four years now, so it’s frustrating. With Arsenal’s performance, it was same old, same old, so frustrating. It just shows how much work Emery has to do</p>

  <p><b>[A frustrated David Seaman says Arsenal are likely to fare much worse than Manchester United in the summer transfer window]</b> It’s so frustrating at Arsenal because the club is running on a good profit. The fans are frustrated at the moment, especially after the result in the Europa League final against Chelsea. It was a disappointing result, it was made a little bit better by the weekend result <b>[arch rivals Tottenham being beaten by Liverpool in the Champions League final]</b>, but it’s so disappointing. They’re struggling. It’s just so frustrating being an Arsenal fan and an ex-Arsenal player at the moment. You know what the club is capable of, so you’re just like, ‘come on, let’s see what you’ve got!’. When you look at Manchester United and Arsenal, they’re in a very similar situation - they both need to strengthen at the back and they’re both without Champions League football, so it’s going to be testing times. But I’d say United are in a better place than Arsenal because of their buying power and the money they will pay for players</p>

I wouldn’t have thought <b>[<a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilf Zaha</a> will be wearing the Arsenal shirt]</b>, I’d be very surprised if he did. I’d rather see a good defender wearing it!</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend David Seaman has suggested that the Gunners should be considering <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> and Jack Butland as they look to bring another goalkeeper onto their books]</b> I think they should be trying to get a more experienced keeper in as <b>[Bernd]</b> Leno’s number two. I know they’ve got some really talented young keepers in Emi Martinez, Deyan Iliev, Matt Macey and Arthur Okonkwo, but I just think they could do with an older number two. Those lads are real talents but they’ve not got an awful lot of experience at the top, top level. It would be a big step for them to come in and be Leno’s number two in the Premier League after being on loan or playing for the U23s. I don’t think they need someone like Schubert as Leno’s number two either - why not look at <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> or Jack Butland as a number two? They have loads of experience. That’s the sort of quality they should be looking at as the club’s number two at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[David Seaman says Arsenal need to be prioritising Kieran Tierney over <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> in their ongoing bid to bring fresh faces into the Emirates Stadium]</b> Yes, <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> is a good player who could do well for the club, and yes I know I would say as a former goalkeeper that the defence is the first place to look at in terms of signing new players - but the simple fact is that the backline needs strengthening. It’s no good having the best players in the world up front if you don’t have a solid defence. It’s no secret that Arsenal need to strengthen their defence, certainly after missing out on Champions League qualification. I think Tierney would be an ideal addition for Arsenal. He’s young, he’s talented. I think I’m right in saying he’s already captained his club and country and by all accounts he’s a hard worker with a great attitude. Being British, he’d also settle in straight away and there would be no period of adjustment. I really think they should be looking to sign Tierney before setting their sights on <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Seaman added on the qualities that 22-year-old Scotland international Tierney would bring to the fold in north London]</b> He’s a leader and he’s tenacious. It’s always good to have leaders in the defence and Tierney would certainly be that<br /><br />I don’t think they need someone like Markus Schubert as Bernd Leno’s number two either - why not look at <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> or Jack Butland as a number two?

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny has been branded a disgrace by Arsenal legend David Seaman. The 33-year-old refused to travel with the Gunners to a pre-season tour in America, forcing the club to open disciplinary proceedings]</b> It left a really bad taste in the mouth. He should have more respect for the club. When I first heard about him not going on tour I was really disappointed. As club captain he should know better. If he wanted to get a move he should have done it behind closed doors, spoken to the manager and told him his situation - there must have been something going on. And then the video, even if it was done by the club he went to, he should have more class than that. He should have said: ‘No I’m not doing that, I respect Arsenal a lot more than that, let’s just do the normal photograph’. So to do that, I thought it was a disgrace</p>

The fans were told <b>[Arsenal were]</b> moving to the Emirates to be a bigger and better club and things haven’t worked out. There’s a lot of stuff that needs sorting out, obviously the manager but the team needs sorting as well. We just look so bad at the back and it’s frustrating that nothing has been done. And we’re not just leaking goals, we’re giving so many chances away as well. It’s embarrassing</p>

Being a goalkeeper, you make mistakes and you do get criticised. I saw a stat saying he’d made the most mistakes or whatever, but he made a lot of saves in those games as well. A lot of people have been talking about him as Player of the Season at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because he’s had a lot to do, which is surprising for an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team because we’re normally really good at defending. But that just shows where we are at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Arteta]</b> can’t get players in now. He will try to revitalise them, but he’s coaching them now. It’s not like you can go in and change it overnight. He needs a lot of time to coach and he will do that. I like him as a manager, I like what he says and, from what I’ve heard on the training ground, it’s really good as well. I think it’s going to be a bit of a longer process than what a lot of people thought. In the summer, or at the end of the season when the transfer window opens, it’s going to be a big test for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as to who comes in and who goes out<br /><br />Even getting top five is going to be a big ask this season because confidence now is really low. We need to start giving the fans something to cheer about because, at the moment, it’s hard to watch Arsenal</p>
