  <p><b>[Udinese goalkeeper Juan Musso says <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> is physically devastating]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is physically devastating. He has a nice left foot and he’s an intelligent player, he always makes the right decision in the final third. He’s formed a beautiful partnership with Lautaro<br /><br />I grew up with Lautaro at Racing Avellaneda. We arrived in Italy at the same time, two years ago, and we still haven’t been able to see each other off the pitch. We speak on WhatsApp though, and we see each other with the national team. He’s always focused. He brings out the best of himself in any situation. He arrived at Racing at the age of 17 and immediately we saw how strong he was. He has the mentality of a big-game player. He’s the complete attacker. He always has the ball under control, he can work with his back to goal and he can shoot from anywhere<br /><br /><b>[Musso is also a fan of Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, though he feels <a href="jan-oblak.html">Jan Oblak</a> and <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> are ahead of him]</b> The strongest goalkeeper in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is Handanovic. I like him because he is calm and good with the ball at his feet. The best in the world is <a href="jan-oblak.html">Oblak</a> of <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, then Ter Stegen of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Then it’s Handanovic again</p>
