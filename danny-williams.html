<blockquote>
  <p>[Danny Williams is not looking back after being left out of the squad’s failed 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign] The thing with the American thing is that football is a game of opinions and I can’t change a few opinions of previous managers. But the new manager gives me all the confidence and made me captain against Portugal, so we shall see. I haven’t changed as a player and have played the same my whole life. If the previous managers did not think that was good enough for whatever reason and that the MLS is maybe better than the Championship, it is up to them. Whenever I get invited to the national team, it is up to me to show I am up for it and can add some quality to the team. And hopefully the new manager can see that.<br /><br />I am always hoping to be involved when it comes to representing your country. It is a big honor and last time when I was captain, it was a big, big honor for me and my family, so I am looking forward to more of that as well</p>
