<blockquote>
  <p><a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> has reportedly described that assaults with machine guns and electrocution are torture methods used in an Egyptian prison<br /><br />A letter said to be written by him was reportedly smuggled out of the prison and reported on by The Times Ireland today. He describes torture that inmates in the Wadi el-Natrun prison endure. 
Halawa said that prisoners are forced to watch each other being tortured. Some of the methods include being beaten with plastic pipes, electrocuted and being hit with machine guns<br /><br />Halawa wakes up everyday to the screams of prisoners being tortured<br /><br /><a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a>’s family and supporters held an awareness day on Dublin’s Grafton Street to allow people to see pictures of him and to learn about his detention<br /><br />His family released a section of a letter he wrote to them in the last week to mark the 1,000 days<br /><br />The Halawas insist Ibrahim has been jailed without a fair trial and no adequate access to a lawyer, and claim he has been -electrocuted, beaten, spat on and moved without his family’s knowledge. They have also criticised the efforts of the Department of Foreign Affairs over what they claim is a ‘softly, softly’ approach by diplomats with Egyptian authorities<br /><br />Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan has ordered talks amid the controversy of Mr <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> being moved from prison to prison, and sent Ireland’s ambassador to Egypt Damien Cole to discuss the matter with officials in Cairo. He has also brought in the Egyptian ambassador Soha Gendi in Dublin as part of the diplomatic process.<br /><br />Ms <a href="lynn-boylan.html">Lynn Boylan</a> called on the new cabinet members to ask Taoiseach Enda Kenny to take up the case personally and seek the Egyptian presidential decree</p>
