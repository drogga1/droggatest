  <p><b>[Bebeto speaks about the current Brazil side]</b> I will never forget it. I was a bit traumatised by that defeat to Germany, but I think <a href="tite.html">Tite</a> has restored the credibility that we lost. Now you can feel how much the players want it, how hard they are fighting. Their current achievements and is only the beginning, there is still much more to come<br /><br />We have to remain quiet and let <a href="tite.html">Tite</a> do his job. He is already forming a great team and he will continue like that, I have no doubt about it. We have to show patience and let him work<br /><br />In Brazil there is always so much emphasis on the immediate. Everything had to happen right away, all at the same time, but football doesn’t work like that<br /><br /><b>[Could <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> be the new double act set to lead Brazil to glory?]</b> I think there’s still a long way to go. <a href="romario.html">Romario</a> was a killer, we understood each other perfectly. It’s going to take a while for them. They can win things for Brazil and make a great pair, but they are still just starting out. Bebeto and <a href="romario.html">Romario</a> was without doubt one of the greatest pairings of all time<br /><br /><b>[Bebeto refuses to label the Selecao as favourites in Russia]</b> Let’s not pick favourites. We’ll keep quiet, because I think we have a great team. Of course, when Brazil goes to a World Cup they will always be contenders, but there’s a long road ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Bebeto on <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius Junior</a> who just officially a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> player. The 16-year-old had moved from <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> for 45 million euros]</b> He’s got to go calmly, he’s only 16. I started to play professionally at that age. I know <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius</a>, he’s a good guy, calm, with a good head. He’s a very quick and intelligent player, he knows how to score goals. I think that he has everything to be a great player but we’ve got to stay calm. If the lad didn’t have his family it would be more difficult, but he’s got a good head</p>

He has to be an example. We have to talk about <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> making goals, helping the Brazilian team. I’m very supportive of him, because he’s a great player and any team in the world has a place for him</p>

I want that everything can go well and that we can win this title, that’s so important. Not only for <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> fans but for all Brazilians. <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> is playing very well, they will fight for this title, it will be a tough game, we all know this. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a great team, they are Champions League winners and we are Libertadores winners and also winners at Brazil Championship.

  <p><b>[Gabriel Veron: Brazil’s teenage star named after an Argentina legend]</b> Gabriel Veron is a kid with enormous talent. I looked for more information about him and I was impressed once I saw him wearing the No.7 producing beautiful plays. I watched him score a goal dribbling from almost his own half before finding the net with a quality finish, calmly beating the opposition goalkeeper.</p>
