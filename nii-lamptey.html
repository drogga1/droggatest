  <p><b>[What ever happened to Nii Lamptey?]</b> The expectations on me were very, very huge.<br /><br /><b>[His inability to read or write meant that he was exploited mercilessly by greedy and manipulative money-men, particularly the infamous Italian agent Antonio Caliendo]</b> I was cheated so much. I didn’t even know I had a right to a signing-on fee. The Aston Villa manager, Ron Atkinson, told me, and in the club office they gave it straight to me. Two weeks later, my agent came over and I think he went to the club to get the money. They said they had given it to the player. He was very upset with me. There were so many people cheating me, just looking after their own interests<br /><br />Education is very important. Education was a big problem for me. I didn’t have time to go to school. I lost so many things. I couldn’t read or write. Knowing the pain I went through at that time, I don’t want kids to go through that<br /><br />Even if I say I’m a failure in football, God wouldn’t punish me. I have been through hell. But I enjoy my life now, I can take care of my family. I am okay</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> attacker Nii Lamptey has advised compatriot and <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> ace <a href="thomas-partey.html">Thomas Partey</a> against making a move to England]</b> There are numerous offers coming for <a href="thomas-partey.html">Thomas Partey</a> but his career will take a nosedive if he doesn’t choose his next move well. The country and league he will pick will determine his future. I would advise him to stay in Spain rather than going to England or Italy. Per style of play, he can move within Spain and join another top club rather than focusing on the financial gains to move out of the country because that can be suicidal. Sometimes, decision making can destroy your career. My move to England was a wrong one for me. <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> was a wrong move because their style of play was not going to suit me. If I had gone to France or Spain at that time, it would have helped my career more than going to England</p>
