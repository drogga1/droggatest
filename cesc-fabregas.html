We eventually spoke on the phone and all is fine. It really irked me that my level of commitment was doubted. I’ve played many times and been involved in call-ups without playing. I’ve played 94 games for Spain over the past nine years. I had tendinitis in my left hamstring. If I played I could have ended up with an injury not to dissimilar to that of Modric. I told Ramos at the time that if he has something to say to me then he should pick up the phone and call and not send messages via the media. We’ve been playing together since we were in the Under-21 team together.</p>

He’s good at creating space.<br /><br />Pique must carry on playing, being the best centre-back he can be and giving everything for the team to win the critics over. Time heals everything<br /><br />We’re now the leaders and it’s likely we’ll qualify for the European Championship. We had a great first half against Slovakia and I think we gave a very complete performance. The squad is full of top players and hopefully we’ll continue to do well</p>

  <p><b>[Cesc Fabregas reflects on Spain career]</b> Time goes by and it goes by very quickly. I consider myself very lucky in football and in life. To see yourself playing a part in the quarter-finals of a European Championship, taking a very important penalty, in a semi-final giving two assists, winning a European Championship, the national team’s first, being one of the key players in the final of a World Cup, being involved in the most important goal in Spain’s history …<br /><br />That moment - the quarter-finals between Spain and Italy - was one of the best that I have experienced in my career. At just 21 to be able to experience that unique moment, and that winning the World Cup is the top level for a footballer and there’s nothing bigger, so that European Championship, those moments were very, very nice<br /><br /><b>[On the opportunity to play in his third Euros]</b> It doesn’t happen every day and to be able to play my third European Championship, the same as three World Cups, is something that doesn’t happen a lot.

I remember in the Netherlands game, which we lost 5-1, we were winning 1-0 and <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> was one-on-one with the goalkeeper. If he scored that it would have been 2-0, and no chance for them. We’d have probably won and the confidence would have been very different.

I’ve played football for a long time and played with top, top players and he has all the quality, I know what he can do. I have told him that it’s up to him, I like to be honest. In my opinion, he has the quality. Without the ball he’s very difficult to bring down and get the ball off him. When he is on top of his game he’s up there with the very best.</p>

  <p><b>[Messi joins Hazard and Henry in Fabregas’ dream five-a-side]</b> What can I say about him? Whatever I say I’m sure it’s been repeated by everyone else. He’s the best player of all time. It’s unfair on the old players because I was not lucky enough to watch them week-in week-out, but to be the best in every single game during so many years every three days in the conditions nowadays it’s tough. Everyone tactically, physically works better. He’s got to be the best for sure.<br /><br /><b>[Messi’s creativity is paired with that of Belgium star Hazard, with Fabregas a big fan of his Stamford Bridge colleague]</b> Top player. He can go one-on-one, can also hold the possession of the ball and has a great passing ability. I will go for him for my Chelsea pick. With Eden, in my opinion, it is up to him <b>[to aim for the Ballon D’Or]</b> because he’s got all the qualities. I’ve played with top players and I know what he can do. For this reason for me it’s up to him. In my opinion with the qualities he’s got, not only technically but without the ball, when he’s on the top of his game he’ll always be in my team<br /><br /><b>[On Thierry Henry]</b> I want to pick one player from every team that I’ve played for. He’s a fantastic player, one of the best in the world at his peak. At some point he was unstoppable. When I first came to Arsenal in 2003 he was at his peak and I’ve not seen many strikers play or handle defenders like how he used to do it. He was fantastic on his day and for Arsenal he was the hero of the team<br /><br /><b>[A man with ambitions to one day move into coaching]</b> I’ve played for the very best so I’m going to go for the future very best which is… me. They are the kind of players I would love to have in my team and I think I can handle this team. I could make them play well</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[No crisis at Chelsea but concedes Premier League title hopes are over]</b> I don’t think so to be honest. I think we are all professional players. We are players that are used to the speculation and used to what is around us because we play for a big football club and there will always be rumours and things to be said. We just focus on football and our game. We are training very hard to achieve our targets, that’s the objective. I don’t really look or care or mind what is said about me anymore. Or what is said about the rest. When you look in football after scoring two goals you are the best and, if you lose, you become the worst. There’s no middle point in football anymore - either you are the best or you are bad. We just really have to focus in our job, which is to try to be good every three days, compete well and then let the results talk.<br /><br />The new signings had to adapt to what the coach asks to us and it was not easy. For example, some players had to play many games, like N’Golo <b>[Kante]</b>, myself or <b>[Cesar]</b> Azpilicueta maybe. We didn’t have a lot of available players and we had to play more than what we should have. In that case, maybe we struggled a little bit this year but I think we played OK, maybe not at our maximum level, or the level we used to show last year but it is still a good season. We are in the FA Cup, we are in the last 16 in the Champions League, we are three points off Manchester United who are second in the Premier League.<br /><br />We got to the semi-final of the Carabao Cup. When you look at it you can’t say it is an average or bad season, it is a good season. But, of course, when you call it a good or bad season, it is in May when there are trophies to be won and see what you can achieve. We come from two difficult defeats against Watford and Bournemouth where we did struggle and we were not ourselves. We didn’t play at the level required or the level we should have but apart from that we recovered well. We played well on Monday <b>[3-0 home win over West Brom]</b>. We played a good game, we won. The most important thing is the team plays well and grows again. That we get the confidence back because the next month and a half, two months, if you look at our calendar it is very tough and we will need every single player available.<br /><br />Let’s not lie to ourselves, the title is gone, I don’t know how many games are left but they are too many points on top. There’s no way they <b>[City]</b> will lose six games and the rest of the teams win everything. I cannot see this happening, obviously you can’t say never in football, and I hate to say that, but they are playing a fantastic season and it would be a miracle to catch them. For us the most important thing now is to reach the Champions League positions and we will go again in the Premier League. Then we still have two trophies that are very, very important to play for. That must be our aim for the season, to qualify for the Champions League and go for the two trophies we have left<br /><br />That probably was a comment that it was true that there was a moment that things were going so badly against us that you feel like you even forgot how to play. This maybe has been once in my life that this has happened, I said it in this way, maybe I exaggerated a little bit. The problem was in that moment when we had that interview we were maybe 16th or 17th! We just could not get a win, basically. It is frustrating the way it happened. It is all about experiences and how you cope with it. This season you cannot say it has been a bad season so far because there’s still a lot to play for</p>

Anyway, I don’t think about it because I keep my focus on performing here <b>[at Chelsea]</b>, but maybe it wouldn’t be strange to call someone who first came into the team 15 years ago. It is obvious that they already know me but it would be nice to get in. I am focusing now on my club because, in the end, if you don’t do right things in your club, it is impossible to receive the call. And if it finally arrives, perfect. If not, I will support the team from home.<br /><br />I haven’t been part of that team for a year and a half and I don’t know how they worked but Pedro and <b>[Cesar]</b> Azpilicueta used to go often.

I remember my first day, my first training with the first team or whatever you don’t feel that thing, but I have the hunger and the passion to keep playing, but in a good way, not in a nervous way. But I think experience goes with it. Definitely <b>[I try to help the younger players]</b>. It’s good always to be surrounded by players who give you confidence and I think that’s important - when you are young, even me now after 15 years, I make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes, but when you know that you are young and that everyone is looking at you, maybe you have to see what you can do, show me what you can do. You always wonder sometimes did I do well, did I do enough to prove myself, so it can cause a little bit of mental doubt. We need to be there for them, that’s 100 per cent sure.

That helped me a lot, I have to do that for them as well<br /><br />It was an opportunity for me to hit it first time, it was a good ball and once it was coming I just felt like everything had went well so I’m happy for that. It’s been a long time since I’ve scored - I was waiting for it to happen. It took longer than I expected but playing in this position it’s a little bit more difficult for me to get forward and to get into positions to score, but in this position with three midfielders I have a little bit more freedom to go forward, to play a bit more in my position I’ve played throughout my career and that’s it. I think this is the only change that I can see. We have been winning games, not comfortably but we have been winning which is the most important thing and I think sometimes when you are in a dip of form, you’re struggling to get points, to win whatever way or whatever it takes to do it is always positive and I think we’ve been doing well. The first half was good and maybe at the end we struggled a little bit, the last 10 minutes, because they could have scored, but I think we have to dig in, in certain moments, and we are ready to do that.<br /><br />Every team is fighting for something, 80 per cent of the league, so yes we played before <b>[Spurs]</b> this time - they are playing after us. We won so they will probably feel that they need to do well and not drop points anymore but in football anything can happen, every game is a final and let’s see what happens. We just have to keep winning. The advantage is for them <b>[Spurs and Liverpool]</b> because it’s not up to us - even if we win every game, if they do well, we will not be in the Champions League next year so it’s not up to us, so that’s why I would prefer to be in their position. I would prefer to be in their position than in our position, so in the end it’s up to us to keep winning everything but they obviously have the advantage because they are on top</p>

They didn’t give a chance - the same way we didn’t give anybody a chance last year. Congratulations to them, and next season we must make sure we come back stronger than ever</p>

  <p><b>[Cesc Fabregas wants to get one over on Jose Mourinho when Chelsea face Manchester United in the FA Cup final]</b> No, especially in the last two years, we played many games against them and he has changed the system many times. I am sure he will change something again on Saturday. I love him. I always say that. I owe him a lot because he brought me here, I will always remember that. My first year here, Arsene <b>[Wenger]</b> had always treated me like a son, but the closest anyone has been to him was Jose. The way he treated me, the way he made me feel, how he let me be a leader of the team from day one. This was fantastic and in all the four years since I joined Chelsea, that will always stay with me. It <b>[this experience]</b> is thanks to him. Our history of what happened between us - I played for Arsenal and him at Chelsea, Barcelona and him with Real Madrid. We were confronting each other, but then we humbled ourselves and started a good relationship. This is very nice but hopefully it will not be his day and Chelsea can win. I was happy at Barcelona but there were players who were there for many years before me. For me, it was different because I went and came back and they paid money for me. It is more difficult, I never had the same love that the other players had. That’s also because they were such fantastic players, don’t get me wrong! When he brought me here, I had a lot of fire inside of me. It was a fantastic year <b>[with him]</b>, to be honest.<br /><br />Well, it is not easy after how we ended the season on Sunday on a very negative day, but listen, there’s no other way than to pick ourselves up. Today is maybe a quiet day, but we have to pick ourselves up, stand up and focus on Saturday to try to win this one for the fans. When you play the cup final, you can win a treble, but you still want to win in everything. It is about the passion you have inside, if you don’t have it, you don’t have it. But I think if you really want to win and they are telling you that you are playing a cup final on the last day of the season against Manchester United, you don’t need someone to tell you to play well. It is inside each one of us, this fire and hunger to go and beat them. We want to get the cup for the fans and ourselves. I never believe in these things <b>[about one team being the favourite]</b>. The cup final is one game and anything can happen, really. Last year everyone was saying Chelsea will win it and we played one of our worst games of last season. So anything can happen. We always know it will be a tough game. Mourinho prepares for finals very, very well and I am sure Antonio will do the same<br /><br />We played well in the first half and in one moment they scored what was a good goal, to be honest. In the second half, it was not good and we tried to change things around but maybe it was a little bit too late. I think it is those moments that we sometimes lacked this season. Sometimes we need to finish the game off, not to give opportunities to other games to come back. This is an example of what this year, we could have done better</p>

In the Champions League, you play against Barcelona, they are one of the top teams in the world. You can win, you can lose. That can happen. In the FA Cup, we have done well. In the league, it is a little bit where we should have done better, we were not consistent enough in our performances and there is no explanation why one day we can be very good, one day after we are just not good enough. This is on us as players. We should have put it right when we had the chance to do it. We didn’t and we paid for it.

Of course, I know when we talk in 20 or 30 years, if you win the World Cup, the future generations who do not watch him now will be even more clear on the fact Leo was the best because they can say ‘he won a World Cup’. But people who have played with him or know about football will tell you he is the best and the most complete player ever. Cristiano is fantastic and everyone admires him for what he does, the guy is a competitor. But talent-wise and when we talk about the complete player, Leo became the best goalscorer ever, became the best passer ever, he can score with both feet, his head, he can dribble around four players. He has vision to make assists, he is the most complete ever, no doubt.<br /><br />People want to put Leo up against Cristiano and of course they both need each other to make themselves better, but we are talking about different teams, different groups, different moments. I think they just respect each other and get on with it. It’s been going on too long for either of them to get annoyed by it.</p>

But, so far, from what I can say right now, yes I will stay here until the end of the season. I will play in the Premier League now. In December I will play games. I already know which games I will play and I am ready for it. I have spoken to the coach. He has been straight-forward with me and I need to be ready for when the opportunity comes. That’s it.<br /><br />This was another opportunity for the rest of the team. The whole side changed except Kepa, so probably the same will happen in Hungary against Vidi. We have to take our chances. At the moment this is the only platform for us to show what we can do, we have to take it and that’s what we did. That’s the problem with the Europa League to be honest. You saw that with Arsenal - I think two players travelled <b>[to Ukraine]</b> from the squad that will play on Sunday. It’s a tricky competition, you play every Thursday and Sunday. We knew it was going to be a difficult season because of that. We just have to be ready. 10 players played on Saturday, 10 on Thursday. That means you have 20 players who can play at the top level and that is positive. I would rather be on the other side of the team, but I play at Stamford Bridge, I’m happy. That’s the most important thing. But, of course, every player wants to play more. He made that clear to be honest. I have known that since the beginning of the season. I know that <b>[Sarri]</b> rates me highly but at the same time it’s a new position for me and I think it is just my fifth game starting in it. I only played there when I was 10 or 12 in the academy at Barcelona. It is something new to learn. At the same time, I can give more in other positions. Maybe at the moment, he still doesn’t see it. We have had a chat about it and maybe in the future it will start to happen. But at the moment it is what it is and you just have to take it.<br /><br /><b>[Fabregas said of Jorginho]</b> He is a good player, he knows the system very well, he plays one touch, makes short passes. But it has been difficult for him because opponents know how to defend against this. Maybe whether he plays, or I play, sometimes we have to find a solution, new movement, be quicker with the ball. But it’s not easy when you play in this position because you can’t move too much. If you move too much to get an option on the ball, then you leave too much freedom in there. For the opponent, it is probably the easiest position to man mark. You can’t really get away from the play, you need to stay there. Even if you don’t touch the ball, you have to stay just in case there is a lost ball or something like that. In terms of if you want to put in a man-marking player, this is the easiest player to mark. But we know what we have to do, we know what the coach wants from us, we just have to keep going<br /><br /><b>[Fulham are next for Chelsea]</b> It’s massive. Fulham played well the other day, they won and have a new manager. There is new motivation for the players and it will be a tough game. It is an early kick-off too so we need to be ready for it</p>

He has been at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - and I don’t want people to think I am being critical of the club here - but I think it is time that Eden leaves and tries something else. I know he always says he doesn’t care about the Ballon d’Or, but deep down it is something that I think every player feels would be a nice thing. I think I believe more than he does that he can win the Ballon d’Or, definitely. I know his ability. I know what he can do. I have played with the very best. I know that the talent is there. Now this year he has scored a lot of goals as well. He got a lot of assists, his link up is great. He has got everything in his locker to be the best. That’s why I want him to be the best. That’s why I think he deserves a team at his right level to allow him to be the best.<br /><br />I think at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he could never win it.

I think that at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> that Eden would win everything. He would kill it. He would be brilliant. I have no doubts. He is 28 - it is his last chance to have this. It is now or never. The other option is to stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, which could be a great move for him but only if he really wants it, is happy and he believes in the future of the team.

I think the teams that make it from the beginning to the end of the Europa League normally means that they will play a lot of games during the season. It is a really long competition, it starts really early and finishes really late. There is always more games than the Champions League even. It is really tough, not necessarily because of the opponents but because of travelling. Especially because England is a really demanding league where you have the <b>[Carabao]</b> Cup on top of it. I was part of the team, played in practically all the group stage and captained the team two times. Even if I didn’t get a medal, I don’t care. However you want to look at it is fine, but I did feel part of it.<br /><br />I don’t even know where all my medals are so it isn’t something I care about much. It has been a really demanding season for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as well. They are one of the teams that has played the most games in Europe this season. That tells you a lot. That’s why I think that both teams in a way deserved in their own way to make it. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> did their job also reaching the Champions League. For <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it was the game of the season. They played for everything in one night.

In football today, you could lose two games and be sacked the next day. That’s why coaches are sometimes hesitant to make changes or trust someone who doesn’t have the experience or is too young.
