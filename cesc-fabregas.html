I remember in the Netherlands game, which we lost 5-1, we were winning 1-0 and <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> was one-on-one with the goalkeeper. If he scored that it would have been 2-0, and no chance for them. We’d have probably won and the confidence would have been very different.

If not there’s so many questions surrounding the club.<br /><br /><b>[Fabregas went on to suggest that the persistently negative press coverage was taking the shine off what has been a good season]</b> The press talk and talk and talk. There’s so much negativity surrounding the club and it should always be positivity. For example, tonight, they’re playing in a European final and we’re talking about negativity. We should be talking about the season they’ve had, qualifying for the Champions League, and being in two cup finals, tonight they could win one. Something has to change for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Cesc Fabregas has urged former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> to move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> It is a difficult situation and a difficult opinion for me to have. He has been at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - and I don’t want people to think I am being critical of the club here - but I think it is time that Eden leaves and tries something else. I know he always says he doesn’t care about the Ballon d’Or, but deep down it is something that I think every player feels would be a nice thing. I think I believe more than he does that he can win the Ballon d’Or, definitely. I know his ability. I know what he can do. I have played with the very best. I know that the talent is there. Now this year he has scored a lot of goals as well. He got a lot of assists, his link up is great. He has got everything in his locker to be the best. That’s why I want him to be the best. That’s why I think he deserves a team at his right level to allow him to be the best.<br /><br />I think at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he could never win it. Not because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is not good enough or anything like that but there are teams and clubs that are so big with their image around the world that it makes a big difference. I think that at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> that Eden would win everything. He would kill it. He would be brilliant. I have no doubts. He is 28 - it is his last chance to have this. It is now or never. The other option is to stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, which could be a great move for him but only if he really wants it, is happy and he believes in the future of the team. That’s the other thing. After seven years of winning a lot at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I think it is time to try something else.<br /><br /><b>[Fabregas believes that the European triumph was a major achievement]</b> It has been a long season. I think the teams that make it from the beginning to the end of the Europa League normally means that they will play a lot of games during the season. It is a really long competition, it starts really early and finishes really late. There is always more games than the Champions League even. It is really tough, not necessarily because of the opponents but because of travelling. Especially because England is a really demanding league where you have the <b>[Carabao]</b> Cup on top of it. I was part of the team, played in practically all the group stage and captained the team two times. Even if I didn’t get a medal, I don’t care. However you want to look at it is fine, but I did feel part of it.<br /><br />I don’t even know where all my medals are so it isn’t something I care about much. It has been a really demanding season for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as well. They are one of the teams that has played the most games in Europe this season. That tells you a lot. That’s why I think that both teams in a way deserved in their own way to make it. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> did their job also reaching the Champions League. For <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it was the game of the season. They played for everything in one night. It was a more important game for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> than <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.</p>

In football today, you could lose two games and be sacked the next day. That’s why coaches are sometimes hesitant to make changes or trust someone who doesn’t have the experience or is too young. They can look good in training but then in a game situation, they could freeze or make a mistake. The mistake could be in their head in the future if they aren’t strong enough. I don’t blame coaches too much. I know it is very difficult. Callum has taken it all very well. He kept working, he took it with a smile on his face and in the end, <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> and the whole world knew he deserved to play..<br /><br /><b>[Fabregas recalls first seeing <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> break through with the club]</b> He is a good boy who is full of confidence.

His finishing was superb. I thought, I have never seen this kid before but actually he has something about him. It was very early and only the first day but you could definitely see something. Then the more he trained with us you could see that he was getting more confident. He was taking people on in training and he was not afraid. You could see that he had a lot of potential. Slowly, slowly he grew up. He played a little bit more and in the end, there was nothing else that <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> could do but play him.

Although I completely understand the meaning behind it and it’s better to be safe in all accounts, because the most important is the families and the health security of everyone and support this 100 per cent. But maybe we could’ve considered individual training, where you have basically no risk. You’re not touching anyone, you’re not close to anyone. See if everyone was getting closer to football behind played all over the world. Obviously, it’s very difficult and I understand someone needs to make decisions. We just have to do what they’re telling us. Difficult moment in our professional lives and personal lives, but we just have to hold on and everything will be fine in the future for sure.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabregas reveals continued Gunners affinity despite <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> move]</b> I am and it will be part of me for the rest of my life. I would never have thought I would have mixed feelings between these two teams, but you go there and you meet people, you win titles, become important and win titles. You end up having so much love for the club. You are right. You don’t forget where you come from and I came from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> academy and I will never forget that, but to make it on the biggest level was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I don’t forget that. I was so lucky to come in at that moment, to see you, Ashley (Cole), Robert (Pires), Patrick (Vieira), Sol (Campbell). The management at the club gave me so much leadership and everything I needed to be a top player. I will never deny that I will always be an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man in my heart. Football has so many turnarounds but I will never forget the connection with the fans and I had so much love at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. No can ever hear me say anything bad about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, even when I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and won there, and then won the league</p>

  <p><b>[Fabregas reveals <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> tried to sign him at 15]</b> I was 15. I was the captain of that team. I was well valued. On top of me there was <b>[Andres]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, other players that you could see they had the potential to make it. One day a scout from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> came to talk to my parents and he wanted to discuss a few things with me. I always like to listen. After you make up your own mind but just out of respect <b>[I like to listen]</b>. We did that and the guy told me he’d been to see me over 50 times. He said I was made to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He started showing me everything he studied from my game, he called <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> to take me to London Colney and <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> to make me an offer and show me the training ground. At that time I had <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> as well. I was supposed to make two trips, London and Manchester, and when I went to London Colney, in the middle of June, everyone was on holiday. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was in Paris. He flew by private jet to meet me. <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> (then <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> vice-chairman) came to meet me. This shocked me. Wow… <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>. I’m 15 years old, I’m absolutely nobody, and this guy is breaking up his holiday to come and meet me. We were talking, he spoke to my mother, showed me the training ground. I fell in love with the whole project<br /><br />It was a bit of everything. I always felt that we were competing against the world. Let’s say you guys (Manchester United), <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, sometimes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I speak to guys at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and my Spanish friends at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and everyone tells me the same … ‘we used to hate playing against you guys’. And I say the same: ‘Yeah, you used to hate it, but we always lost’. Especially in important moments. I always felt so frustrated to see these big teams winning and always having that edge. I was very young, I was very passionate. I gave absolutely everything for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I was hungry. I wanted to win. I was a competitor. I would’ve done anything to win for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I felt this wasn’t coming. We had opportunities to sign big players that would make such a big difference but for one little thing or another, very small details they were looking away. A lot of things frustrated me and I just decided to go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. They were the best team in the world at that time. With all my friends there. I took the chance but earlier than I would’ve wanted. I just felt it was the right time. My brain was a little bit gone. Deep down, thinking now, I think I should’ve waited two more years</p>

  <p><b>[Cesc Fabregas has revealed his frustration at the manner in which <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> ended <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s 49-game unbeaten run back in 2004]</b> We were so disappointed. We were angry, we were upset. It had to come to an end, the 49 games, it can happen at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> against a great <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> side. But I think it’s the way it happened. First of all, <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a>, what he did to Antonio Reyes … mamma mia! But every single time he had the ball! Wayne <b>[<a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>]</b> dived for the penalty against Sol <b>[Campbell]</b>. The emotion was that we had lost against a great team, which can happen, but we didn’t feel we should’ve lost. We didn’t feel it was the right time to lose our invincible run. Everyone was really, really upset</p>

  <p><b>[What <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> told Fabregas to convince him to join <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Jose has one system but he works on that system very well. He’s got the specific players for the right system. One day, when I first met him he told me ‘I need two players, I’m going to sign <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>. If you come to me…’, he drew me the team on paper and said ‘this team is winning the title’. The first day I met him he said ‘I only need two players: Diego, who is basically signed’ and then <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> was coming but if not it was <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>. It’s basically the same. But he said: ‘you come, we will win the title’. After that, working with him, he’s probably the coach that played with my mind better. He’s a great coach for great players. He plays with the mind. He stimulates you. One day, we were doing very well in the league and he texts to tell you how good you are, how you played so well … <b>[but then]</b> ‘today you were rubbish’. Like this, he plays with you<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on his time with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> It was fantastic. It couldn’t be any better. If you asked me when I was 23, captain of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, that I could be so happy to have played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> over the years and being so happy there and having won what we won, I would’ve said that you’re crazy. But my understanding with the fans, with the club, with everyone that works there and the players, I was so happy. I felt that I fit in so well. We had some great coaches, again you could see that’s it a club that wants to win. That it’s hungry for titles. You need to compete always until the end to win. That’s what I wanted. I knew going with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> could be a big step forward in my career</p>
