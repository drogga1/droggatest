  <p><b>[Rose Lavelle on team-mate and USA midfielder Andi Sullivan]</b> I think of the best player as someone who is well rounded, and that’s Sunny. If there were ten replica Sunnys, it would be the best team in the world. She’s so versatile, but so good at each position that she plays. She’s just so composed on the ball, so smart</p>

  <p><b>[Rose Lavelle denied that she dove to win her team’s second penalty kick against Spain, which led to the game-winning goal. After the game though, Lavelle maintained that she was fouled despite seemingly minimal contact]</b> I got a little kick in the shin and she called it. I did get kicked, I didn’t flop so I figured if she saw the contact then it would be a foul.</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. women’s national team midfielder Rose Lavelle has declared herself fit ahead of Sunday’s World Cup final against Netherlands]</b> I’m good, I’m ready to go. I just didn’t want to be a liability on the field because I do know with muscles anything can happen so it was a little bit more precautionary.<br /><br /><b>[Lavelle admitted that after a yearlong ordeal that saw her suffer multiple setbacks, she does have extra concern over any potential hamstring injury]</b> It’s something that I’m always paranoid about but I’ll be fine<br /><br /><b>[Though the USWNT are strongly favored to repeat as World Cup winners, Lavelle is expecting a difficult game on Sunday against the European champions]</b> Netherlands is a great team and they are at the top of their game right now. We don’t take them lightly at all. I think it’s going to be tooth-and-nail, a close game</p>

We know we have to come out 100 percent and we can’t sit back because we know that every team we’ve played has been capable of doing the same thing. We’ve just started on the front foot and obviously it’s worked out.</p>

  <p><b>[Rose Lavelle solidified her status as the breakout star of the World Cup for the U.S. women’s national team on Sunday, and her rapid rise has surprised even her]</b> I felt like over the course of the game it was hard to find that kind of space, they were sitting in a little bit. So finally when there was an opportunity to take space I decided to go for it and thankfully it worked out for me<br /><br />Oh my god I freaking lost it! It was insane. I knew it was going in when she was driving with the ball. She just does things casually that are just out of this world, it’s ridiculous</p>

Hopefully little Rose Lavelle will come up and everyone will forget about old Rose Lavelle.</p>

I feel it’s cool that it’s come full circle and now can serve as the same kind of role model to younger kids as they did to me. Hopefully I can inspire some kids to get to this place too</p>

  <p><b>[How USWNT ace Lavelle went from depths of despair to on top of the world]</b> I expected when it was all over to be so emotional and crying from happiness and all that. and I was just kind of like, ‘We did it. Cool.’<br /><br /><b>[But that version of Lavelle was replaced with a timid, fragile player who was afraid to make mistakes - a death knell for any creative player]</b> I came back and I was just awful. I wasn’t having fun and I wasn’t enjoying it. My whole life playing soccer I’ve never felt so uncomfortable on the ball. Before <b>[the injury]</b>, it was just like everything was innate. It was natural and I just did what I saw and played what I felt like was on. Then, I came back from my injury and I felt like I was overthinking everything. For how physically hard it was to come back, it was 10 times harder mentally<br /><br />There were a lot of ups and downs. But then, I think those ups and downs prepared me more for adversity and made me better<br /><br /><b>[Midway through the second half against England - a game in which she was at her free-flowing peak - Lavelle went down with an injury]</b> I remember looking at <b>[head coach]</b> Jill <b>[Ellis]</b> and being like, ‘I need a sub now’. After that game, like two days before the World Cup final, I didn’t think I was going to be able to play at all. Especially with the history of my hamstring, it’s so unpredictable. I remember the practice two days before. I was just like, ‘I don’t think I’m going to be able to <b>[play]</b> because I’m scared to sprint right now<br /><br /><b>[Then something inexplicable happened. With time quickly running out, Lavelle’s hamstring problem evaporated]</b> I honestly have no idea what happened because my hamstring felt great. I have no clue. I have no explanation for it<br /><br />You just have to constantly be on your A-game because you don’t want to say something that’s going to be misconstrued. <b>[The team’s veterans]</b> did that so well during the World Cup and made it so that everyone else didn’t have to worry about it. I remember going into press conferences and media stuff, I’d always be so scared of getting asked those questions but I don’t think I ever ended up getting asked a lot of those questions, because those got directed more towards the older players<br /><br /><b>[Though she was reluctant to play that role in France, Lavelle knows she could be called upon to be a more prominent voice in the coming years]</b> I always think when I hear <b>[the team’s veterans]</b> speaking just how smart they are and how much they know. It makes me realize how much I still need to learn. Being in that position has made me realize that I need to hold myself accountable and make myself learn and know as much as possible, so that if I ever am in that same situation I can hold myself the same way that they do<br /><br />During the World Cup, it was so stressful, so when the whistle blew we could finally just take a breath and enjoy the moment. In that moment, it was just our time to celebrate and be with each other. That was probably why I was just more like, ‘I can breathe again</p>
