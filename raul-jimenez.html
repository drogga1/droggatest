Edson Alvarez, Andres Guardado and Raul Jimenez were all named to Mexico’s starting lineup for El Tri’s final Gold Cup group stage match. Gerardo Martino’s side will take on Martinique in Charlotte on Sunday night</p>

  <p><b>[Raul Jimenez can score goals. He can help set things up. He can track back to attack. And he is committed to the cause. Can Raul Jimenez step up for Mexico in final Gold Cup matches?]</b> There’s something in which I have no doubts: I like to play and train with the national team. It’s tough with the travel, the adaptation and being tired, although the pride it leaves is much bigger. The Mexican national team, and the fame it gives you, is a prize and you have to know how to live with that. It’s true that in Mexico it’s not possible to have a private life as a player, but to wear the green continues to be the big dream.</p>

  <p><b>[Gold Cup final just one step in Martino’s plan for Mexico]</b> Well, tomorrow I think all we want is to win. To have the cup at the end of the game. We’re in good form. We’re recovered now from the other two games and we know what we’re playing for. At the end, we want to win</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he could move for nine figures]</b> For a Mexican player, or for a Mexican, it would be almost impossible, perhaps because of the kind of mentality in Mexico. It will be said that ‘he is not so good’, whether ‘he is worth it’. But if someone pays that amount of money for someone it is because he is worth it. Sometimes the amounts are stratospheric but I think football has changed a lot, and it can be achieved. For me it would be an extra motivation to know that I have to give more of myself, back up what they are paying for you and continue giving things to talk about. It doesn’t scare me. Football is something I’ve always dreamed of, it has always been my life. Therefore, if it happens, it would be an important motivation to carry out such a transfer<br /><br />The important thing is to move forward. I am very good at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, but you always have to look for more, you have to keep fighting. Now we are in sixth place in the table. The other day, I was talking with my dad and he said: ‘If some of the top-six teams wanted to sign you, where would you go?’. I said: ‘But now I’m in sixth!’ I am above several teams that are considered ‘top six’. I’m great here. Then, it would be to see what the conditions are, if it suits me, if it suits <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and the other team<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether he would rule out such a switch]</b> No, never. I had a good experience there and I would like to go back at some point and try things again in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. It is not something to rule out</p>

It will be a tough game, but we know that. It’s never easy to come back from two goals, especially against a team like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. It’s difficult, but with our heart and our football, we knew this was a very good opportunity for us to win this game. It wasn’t a perfect match, but we played very well against a very good team in <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. It’s difficult to win or even draw against them, but we’ve won both games. So, we are very excited, very happy, and we will enjoy this</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves star Jimenez: I don’t regret <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> move]</b> It was difficult at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. It was my first experience in Europe when I went there and <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> was hard. But I learnt a lot there, a lot of things I am now making on the pitch. So everything counts. I have no regrets about going there because it was a very good experience. Now I want to keep learning, keep improving and keep doing what I have been doing for the team. At <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> we are growing and I hope we can have a good season<br /><br />Of course I also watched <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> and what he made at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was great. He didn’t have the minutes maybe that he wanted, but he did well whenever he entered the pitch. He did his best, gave 100 percent, and I think he did well in the time he was there. Of course I hope I can do better here</p>

It’s a dream that I’d like to fulfil again and I’d be one of the team’s reinforcement men. First I have to wait and then, if there’s a call, talk to the club</p>

Here I am, making my dreams come true<br /><br /><b>[Jimenez said of a proposed move to Asia]</b> It was difficult because it was for a lot of millions. But I knew it was not the time to make that decision to - I can say it - almost end my career. It is not the same being in China as being in Europe. I think that I made the right choice. I never quit. I always kept working and doing the things that I know with a smile on my face knowing that if my chance came I would be ready to take it. Now I am in a good moment<br /><br /><b>[He added on his ambition and a previous one-season stint in Spain]</b> It was always a dream as a footballer to compete in the best leagues in the world and those leagues are here in Europe. You want to compete against the best players and that year <b>[2014-15]</b> at Atletico helped me a lot to become what I am now. It was difficult because it was the first time I was living alone but I think I adapted quickly to a new life. I learned that I had to be patient and I had work hard even if the opportunities were not there. I just had to keep working to find them</p>

  <p><b>[Raul Jimenez has reacted to the transfer talk that continues to swirl around him]</b> I have a contract until 2023. It’s not that we have to qualify for the Champions League in order to stay. I’m good <b>[here]</b>, happy with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, doing important things - me as well as the whole team. We’ve been trying our best since the start of last season. We’ve qualified for the Europa League, now we’re fighting for a Champions League spot. And it’s the big motivation to keep growing as a player and getting into the Champions League is always a plus that satisfies you and keeps you thinking about big things<br /><br />In 10 years I will be 39 so, I don’t know, I may be retired. I hope to last as long as I can. I have been a player with few injuries and I hope to continue for many more years. I then want to be a coach or take a position on TV, but I will continue in football. I am having a good time in Europe for now but in the future I don’t rule out going back to America</p>

We know that we can do it. We can fight for it and I don’t think we’re going to be disappointed if we don’t do it but now that we see that we can do it. It’s incredible to be part of this team, part of this family, we are all working hard to achieve our goal and I’m really enjoying playing with my team-mates. Every one of us adds his little piece to what we are doing. I was really enjoying the season, I know it’s not finished yet and we know that we have to keep fighting for the places that we want</p>

I realised that the football was faster, it took hard work but after everything I’ve been through, it worked and now I am where I am because I haven’t given up<br /><br /><b>[Jimenez is proud that he has become such a pivotal player for <a href="nuno-espirito-santo.html">Nuno Espirito Santo</a>’s team]</b> I would have liked to have been more important at Atletico or at <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, but now I am the important player that my team-mates, the club and the fans need, and what I have done is paying off</p>

He’s very happy at his club, hopefully getting into positions for Champions League and Europa League at the moment. Always for him, all of that will be very gratifying, very cool to hear those comments. Right now is the time of rumours, God willing the league hopefully resumes next month and that’s where we are right now. The rest, there is nothing. He’s only commented on what he sees that they publish, but nothing at the moment. Later, if there is something different, we will see.

It is an incredible thing to be on the radar and on the lips of those teams. It is something good for me to continue growing, making an effort and taking it as an incentive so that, if possible, I can achieve it. My dream team? Whatever one that signs me would be incredible. Imagine that right now I tell you one and in the end I go to the rival, they will reproach me all the time, I will get into trouble!<br /><br />There has always been speculation since I’ve got here about our team. But we don’t think about it. We want to be together for as much time as we can but it’s football, the speculation will always be there.
