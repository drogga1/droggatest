He’s played an extensive amount of games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, as well as playing in the Europa League and his experience will also help benefit the other keepers in the squad</p>

He has shown his quality in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and his progression has been a steady and consistent one. He’s improved with every season, and on the back of an impressive first season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> he continues to progress; I’m delighted he has now been given recognition at international level</p>

  <p><b>[Hughton believes Walker should have been sent off]</b> In my opinion, it was a red card. We ask players to be honest and Alireza doesn’t make a big meal of it. If I look at the action, which I have done, there would have been numerous circumstances where that exact same action would have got somebody a red card. I think there was sufficient force in the action to warrant that<br /><br /><b>[On the use of VAR in the semi-final]</b> I think we’re at the stage now where everybody is pushing for it. I’m probably one that has been converted a little bit. I’m still not sure how far it’s going to take us. I’m even more disappointed that this was with VAR. Everybody will have a different opinion and I’m only giving you my opinion - I’ve seen it on three or four occasions<br /><br /><b>[Besides the first-half controversy, though, Hughton was proud of a Brighton display]</b> I know <b>[City]</b> had half-chances with the quality they’ve got, but I’m struggling to think of a clear chance - I don’t think that has happened to them many times this season<br /><br />Particularly after going behind so early in the game, I can’t imagine that there were too many in the stadium that didn’t think that a second and a third was coming.<br /><br />We regrouped and came into what I thought - for our level and for what we are - was a really good game. We had chances. The majority of them were from set plays, but we were forceful enough to get them.</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> I can remember Frank as a young player, he went to school quite close to the old <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> training ground and was the type of player that all of us, as coaches, admired. He improved every year of his career and that’s because of the hard work he was prepared to put in, he ended up being one of the best box-to-box midfielders that this country has ever produced.<br /><br />As a manager, you never know how it will go - you may feel someone has all the right credentials and that they’ve done everything right in terms of earning their qualifications, but you can never be sure. He’s played in many club sides and he would have picked up a lot, but until the opportunity arises you don’t know. He’s mixed youth and experience at Derby and has them playing in a certain way - they’ve had some real success so far.</p>

Despite avoiding relegation, Brighton enter the 2019-20 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season with a new manager, having parted ways with Chris Hughton. Former <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea City</a> boss <a href="graham-potter.html">Graham Potter</a> will take charge of the Seagulls in what is his first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> gig and the aim will to be to improve on a 17th-place finish</p>

But it’s about the result and how you get the result. You’ll have one extremely happy changing room, and one extremely disappointed one. We’ve seen them in the past, but that wasn’t a masterclass</p>

But certainly if I look at the points they are on at this moment, and without any of the top six in the coming games, there is an opportunity for them.
