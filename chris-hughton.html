He is a highly-rated young full-back, by both Chelsea and England; he is predominantly a right-back, but he can play in any position across the back four, and will give us good defensive cover for the first-team for the second half of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho has a wonderful way of dealing with pressure]</b> Jose has managed at some big, big clubs, and at all of those clubs, there is pressure, it comes with the territory. But he has a wonderful way of dealing with that pressure, and when you manage these sorts of clubs, you’ve got to be used to that. You’ll never get anyone saying something detrimental about Jose - he’s an outstanding manager. Whenever I’ve been in his presence, he’s always been very good company. He’s always spoke really well about us when we’ve played here.</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton’s win against Manchester United on Friday night was only their ninth in 36 matches this season]</b> I think we recruited really well in the summer. We not only brought in what I regarded as good players, we brought in good individuals as well. I think that gave us a platform to build on.<br /><br />What we do have in our game in England is an imbalance. There is a high percentage of black and ethnic players playing but a huge imbalance of those going into management. What we have seen certainly in recent years are great developments at grassroots level and academy level and under 23 level. But that step up into senior football, first-team football and jobs in other aspects of our game has been far more difficult. So in any way that I can help persuade, encourage or be any type of role model for somebody that wants to get into management then it’s something I’m very proud and honoured to do<br /><br />When I went into the club I was very definite about the way that I wanted to play and what I wanted from the team. But at that time what we had to do was we had to recruit well. When I first went in the priority was to just to make sure that we stayed in the league<br /><br />Probably the biggest plus for the group of players that we had was we missed out on promotion in my first full season and sometimes that can knock a squad. I think it made them stronger and the way they’ve adapted to the Premier League has been outstanding<br /><br />You’ve seen where they started and the confidence they now have and that is because of the stability that they’ve got there. They’re comfortable in the division and they are winning games and players are playing at a better level than they have done. I think we’ve managed to do something like that at Brighton</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton boss Chris Hughton has named Kevin De Bruyne a more complete player than Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah]</b> For me, De Bruyne’s the more complete player and I think it’s taken an exceptional season from Salah to win the awards ahead of De Bruyne. The progress that De Bruyne has made in the last couple of seasons has been huge and the player that I think could play for any team in the world. But Salah’s been exceptional and I think it would be probably so unusual and unjust to take it away from him. To score that many goals in one season in the way that the game is now and how competitive the game is now, I think speaks volumes for the way Liverpool play and for him as an individual. But for me, De Bruyne is the most complete player.</p>

  <p><b>[How three promoted clubs defied the odds to stay up]</b> I think that teams coming up are maybe a little better prepared, for starters. Even financially, I think we broke our transfer record four times last summer, Huddersfield might have done it four or five times too, and Newcastle spent big more so the season before. So that helps teams prepare better than in the past.<br /><br />On a good day everybody can beat everybody. I think that’s what it’s down to. That group outside of the top six has been bigger this season, and I think that’s helped the promoted clubs</p>

I think he showed that in the summer, I think he’s showed that in good periods at United. I think he’s a wonderful athlete, can certainly break very, very well from midfield and I think what he has shown is a passing ability that he’s got. He’s a wonderful all-round footballer.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City vs Brighton]</b> Along with playing Liverpool away, I would say that this is the toughest game. We did okay in the Liverpool one and might’ve got a result there, so you always have to be positive going into games like this. No-one expects us to get anything from it, so that’s normal and that pressure is taken off, but we want to do as well as we can. Irrespective of the different levels between the two teams and their qualities, there isn’t ever any game we go into thinking that we’re going to get beaten. You have to look at the good examples of our performances against the big teams away from home.</p>

He’s improved with every season, and on the back of an impressive first season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> he continues to progress; I’m delighted he has now been given recognition at international level</p>

It was tough to come in at the break 1-0 down but it’s about making sure you take your chances.<br /><br />These are the types of games we have worked incredibly hard to be involved in. When they come about you can’t fear them. It’s very difficult as manager to look forward to those type of games, because you know the magnitude of them, but we have proved we can get a result in any game. They are the challenges we have and we’ll continue to have those challenges</p>

It’s a big point <b>[Arsenal]</b> and a point that we needed. We’d had three defeats on the spin. I think we can gain something from the performance as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton manager Chris Hughton has offered Neil Warnock his sympathies after the Cardiff boss saw his team lose to Chelsea]</b> I can certainly understand Neil’s frustration after a game where there were some decisions that went against his team. I can understand his feelings and his emotions. We are also a team that has been on the end of some poor decisions that have gone against us, but that’s part and parcel of the games. I certainly feel that we have a good overall standard of refereeing here but VAR will come in next season and I think that will change the game. At the moment, though, there are still going to be decisions that are going to be tough to take, particularly with the number of cameras now that we have at stadiums and the amount of footage that’s being shown.<br /><br />I suppose the first priority for us is to make sure that our own results are good enough, that we don’t have to rely on others. But as soon as our result is finished you want the other teams around you to have not done well. We are amongst a group of teams that are fighting every game and we’ve got to be fighting, if anything, harder than the rest of them</p>

If I look at the action, which I have done, there would have been numerous circumstances where that exact same action would have got somebody a red card. I think there was sufficient force in the action to warrant that<br /><br /><b>[On the use of VAR in the semi-final]</b> I think we’re at the stage now where everybody is pushing for it. I’m probably one that has been converted a little bit. I’m still not sure how far it’s going to take us. I’m even more disappointed that this was with VAR. Everybody will have a different opinion and I’m only giving you my opinion - I’ve seen it on three or four occasions<br /><br /><b>[Besides the first-half controversy, though, Hughton was proud of a Brighton display]</b> I know <b>[City]</b> had half-chances with the quality they’ve got, but I’m struggling to think of a clear chance - I don’t think that has happened to them many times this season<br /><br />Particularly after going behind so early in the game, I can’t imagine that there were too many in the stadium that didn’t think that a second and a third was coming.<br /><br />We regrouped and came into what I thought - for our level and for what we are - was a really good game. We had chances. The majority of them were from set plays, but we were forceful enough to get them.</p>

There was a lot wrong and the players will have to make amends for it, we’re at home - the weekend was disappointing, but the crowd have been fantastic for us and I’m sure they will be again on Tuesday.<br /><br />We will have to keep our heads, it will be a very competitive game.

He improved every year of his career and that’s because of the hard work he was prepared to put in, he ended up being one of the best box-to-box midfielders that this country has ever produced.<br /><br />As a manager, you never know how it will go - you may feel someone has all the right credentials and that they’ve done everything right in terms of earning their qualifications, but you can never be sure. He’s played in many club sides and he would have picked up a lot, but until the opportunity arises you don’t know. He’s mixed youth and experience at Derby and has them playing in a certain way - they’ve had some real success so far.</p>
