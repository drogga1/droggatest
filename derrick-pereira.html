  <p>[Visitors Minerva Punjab downed Churchill Brothers 5-4] We need to reinforce the team. I’m going to talk to Churchill Alemao as he’s planning to get the fourth foreigner and one or two Indian players. We have to improve on the fitness and understanding between players. ‘I would opt for an attacking midfielder and somebody in the defence.</p>

  <p>[Churchill Brothers put up a fine display on Sunday evening to register a 3-0 win over DSK Shivajians at the Tilak Maidan] It was a much needed win. The boys responded well and we were well organised in defence. We created good chances in the first half and scored excellent goals in the second half. Very pleased with the players’ response and we will try to do better. A win is always a win. The next match is against Mohun Bagan, so it will be the same if we win against them as well. We only do our 100 percent and get what we deserve.<br /><br />I felt [Priyant] was a little low on confidence after the last match. I know Naveen from Salgaocar and I thought he would be better as he comes out for crosses as DSK play long and put in a lot of crosses. He gave a lot of confidence to the defence. Bektur and Richard complement each other. They can improve going forward, but as far as ball holding is concerned, they are good. Wolfe and Brandon did very well with the ball, Kromah as well. Chesterpoul was deployed on the right because we knew that Quero is a threat and Chester is much quicker<br /><br />We got three points and we now look forward to the Mohun Bagan match. We will try to put pressure on them as we have got six days to prepare</p>

  <p>[Churchill Brothers’s Derrick Pereira - Win over Mohun Bagan will help us] It’s a very good win for us. The players worked very hard to get these three points. There were a few moments where we lost focus in defence when we conceded the goal. Sony Norde was left free and we conceded from that. We’ll play to win each and every match. We have to go with that positive attitude and this result will definitely help us in the future matches.<br /><br />We wanted to make a change before we equalised. But then when we equalised, we organised our midfield by keeping Bektur [Talgat] and Richard [Costa] at the back since one point was better than none. I didn’t want to disturb the shape of the team. We expected them to play long balls when they were on the lookout for an equaliser. That’s the reason we kept Bektur and Richard to win the second ball</p>
