  <p><b>[Aleksandr Krestinin, the head coach of Kyrgyzstan football team spoke to the press ahead of his team’s crucial Asian Cup qualifier against India]</b> e will aim for victory tomorrow. We are ready and we know what we need to do tomorrow. Our main goal is to qualify for the first place. We have information about India and their preparation and conditions. I think they also have information about us. This is 21st century and there are no secrets. We are ready to play.<br /><br /> haven’t played many games to prepare. Our players play in Europe and in Kyrgyzstan, all players in good conditions. We don’t need to make some big preparation for this game. We know India is a strong side with good physical condition and good in defence. They are very strong at home. We will not be satisfied with a draw. We came here only for victory</p>

  <p><b>[Kyrgyzstan coach says ‘it was not difficult’ to defend Indian attack, laments poor finishing]</b> We tried to do our best, continued to pressure but we couldn’t finish our chances. Yes, <b>[the substituition]</b> changed our game. In the opening minutes, it is difficult to recover after making an early change. <b>[We]</b> will go to see in the hospital what happened to him.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the defeat, Kyrgyzstan coach said that holding off the Indian attack wasn’t difficult]</b> Yes, we missed one counterattack and that allowed India. It was not difficult to hold the Indian attack</p>
