  <p><b>[Parma’s Alessandro Lucarelli says <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> Did Well To Limit <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> Stars]</b> It was a nice game and we played on the same level as <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>, succeeding in limiting <a href="antonio-cassano.html">Cassano</a> and Pazzini. We started out very well, then in the second half we tried to take advantage of the counter-attacks and the speed of <b>[Jonathan]</b> Biabiany. After the break, there will be two important survival games. We must continue on this path, improving in certain parts of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Parma defender Alessandro Lucarelli believes that <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> will have their minds focused on defeating his side]</b> Why? Because we are taking on the <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> after a break. Against these big squads, the only advantage you may have is if you play them after they have played a string of matches. But after two weeks of rest, they will come out and won’t be giving away presents<br /><br /><b>[For the 32-year-old, he will be playing against a former side of his]</b> I found myself being treated well when I was in Florence. I played 31 matches, and it was a positive experience. I may have only been there for one season, but there was a lot of pressure. <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> was in Serie B, and the society expected victories every week. It was something similar to last season with Parma</p>

  <p><b>[Parma captain Alessandro Lucarelli has launched a venomous attack on the disgusting farce surrounding the club following the reported arrest of president Giampietro Manenti]</b> I am bitter. There’s just a desire to shut everything down. <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>’s turned into a disgusting farce. It’s been difficult to take to the pitch for some time now and we’re still being dealt blows</p>
