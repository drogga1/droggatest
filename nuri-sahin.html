  <p><b>[Borussia <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> midfielder Nuri Sahin praises <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s mentality]</b> He does everything he can, he loves success and goes over dead bodies. He wins his games at half-time. His speeches are amazing! I still have them in my ears. Of course, every player wants to win, but <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> embodies the victory. Of course, tactics are important, of course, training is important, but humanity has lost something in this business, so I like guys such as <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and Klopp</p>

We suffer with football, we love football. I know we earn a lot of money. We have a privileged life, but we are human beings. There is so much more than football in this world, and last night, we felt it</p>

  <p><b>[UEFA should not have played Dortmund game 24 hours after bus bombing]</b> It’s hard to talk about. It’s hard to find the right words. I don’t wish anyone a feeling like this. I don’t know if the people can understand this but until I was on the pitch in the second half, I didn’t think about football to be honest because last night I didn’t realise what happened. When I got home and my wife and son were waiting at the door, then I felt how lucky we were.<br /><br />I get goosebumps. When we were on the bus last night … I will never forget those faces in my life for sure.<br /><br />I know football is very important. We love football, we suffer with football, and I know we earn a lot of money and have a privileged life. But we are human beings and there is so much more than football in this world.</p>

  <p><b>[Nuri Sahin on the Westfalenstadion’s Yellow Wall and the club’s supporters]</b> That day, the wall was the first thing I looked at when I walked on the pitch. And even now, it’s still the first thing I look to. From pitch level, you can’t even see where it ends. It’s just … yellow, as far as the eye can see. It’s the greatest sight in sport</p>

  <p><b>[Nuri Sahin says <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> is not looking to be the next <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>]</b> Which player can be compared to <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>, though? There is only a handful of players on the level of <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. As I know, Christian doesn’t put himself under pressure to be the next <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. I spoke to him and he also doesn’t have that pressure from the club, from his manager, so he will be OK. He will be a great player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but he will not be the next <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. It’s important to be the best version of <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Sahin added on a player still finding his feet in new surroundings after making a £58 million move]</b> It’s not easy to go to a huge club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and play the same way he did in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> but I was sure he would be OK. And now you can see some goals and some great games. If he is in full flow, he will be a big player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - he already is</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> midfielder Nuri Sahin has said that what makes his former boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> so special is the fact that the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager never forgets he is human]</b> The most special thing about <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is that he is so normal. I think it must be incredibly difficult to stay grounded when you’re him. I was with him during a season of crisis and he never forgot how to be human - that’s his greatest strength. Of course, there’s also his quality as a football coach!<br /><br /><b>[Elaborating on his tactical qualities]</b> The mix <b>[of dominance and counter-pressing]</b> is important because you don’t give teams any time in the long run - <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are probably the best at that at the moment. At the beginning of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s time there, they were reduced only to counter-pressing, but they developed. What <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did in 2008, 2009, that was the measure of all things. They had both possession of the ball and counter-pressing<br /><br /><b>[Sahin now plies his trade with Werder Bremen]</b> I’m extremely interested in the profession. It all started with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and continued with <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a>. I’m passionate about the profession and I try to soak up a lot. I try to take something out of interviews and documentaries. I don’t want to be like anyone else, I want to find my own coaching style. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is the measure of all things but I also found <a href="peter-bosz.html">Peter Bosz</a> and <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> really interesting on the tactics board - and Brendan Rodgers’ training sessions, too. I try to read every book about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. With Flo <b>[Bremen coach Florian Kohfelt]</b>, I particularly like how he sees the positional game. I also have <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a>’s number now too so I’ll call him sometimes too! I don’t know if I’ll be a good or bad coach, but I do know that I will love the job</p>

  <p><b>[Nuri Sahin admits he tried to lure <a href="claudio-pizarro.html">Claudio Pizarro</a> to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>]</b> On the pitch … Well, in the past I’d try to headhunt him! Whenever he played against us at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I always thought ‘Hey, you should come and play for us!’ because I always found him amazing in the box, the way he scored goals. I have to say he’s surprised me that despite his age, he’s still always up for training, which fascinated me and I found it really cool. Off the pitch he’s nice. We have a nice little relationship, I can speak to him a bit in Spanish, I can ask him something in Spanish and he can help me, even if he comes from South America and they speak a bit differently!<br /><br />He’s stayed young, for sure. He’s kept his feet on the ground</p>
