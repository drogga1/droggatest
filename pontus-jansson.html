  <p><b>[Leeds United have sold defender Pontus Jansson to Brentford for a reported fee of £5.5million]</b> I always liked having a close relationship with my trainer. As I had with Rolle Nilsson or Rikard Norling for example. It has not been as easy with Bielsa and there the language is a cause. I keep Bielsa in high regard, as one of the absolute best coaches I have had. He is special, believes hard in his ideas and I have learned a lot with him as a coach.<br /><br /><b>[The former Torino man refused to give the aforementioned row as a reason for his departure from Lee]</b> This is how football is. Leeds needed to sell to get a better balance in the economy because of the Financial Fair Play rules, and then they saw that they could make money from me</p>

  <p><b>[Pontus Jansson felt let down by Ibrahimovic’s new affiliation with Hammarby, Malmo’s rival club]</b> I woke up and saw the note about Hammarby and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and thought ‘what the hell is this?’. It was a weird feeling. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> shouldn’t be at Hammarby. It’s wrong. My Malmo heart is very disappointed.<br /><br />For me, <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> has been a role model since I was little. Now he has lost a great deal of my respect. It’s tragic. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> was one of Malmo’s sons. His statement about wanting to make Hammarby the biggest club in Scandinavia stung my ears the most.<br /><br />I could understand if it was just business, like if he got the stake in the club as part of his salary from <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> (the company AEG is affiliated with both sides) but he’s said all those other things and it’s sh*t - especially when it’s only been a month since the statue was revealed in Malmo.</p>
