  <p><b>[Pontus Jansson feels he emerged victorious in a previous battle with Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> I really killed him in that game so maybe he is scared of me. I have been aiming for the Premier League since the first day I came here. We are on the right way. We play good football and we win games even when we play bad football. That’s what a good team does.<br /><br /><b>[Pontus Jansson not convinced that Ibrahimovic’s future lies at Old Trafford]</b> Maybe he’s going back to Italy, I don’t know. We will see what’s happening. It would be nice to play against him again</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United centre-back Pontus Jansson says he cannot understand why some people are doubting his team’s status]</b> Underdogs? I cannot understand how you see us as underdogs when we are third in the table and beaten them (Derby) twice. Going into the play-offs as the third team, you should be favourites, if you ask me. We know that we are good, as we say it’s been a tough month for us but that gives us more motivation to be extra motivated to go into this play-offs. So, you can see us as underdogs if you want but no, not in our world. It has been a positive year for us, apart from this last month we’ve had some bad results. Apart from that it has been a fantastic year, now we just have to write the last chapter of it. We have to start on Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> have sold defender Pontus Jansson to Brentford for a reported fee of £5.5million]</b> I always liked having a close relationship with my trainer. As I had with Rolle Nilsson or Rikard Norling for example. It has not been as easy with <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> and there the language is a cause. I keep <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> in high regard, as one of the absolute best coaches I have had. He is special, believes hard in his ideas and I have learned a lot with him as a coach.<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> man refused to give the aforementioned row as a reason for his departure from Lee]</b> This is how football is. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> needed to sell to get a better balance in the economy because of the Financial Fair Play rules, and then they saw that they could make money from me</p>

  <p><b>[Pontus Jansson felt let down by Ibrahimovic’s new affiliation with Hammarby, Malmo’s rival club]</b> I woke up and saw the note about Hammarby and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and thought ‘what the hell is this?’. It was a weird feeling. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> shouldn’t be at Hammarby. It’s wrong. My Malmo heart is very disappointed.<br /><br />For me, <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> has been a role model since I was little. Now he has lost a great deal of my respect. It’s tragic. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> was one of Malmo’s sons. His statement about wanting to make Hammarby the biggest club in Scandinavia stung my ears the most.<br /><br />I could understand if it was just business, like if he got the stake in the club as part of his salary from <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> (the company AEG is affiliated with both sides) but he’s said all those other things and it’s shit - especially when it’s only been a month since the statue was revealed in Malmo.</p>
