<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Anwar Ali: India U17’s six feet plus tall central defender]</b> I had no problem whatsoever <b>[settling in]</b>. I gelled with my new teammates within a week.<br /><br />In 2012-13, I was with the U-14 Indian squad. The coach was Narayan Menon Sir from Kerala. He was looking for left-footed players amongst the squad and since I was one, I was picked to play the left full-back role. Before that I had always played as a striker. There are many players who cannot use their left-foot, but I am comfortable with both my feet<br /><br />Norton Sir is very friendly coach and he is not the angry kind. He keeps an eye on every player and looks out for what is going on in our lives. He is kind of a mentor to us<br /><br />I have never played in such stadiums earlier in front of so many fans but the expected pressure is normal, I am used to dealing with it.<br /><br />I was interested in cricket since an early age though my dad was a football fan. So I would accompany my dad to some football games and that is how I got into the sport</p>
