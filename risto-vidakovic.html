  <p>[Serbian Risto Vidakovic reckons that the match on Tuesday will be a difficult one for both side given the lack of match practice] Of course. We always have to change something. It’s a different game, it’s a different stadium. We know each other much more. We played 3 weeks ago and neither of us have played since. It will be a very hard game for both teams.<br /><br />We will see [if Ceres can maintain top position]. All the teams are strong. We have champions from Vietnam and strong teams from Malaysia and Singapore. You can see from the table it’s not big difference from first to last. One win and many things can change</p>

  <p>[Risto Vidakovic wants his players to bounce back in the next game in the AFC Cup after a disparaging 3-0 defeat at the hands of Felda United] Today I think Felda was the better team. They scored good goals. For us, we had to change the plans and it was very difficult. We planned something different but they scored very early and it was very hard for us. The two goals were very good, especially the second goal. When that went it, we lose all momentum. As I said before the game, everyone have the possibility to qualify. We now have a home game and we have to fight for that.</p>
