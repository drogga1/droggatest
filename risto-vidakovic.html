  <p><b>[Serbian Risto Vidakovic reckons that the match on Tuesday will be a difficult one for both side given the lack of match practice]</b> Of course. We always have to change something. It’s a different game, it’s a different stadium. We know each other much more. We played 3 weeks ago and neither of us have played since. It will be a very hard game for both teams.<br /><br />We will see <b>[if Ceres can maintain top position]</b>. All the teams are strong. We have champions from Vietnam and strong teams from Malaysia and Singapore. You can see from the table it’s not big difference from first to last. One win and many things can change</p>

  <p><b>[Risto Vidakovic wants his players to bounce back in the next game in the AFC Cup after a disparaging 3-0 defeat at the hands of Felda United]</b> Today I think Felda was the better team. They scored good goals. For us, we had to change the plans and it was very difficult. We planned something different but they scored very early and it was very hard for us. The two goals were very good, especially the second goal. When that went it, we lose all momentum. As I said before the game, everyone have the possibility to qualify. We now have a home game and we have to fight for that.</p>

  <p><b>[For head coach Risto Vidakovic, he understands that JDT will be a tougher hurdle than Felda]</b> For us it’s a big challenge to play this game. We have to do the same things we did before, just to keep compete. I’m sure my players will do everything to reach a good result. My target is for my players to give 100% and compete.<br /><br />They <b>[JDT]</b> play offensive football and i don’t think they will change anything because they are playing at home. They have a lot of good players - foreign and national players. For me, when I play against some clubs, I see the whole team not just some individual players<br /><br />They play at home and they are a big club. If i said we are favourites, it’s not true. In football, you never know - anything can happen. There are no favourites. They are strong team of course but we have our opportunities - of course we would go for it</p>

  <p><b>[For Ceres-Negros FC coach Risto Vidakovic, he applauded a very good performance from both teams]</b> It was a very tough game. For the crowd it was a very good game. We have another game at home to change it. It will not be easy because we’re playing the strongest team. But we will do what we can. This is football. Sometimes you score, sometimes you don’t. We are a small club against a giant club. I think we got a very good result. I’m very proud of my players.<br /><br />Yes <b>[it was our tactic to play on the counter]</b>. We talked about how Johor play at home. They are a very offensive team. We talk about the space they leave behind at the full backs. Two times, we scored two goals</p>

  <p><b>[JDT and Ceres clash, a test of mental fortitude]</b> I’m always saying the same. For us it’s a challenge. We don’t do anything special, it’s the usual for us to prepare. We have our style of the game and we don’t change.</p>

  <p><b>[Ceres-Negros FC triumphed against Johor Darul Ta’zim on Wednesday night after late drama in the opponents’ penalty box helped secure a 2-1 win on the night and a 4-4 result on aggregate]</b> It was a tough game and it was difficult to control emotions especially when you need to win. We played a very good first half. Second half JDT played well. Overall, I think we deserve it to qualify. It was very hard to play in the second half becaues they pressed high and our players were tired. We were lucky it was a penalty and we scored. The most important thing is that we go forward.<br /><br />We have a lot of time. Tonight <b>[Wednesday]</b> we celebrate the win</p>
