  <p><b>[Shakhtar Donetsk star Taison shown red card after reacting to racist abuse]</b> Shakhtar categorically opposes any manifestations and forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and any related intolerance. There can be no justification of those who insult other people because of their skin colour, religious, or political beliefs. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable in any civilised countries and football leagues. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> imposes the toughest sanctions on the clubs and associations for their fans’ racist behaviour in matches. Such humiliating incidents cause pain and disappointment to the large football family of FC Shakhtar. We condemn this kind of behaviour of the crowd. We will always voice support for and protect our players. We are calling on football authorities and clubs to stop racism in stadiums</p>

  <p><b>[Taison also addressed the incident on his official Instagram account, vowing to never allow such racist intolerance to silence him]</b> I love my race, I fight for colour, whatever I do is for us, for love. I will never shut up in the face of such an inhuman and despicable act! My tears were of indignation, repudiation and helplessness, helplessness that I could do nothing at that moment! But we are taught early on to be strong and to fight! Fight for our rights and for equality! My role is to fight, to beat my chest, to lift my head and keep fighting always! In a racist society, it is not enough not to be racist, we must be anti-racist! Football needs more respect; the world needs more respect! Thank you all for the support messages! We continue the fight</p>
