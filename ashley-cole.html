Coaching or being a scout is something I’ve always considered and enjoyed while watching games.

I’m just disappointed we’re losing, but I want to keep going until my legs actually give out. Thankfully they haven’t given up just yet.<br /><br />My legs feel okay. Maybe the head feels a little bit tired, but I’m enjoying football whether we win or lose. I love the game. I only want to stop when my heart for it finishes.

He came and he brought this new lease of life, it was like playing for Brazil. He had me bombing up and down against players like Jamie Carragher, with <b>[Jose]</b> Bosingwa on the other side. We had no rules, we could go where we wanted, left and right-backs going at the same time. We were playing great football, but by December it had petered out and he got the sack.<br /><br /><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> I don’t think he’s under pressure. He’s trying to put his philosophy on it. I watched Sarri-ball in Italy and the football they played is amazing. It’s different now but I think it boils down to confidence. They had the confidence to play out of the back. Some of the Chelsea players have to get with it sooner rather than later</p>

Him, <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane all play well together but I think he’s become a little bit more ‘it’s about me now, it’s my time’.

He’s obviously come here and changed a few things, brought his own philosophy here, the way he wants to play. I think the team has done brilliantly so far, so no, no surprise how good he’s done. The youth players have been great. A lot of people were probably saying he had no choice to play them, but I think he knows if they weren’t good enough he wouldn’t play them.

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Ashley Cole were not impressed with Alonso’s casual tracking of Yarmolenko for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>’s late winner]</b> One of the things I hate about full-backs is when you’re happy to run back but not track. I get they’re pushing for it, last five minutes of the game, but you need a point here. Could he have run back, could he have run back with the intensity he ran forwards? Probably, yes. Could he anticipate earlier? Yes</p>

He never gives up. Technically, he’s not like a <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> or an <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, but it’s the work ethic and the fact he’s always in the right spot</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole on Saka]</b> Watching Saka’s interview, he feels like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is his home and he’s a young kid. I think the group they’ve got around him with extra young players is making him feel very welcome and at home so I bet <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans are buzzing that he’s signed and he definitely looks like one for the future.</p>
