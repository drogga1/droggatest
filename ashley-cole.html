  <p><b>[Ashley Cole has snubbed Jose Mourinho when selecting his favourite Chelsea boss, with Carlo Ancelotti considered to have been the number one]</b> I think the managers who suited my style were more attacking, which is how I had played at Arsenal. When Luiz Felipe Scolari came in I felt at my best. I felt I blossomed under him and got back to playing with confidence. Ancelotti was my number one. We played with tactics, obviously, but he gave you a freedom and I was able to attack. That double season in 2009-10 was probably my best season. It was the most I scored in a season, I felt I was unbeatable in defence and was linking up with others well. I had a great relationship with Florent Malouda on the left wing, JT <b>[John Terry]</b> next to me and Frank Lampard on that left side of the midfield three. I was able to make runs in behind and was always in dangerous spots inside the box<br /><br /><b>[His decision to leave the Gunners was justified as he went on to collect an impressive trophy haul with the Blues]</b> I felt nerves. I knew a lot of the players, but it was nerve-wracking coming to a new team with a new manager. I was excited. It was a tough decision to make at the time, but I was eager to get going. I came to the club a little bit angry inside. I wanted to prove what I was worth, that I was good enough to play at the top and I wanted to keep on winning. The Arsenal ‘Invincibles’ team was a team of winners with big personalities. But over time, the big players were leaving - Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp was finishing, Thierry Henry - and I wanted to be around a team that had that will and desire to win. I’d played with Frank and John Terry with England, Joe Cole, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips too, and I liked that mentality. They had won the league back to back and I wanted to be part of it. I was ready for it</p>

The manager needs time, the players need time and I don’t think everyone should panic yet</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole hopes <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> appoint interim head coach <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> as their permanent new boss]</b> Every club has to change. They’re in another transition period at the minute where they tried Emery and for whatever reason it didn’t work out. Now Freddie is there and hopefully he can take over as permanent manager because he knows the club inside out. Freddie was my friend when I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and hopefully he can change some things there.<br /><br /><b>[Cole, currently working as an academy coach at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, is full of praise for the work <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has done]</b> I’m delighted. I was lucky enough to work with him at <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> before he came here and I knew how good he could be. He’s obviously come here and changed a few things, brought his own philosophy here, the way he wants to play. I think the team has done brilliantly so far, so no, no surprise how good he’s done. The youth players have been great. A lot of people were probably saying he had no choice to play them, but I think he knows if they weren’t good enough he wouldn’t play them. But they’ve been brilliant, they’ve adapted well from playing in the Championship as most of them did last season and I think they are the driving force of this team at the minute<br /><br /><b>[when asked about <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a>’s future]</b> I wouldn’t say his time is coming to an end. Tactically sometimes maybe the manager wants fresh ideas, fresh players. It comes with the job, you can’t play every game. It happened to me: Cesar took my place. He’s still the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain. It’s not about just what he does on the pitch, it’s how he motivates the players off it and I’ve been around that and seen how good he is at that. I don’t think it will worry him. It will probably spur him on to be even better and train even harder, which is hard to do because he is a beast at training</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> still the best in the world]</b> It’s tough. You want different positions maybe being credited with how good they’ve played in that season, but to be honest I don’t think you can look outside of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. What <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> does week in, week out is not normal. Again, the same with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. It wasn’t a surprise that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> won it but one day, yeah, we probably would like a defender to win it<br /><br /><b>[One left-back who has impressed Cole in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season is Ben Chilwell]</b> I think, for me, <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> and <b>[Liverpool’s Andy]</b> Robertson are the best two left-backs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the minute. He’s playing in a good <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> team, suiting his game at the minute where he can attack and he’s got protection behind him. Whether he starts for England? That’s probably a question for Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b>. I’d like to see him start because I think when he has played for England he’s played very well. He looks accomplished there. I’d like to see him start but that’s down to the manager</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole says he love to see <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> at Chelsea]</b> I would love to see him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He’s doing really, really well at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. He’s enjoying the way Brendan plays and his system; he’s got that licence to attack. When he’s played for England he’s played well – in his last game he got three assists. He’s shown quality not just on the ball, but one-on-one he can defend and he likes to defend. I think he’s quality and I’ve heard he’s a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fan, too, so I would like to see him here. Whether he would want to leave, or if <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> would want to sell him, that’s something the clubs would have to talk about. Not forgetting we’ve got Alonso here and <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a>, who I like, and Cesar can also play there. So if you buy a player you’ve still got another three players you need to try to keep happy or whether they want to leave or not <b>[…]</b> so it’s a big decision for the club. But he’s got the quality. For sure he’s good enough</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> won’t rock boat but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need to add]</b> I think every top club should improve if they can. Yes, I’ll probably assume that he won’t want to take out some young players but I think as a squad it definitely needs players added to it. But you don’t want to rock the boat maybe a little bit too much. So he wants to keep that consistency in certain players he has but he definitely for me has to add<br /><br /><b>[Cole admits <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> will have been concerned by that wobble]</b> I think he will definitely have a little bit of concern. But he knew that the players weren’t going to play well <b>[every week]</b>, the consistency is not going to be there, playing a lot of young players. It’s not an excuse that we always keep saying about the young players but it’s a fact. They’re not ready to play 38 games through a season and not have a bad game. It’s normal that they’re going to have bad games. They went through a bad period, we knew that was going to happen. But now, how can Frank motivate them and get them mentally and physically ready?</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Cole says he could feel <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s winning culture falling apart before he left the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> for Chelsea]</b> The transition in terms of being in a different group, environment and players was easy because at the time when I first started at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, we had a core – the Keowns, the Seamans, the Vieiras, the Henrys, the Adams’. When they started to leave, I felt there were holes in the culture of what it was that brought success. I just felt it was falling apart a bit, or there were gaps missing and they weren’t filled. So that transition in terms of finding myself in a different culture and the willingness and want to win, I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I had that.<br /><br />Yeah, I think when you look back, there were mistakes, for sure, on both sides. One hundred per cent, it’s not just entirely my fault and it’s not entirely their fault. I was probably a little bit too stubborn at the time and felt a little bit hard done by. I was a little bit babyish to be honest, but it’s something I won’t ever regret and I wouldn’t ever change that situation. It’s just something that happened. Maybe it was meant to be, who knows? But I definitely feel unjust about it because it wasn’t what people think in terms of money. It’s crazy, but that was probably the last thing on my mind</p>

I get they’re pushing for it, last five minutes of the game, but you need a point here. Could he have run back, could he have run back with the intensity he ran forwards? Probably, yes.
