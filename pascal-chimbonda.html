  <p><b>[Pascal Chimbonda says Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen ‘won’t play in Real Madrid’s first team’ if he decides to join the club during the transfer window]</b> It’s in Tottenham and Eriksen’s best interest for him to leave the club this summer. Eriksen won’t play in Real Madrid’s first team, but it’s the price he will have to pay for trophies. Madrid have too many world class players in the form of Hazard, Modic and Kroos, who will all get ahead of him on the team sheet. Madrid is a massive club and there is no room for players to have an off day. If Eriksen has a dip in form, another player will be waiting to come in and take his place, which isn’t the case at Tottenham. It’s a massive step for him, but one he needs to take. He has shown he can single-handedly win games and I believe he would do the same at Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[Spurs have reportedly identified Real Betis midfielder Giovani Lo Celso as a transfer target in recent weeks]</b> Lo Celso would definitely be able to fill <b>[Eriksen’s]</b> shoes. He’s a very clever player and can unlock defences with his passing ability, which is what Eriksen brought to the team. He improved massively when moving to Betis as he had better players around him and I think it would be the same if he moved to Tottenham. Having the likes of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Lucas Moura in front of him will make him a real handful against any opposition</p>

  <p><b>[Pascal Chimbonda says Tottenham should be looking to keep Kieran Trippier while snapping up Ryan Sessegnon]</b> Tripper won’t be sold this window and will remain Tottenham’s first choice right back. He clearly struggled last season, but he will be a completely new player now he’s had a summer to rest without any international tournaments. With Serge Aurier being injured throughout the season, it didn’t give Tripper a chance to rest when he needed it most. He’s proven he can play at the top level and you don’t lose that overnight. I expect we’ll see Tripper back to his best next season.<br /><br /><b>[Chimbonda believes that Spurs were right to stay out of the market which saw Manchester United spend £50 million on Aaron Wan-Bissaka]</b> Tottenham made the right choice to not try and sign Wan-Bissaka. He had a very good season for Palace, but he’s still very far off from becoming a proven player. Tottenham need to strengthen other parts of the pitch more urgently and Wan-Bissaka would have taken a massive wedge out of the transfer budget<br /><br /><b>[One area that Chimbonda would like to see strengthened is the left flank]</b> <b>[Mauricio]</b> Pochettino can unlock Sessegnon’s full potential and would be a great signing for Tottenham. It’s unfair to judge him on last season’s performance as he was played in various positions in a team where everyone struggled to find their feet. He’s still very young and needs the guidance to fulfil his potential. Pochettino can offer him that as well as Danny Rose. I think Rose would be an excellent player for Sessegnon to learn from and it would give him some healthy competition. They are very similar in terms of both being attackingly strong, but Rose can improve Sessegnon’s defensive capabilities</p>

  <p><b>[Pascal Chimbonda says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will not accept anything less than <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> money for Harry Kane]</b> If <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> was to go to <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> and say ‘listen, Mr Chairman, I want to leave so I can go play in a big team and win trophies’ then I think Levy would maybe let him go. But unless Kane makes that move, I don’t think he’ll leave. He seems happy there, he’s a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> boy, he’s the main man and he’s got everything he needs. If he stays, he will be the club captain pretty soon too, so maybe he won’t ever want to leave. <br /><br />Levy is a shrewd businessman. When he does business, he does it well. We saw it with <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> when he sold him to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - he held out and held out until he got the absolute maximum Madrid would pay for him, which turned out to be a world record fee. If he was to sell Kane, you know Levy is not going to let him go lightly. I don’t think he’d accept anything less than what <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> paid <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> so it might have to be another world record if anyone wanted to buy him. I wouldn’t put it past <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or even <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> paying that sort of money though, because what we’ve seen over the past couple of years is that money is no real object if one of the top, top clubs really want a specific player<br /><br />I don’t think for one second that <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s best days are behind him. When you look at someone like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, he’s 34 and you could argue that he’s as good as he ever was. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> improved after his mid-20s and I don’t see why Kane can’t do the same. The only question is, will he be able to improve if he stays in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>? <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had to leave <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to reach another level at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.<br /><br />If Kane was to stay at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, and they don’t improve much, can he fulfil his individual potential? If he goes abroad maybe to a Spanish team he could improve more and more and win more and more. He still has plenty of time, so there’s no rush to leave. And I don’t think his club form is anything to be worried about - he’s still got 10 goals this season, which isn’t bad.<br /><br />Sometimes strikers just need a little confidence in those around them as well as themselves, and maybe Harry doesn’t quite have that at club level right now. But all it will take is for him to score three or four goals in two or three games for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and everyone will be saying ‘he’s back’ - so I’m not concerned at all</p>

Dare I say it, but I think someone like <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> fits the bill. It’s obvious <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> doesn’t fancy him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I’m sure <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> wants out, so why not him? Yes, he’s a former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player, but he’s also a World Cup winner and presumably he’s available. I’d take him on loan, but if the opportunity was there to buy him, then I’d buy him. There’s no one else readily available on the market who has his quality</p>

  <p><b>[Pascal Chimbonda has admitted his infamous transfer request at Wigan Athletic was a mistake]</b> That’s my biggest regret. That changed a lot of things. I didn’t do what I did then maybe I would have joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. But when I made this mistake, I threw my chance away. <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> didn’t want to sign someone who would do this. Wigan were so mad, they didn’t say anything to me. At the end of the game I gave a written letter to the manager in the dressing room, and he opened it in front of everyone. I wasn’t even showered yet. The chairman was there too and I thought ‘what have I done?’ What a stupid thing to do. We were supposed to meet on the Monday, but I was told the manager doesn’t want to see you. Just go on holiday. That’s my big regret. If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t do this<br /><br />We were all upset because <a href="martin-jol.html">Martin Jol</a> was close to all of us. After the game we said goodbye and couldn’t really believe it. He left in a really bad way. There was a lot of shock because the players were close to him. Some were crying. In the dressing room, he said he was going. It was really sad, really tough. Every time you asked him something he gave it to you. He trusted you. He was always very straightforward. He was the best manager I had at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He was always there at training on the pitch, I like a manager like this. That’s how you see your players, you can’t just ask your assistant because if he doesn’t like one player he might be like, ‘Oh no don’t play him’.</p>

  <p><b>[Pascal Chimbonda on making the France squad for Germany 2006]</b> When France won the 1998 World Cup, I wasn’t even a professional. I was still in Guadeloupe, watching on TV. And eight years later there I was. I was telling my mum in 1998, ‘You will see me in that team.’ It shows why you should never quit</p>
