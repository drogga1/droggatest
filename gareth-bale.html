Everyone is devastated and it is a massive loss to everyone in football. It is a tragedy, everyone still can’t get their head around it and all our condolences go out to his family and his kids. It is a hard time. We were on the up, he changed the way we play and the whole mentality of our game. It is a massive loss, but we will try and carry on the best we can in his honor</p>

The group sensation is excellent and we’re training well. Everything is set up for this team to make it out of the group. The key now for us is to perform on the pitch.<br /><br />It’s exciting, we have a great team and we’re feeling confident. The possibility of securing qualification is adding to our confidence. It’s our responsibility, we’re representing our country. It doesn’t matter where, or on what surface, we’ll give everything to ensure a win. A good start is vital</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale bemoaned the state of the Andorra pitch following Wales’s narrow 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying victory on Tuesday]</b> This is by far the worst pitch I’ve ever played on but it’s the same for both teams. We said in the changing rooms before the game, ‘No matter how we get the three points, we get them’ and that’s what we did.<br /><br />We knew we had enough time in the game to show our football, to show our ability and to show the character in the squad and we certainly did that. It was obviously disappointing to concede a penalty but it’s massively important to get an equaliser straight away and we had massive possession of the ball. They obviously made it difficult, which is what they’re going to do to every team, but we showed our class. We kept passing the ball as well as we could on such a bad pitch and showed our class in the end<br /><br /><b>[Bale feels that the confidence gained from Tuesday’s comeback victory will stand them in good stead]</b> It gives us confidence. That’s the most important thing. All we could do was get the three points, no matter how we did it. It’s a good start and the next game is another final and we’ll go into that being confident and hopeful of a win</p>

  <p><b>[Wales star Gareth Bale said his team-mates are hungry to progress to Euro 2016]</b> It was a great start from us again. We came out of the blocks firing, like we wanted to. We got a good start to the game, obviously a little mistake off a set-piece, but I think you can see how much the lads want it. It’s a different feeling in the camp now, everyone’s really fighting for each other, the team spirit’s amazing and the fans again were literally unbelievable.<br /><br />I think you need a bit of luck sometimes. Obviously it didn’t go for us today <b>[with the dismissal]</b>, but I think we showed hard work. Since the sending off, we worked hard as a team. I think - again - we covered every blade of grass and showed how much we want it<br /><br />It’s obviously a great place to be. I think the minimum from these two games was four points, we knew it was going to be a difficult game against Bosnia and a winnable one tonight. I think when guys like <b>[Fulham youngster George Williams]</b> come in, they do a fantastic job. It’s a big game against Belgium, and we’ll go there full of confidence</p>

In previous years we definitely would have caved in but we showed what we are made of. It’s something to build on and now we must keep plugging away. Israel will be a huge game but, if we realistically want to qualify, then every game is massive, like a final. We move on to the next camp and we’ll be aiming to get the three points. At the moment it’s going our way - it’s been difficult but it’s down to our hard work. We feel like we are getting what we deserve.</p>

There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that. I don’t feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football. I love playing for Wales, it’s a big honour and the most important thing is I focus on my football. I don’t listen to anyone else, what they’re saying, just enjoy my football with the boys.<br /><br />It’s obviously great to score for Wales and all that comes with it but the most important thing was the victory. We put a great performance in, just worked hard, every single player on the pitch deserves the credit</p>

I don’t think I’ve had the best of games tonight but when there’s a chance hopefully I can tuck it away and luckily enough I did tonight to give us an important three points.<br /><br />We knew the task coming in.

This ranks right up there in terms of my career, it’s something I’ve always wanted to do and every young boy dreams of playing at a major tournament. Now we want to go over there and do something in France.<br /><br />We’re like brothers out the pitch and there’s so much togetherness in this squad.

Obviously, it was a big disappointment to see him go but things like this happen in football: you’re professional and you get on with it, and carry on. I’m happy at the moment. Obviously, you can never predict what happens in the future but I’m enjoying my football at the moment, so I’ll keep going<br /><br />That <b>[was]</b> nice of him to say. We had a chat when he first came in. No matter what, I’ll always give 100% on a football pitch and that’s what I did tonight. I just want to keep playing my football. I don’t feel I need to make a statement to anyone. I know what I’m capable of and I just want to keep enjoying my football, and when I do that I play my best football<br /><br />There have been comments in previous interviews and stuff <b>[commenting on the fact that]</b> I’ve been stuck on the right, and I didn’t have that freedom but now on the right I’m able to come in and float around a bit as well. Obviously, my main position would be on the right. I’m enjoying my football, I’m enjoying my position at the moment and hopefully I continue to do so<br /><br />My best position is being able to roam around the front and try and find weaknesses in the defence, I suppose. Everybody knows where I like to play and what I like to do on the pitch, and hopefully I can keep doing it<br /><br />I don’t think there was too much difference, to be honest. We’ve been working hard of late and maybe we didn’t have a bit of luck before but I think we’re all working the same amount on the football pitch. We’re all giving 100% and the most important thing is we win games and win titles<br /><br /><b>[That is something Bale believes they can still do, despite trailing both <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Atlético Madrid at the top of the table]</b> I think this time last year we were clear and we hadn’t lost in 22 games or something.

They’ve progressed over the years. They’ve been a force in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and are starting to be in Europe. Hopefully now we can stop them<br /><br />I don’t feel I have a point to prove. I’ve played long enough to be OK about that. We want to stamp our authority and win by as many goals as we can. It’s going to be difficult. The first legs are always a bit tense, a bit cagey. It’ll be great to score goals, but all we’re going to do is give our best. Hopefully that will be enough. Whenever I step on the pitch I try and do the best I can. We all want to work together as a team. We attack together and defend together. Whoever wins the game, if we keep clean sheets it’s for all of us to celebrate. We’re a united team<br /><br />We’re feeling confident at the moment. We’ve not had great performances away at Wolfsburg <b>[losing 2-0 in previous round]</b> we’ve learned from it and corrected it. We need to impose ourselves. We’ve looked back at Wolfsburg - we need to be a bit more patient and not go for the kill straight away. We have to be smart - attack when we can</p>

There is not a specific main venue where you can go and watch sport. It would be nice for people to come and for it to be known for airing big events, with nice food and drink with a family friendly atmosphere.<br /><br />I have been to sports bars around the world before and it is nice to get that sports bar food, the pizzas, the burgers, the picky stuff that everyone loves. We hope to have the best burger in Cardiff and really looking forward to getting people in to enjoy the experience<br /><br />It was massively important for us to work with somebody like Brains, the leading brewer in Wales. They have been involved with football in the community and they have sponsored the FAW for a long time. A great choice for us to work together. It is about providing a location where everyone can go and have a great experience while watching sport. The site of the Elevens Bar &amp; Grill has been a pub since the 1730s and with this new lease of life it will remain an iconic Cardiff venue for many more years to come</p>

It makes the award look a little diminished, although it was obviously a great goal by Salah.<br /><br />It was instinctive. I got my body positioned correctly, got my footwork right, and caught it perfectly. When you catch the ball perfectly, you know it’s on target. You just have to hope the keeper doesn’t make an unbelievable save. So as soon as I hit it, I knew it had a chance of going in. If you watch it, you see my head turn straight away. I knew where the ball was going<br /><br />I think you’d have to say that <b>[it was my best goal]</b>. There haven’t been too many like that!

  <p><b>[‘Tottenham fan’ Bale looks back on Spurs’ Champions League heartbreak]</b> Everybody loves tuning in to watch the Champions League final, and obviously <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were there so I had a very keen interest, I was hoping they’d get to the final like they did. They had some great matches on the way, obviously in the semi-final <b>[against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>]</b>. For us <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans it was a bit disappointing in the final, but you have to look at the bigger picture. They did great to get there and gave a good account of themselves<br /><br /><b>[For Bale, though, scoring and beating <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to clinch La Decima six years ago remains his favourite]</b> They all have their own special moments. The first one is always so special because I’d never won a trophy before and you don’t know the experience, excitement and euphoria you get from lifting the trophy. Winning in my home city was an incredible moment for me personally because not many people get to do that. Then the last final <b>[against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I played in I scored that goal and for it to be the winning goal was also special. It’s difficult to pick one but in terms of the overall experience I’d go for the first one because it was the first final and I didn’t expect what was coming, the nerves of it and how we won it in the last minute. The celebrations were something I’d never experienced before. Everything was just new, so it was really exciting and it made it so special<br /><br />It’s quite a strict lockdown, we can’t go out at all, can’t go out for a walk or exercise or anything. It’s very strict, but I guess we’re all doing it for the greater good. Everyone wants to play football, but the most important thing is everyone stays safe, we don’t come back too early and we make sure everything is done safely so we avoid the second wave of this virus. The difficult thing, you hear everyone saying they want to get the season finished and do this and that. But you need to look at the bigger picture, the most important thing is everyone’s health. With football, everyone misses it and wants to play, everyone wants to watch. But the bigger picture is there will be many more seasons of football, Champions Leagues, leagues and cups, the important thing is getting this right now, if we can get that right, it’ll make football last much longer in the future and we won’t have a problem like this in the future</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star Bale reveals interest in future <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> move]</b> I really like the league, it’s grown so much over the years. The standard’s getting a lot better, clubs are improving, facilities and stadiums are improving. When we come over and play in pre-season the games are difficult…it’s a league that’s on the up and still rising. A lot more players want to come to America now. I would definitely be interested in it.<br /><br />I loved my time at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the fans were incredible, the club treated me amazingly. I was enjoying it but when one of the biggest clubs in the world comes after you, you want to take that opportunity<br /><br /><b>[The Welshman also named the best managers he’s played under throughout his career, including <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> and <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Andre Villas-Boas</a> on his final list but leaving off <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>]</b> <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> was good, he let you do what you wanted to get the best out of you. AVB I had a really good relationship with. He said ‘you have the licence to go where you want, right, middle, left’. It made me feel like I could score whenever I wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has hit out at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans who have jeered him during his time with the Primera Division club]</b> It’s one of those things. I didn’t know too much about it coming to Madrid. It’s one of those things that you don’t expect. You don’t expect your own supporters to do that to their own player. I get it if it is aimed at the team if you’re not playing well or at half-time you’re down by a couple. But to boo your own player, or whistle your own player like they do it’s just wrong. Because if you are having a bad game you want your fans to get behind you. If they start whistling your confidence goes down even more - everything becomes more difficult. You’re going to play worse, which is going to make them more angry. They are hurting themselves in a way. To me, it makes no sense. It baffles me to this day. I just don’t understand, it doesn’t make any sense to me<br /><br />I’d seen the banner a few weeks before. The boys had shown me and they said: ‘If we do qualify, let’s try and find it and bring it out.’ I was like: ‘Do what you want but I won’t be going over to get it’. They brought it down, we were all celebrating as a team and I’m not going to not jump around with my team-mates. It was a bit of banter. A bit of fun. People can see it how they like</p>

  <p><b>[Bale calls for calm over his golf habit, saying: Stephen Curry plays on the same morning of the game]</b> A lot of people have problems with me playing golf. I don’t know why. I’ve talked about it many times and everyone thinks it’s fine, but especially in the media there is that perception that I should be resting, that it can lead to injuries. I see people in America, for example Stephen Curry, who plays the same morning of the game. Here, if I play two days before the game it’s like: ‘What are you doing?’</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans jeering him has hurt his confidence]</b> We get a lot of pressure every game. If you don’t play well, there’s scrutiny. I’ve had 80,000 people in a stadium whistle at me because I haven’t played well. I’ve had it a few times! It’s not nice and it doesn’t do your confidence any good either<br /><br /><b>[When asked why they do it]</b> This is the biggest question and I just don’t get it. You would expect that if you’re not having a good time on the pitch, your fans would get behind you and try to help you do better because it’ll make them happy. But it seems that they do the opposite. They whistle you, which consequentially makes you feel worse, you lose your confidence, you play worse and then that makes them even more upset<br /><br />In football, you might play amazing, not score for five games, and then everyone says you’re having a terrible time. You think to yourself that you’re playing well, you just haven’t scored or assisted. But people just like goals, assists and ‘wow’ things. Sometimes that doesn’t always happen.<br /><br /><b>[Bale says he is also still confused that his love for playing golf has caused such a stir in Spain]</b> A lot of people have problems with me playing golf. I don’t know what their reason is because I’ve spoken to doctors and everybody’s fine with it. The media has this perception that it’s not good for me, you should be resting, it can cause you injuries. Steph Curry (NBA basketball player) plays maybe on the morning of a game. If I play two days before a game, it’s like ‘what’s he doing?’. It’s nice to be on the course and just get away from everything. I play with a few friends or sometimes play on my own, put some music on, play 18 holes and just relax and get away from everything. I then don’t have to think about football, especially if it’s not going well.</p>
