It is a hard time. We were on the up, he changed the way we play and the whole mentality of our game. It is a massive loss, but we will try and carry on the best we can in his honor</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale saddened by Benítez exit but basks in <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> acclaim]</b> I had a very good relationship with Rafa. Obviously, it was a big disappointment to see him go but things like this happen in football: you’re professional and you get on with it, and carry on. I’m happy at the moment. Obviously, you can never predict what happens in the future but I’m enjoying my football at the moment, so I’ll keep going<br /><br />That <b>[was]</b> nice of him to say. We had a chat when he first came in. No matter what, I’ll always give 100% on a football pitch and that’s what I did tonight. I just want to keep playing my football. I don’t feel I need to make a statement to anyone. I know what I’m capable of and I just want to keep enjoying my football, and when I do that I play my best football<br /><br />There have been comments in previous interviews and stuff <b>[commenting on the fact that]</b> I’ve been stuck on the right, and I didn’t have that freedom but now on the right I’m able to come in and float around a bit as well. Obviously, my main position would be on the right. I’m enjoying my football, I’m enjoying my position at the moment and hopefully I continue to do so<br /><br />My best position is being able to roam around the front and try and find weaknesses in the defence, I suppose. Everybody knows where I like to play and what I like to do on the pitch, and hopefully I can keep doing it<br /><br />I don’t think there was too much difference, to be honest. We’ve been working hard of late and maybe we didn’t have a bit of luck before but I think we’re all working the same amount on the football pitch. We’re all giving 100% and the most important thing is we win games and win titles<br /><br /><b>[That is something Bale believes they can still do, despite trailing both <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Atlético Madrid at the top of the table]</b> I think this time last year we were clear and we hadn’t lost in 22 games or something.

They’ve progressed over the years. They’ve been a force in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and are starting to be in Europe. Hopefully now we can stop them<br /><br />I don’t feel I have a point to prove. I’ve played long enough to be OK about that. We want to stamp our authority and win by as many goals as we can. It’s going to be difficult. The first legs are always a bit tense, a bit cagey. It’ll be great to score goals, but all we’re going to do is give our best. Hopefully that will be enough. Whenever I step on the pitch I try and do the best I can. We all want to work together as a team. We attack together and defend together. Whoever wins the game, if we keep clean sheets it’s for all of us to celebrate. We’re a united team<br /><br />We’re feeling confident at the moment. We’ve not had great performances away at Wolfsburg <b>[losing 2-0 in previous round]</b> we’ve learned from it and corrected it. We need to impose ourselves. We’ve looked back at Wolfsburg - we need to be a bit more patient and not go for the kill straight away. We have to be smart - attack when we can</p>

I don’t read anything and I don’t listen to anyone. I know most people don’t know or don’t understand the situation. What they write means nothing. It didn’t impact on me too much. It’s obviously not been great, but I wouldn’t say it’s the worst time of my career. I remember not playing for a year <b>[at Tottenham]</b> under <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a>. It’s not been ideal, but I have been here before and I know how to deal with it. I had a great summer holiday. Coming back to pre-season I just kept my head down. I know there was a lot of talk with everybody saying whatever they wanted. I just worked hard in training and got myself ready. The things that happened will stay private with the club. If you want answers, maybe you need to ask <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Football can turn quickly<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on whether he now feels more settled, with two goals and a red card collected in his last outing for Real]</b> I suppose so. The transfer window is closed now! I am obviously fully fit and I am ready to go. Maybe I wasn’t in the summer. I don’t think mentally it <b>[the criticism]</b> affected me at all, but not playing for four, five or six weeks meant physically I wasn’t where I wanted to be. I am a professional and I am paid to play football. You go through ups and downs and people like to say whatever they want. At the end of the day I keep working hard in training. If you keep working hard things will turn and you will get rewarded for that<br /><br />I am a golfer. Have you not seen the pictures? I spoke to him <b>[Courtois]</b> about it and he said it as a joke. People took it out of context, but I’m very happy with the nickname to be honest. It’s a great one. Football is my No.1 sport. I’m paid to do it and I always give my best. Golf is a hobby like anyone else would have a hobby. There is nothing wrong with having a round. People make a lot of it, but a lot of footballers play and it’s one thing I really enjoy. It keeps me calmer off the pitch and gives me time away from football which is nice</p>

Towards the end of last season was difficult, there is no denying that, not just for me but for the team. I wouldn’t say I’m playing happy, but I’m playing. When I’m playing I am professional and I am always giving all I can, whether that be for club or country. I’m sure there’ll be plenty more turbulence, to be honest. I suppose it is something you will have to speak to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> about and it’s between me and them, and we will have to come to some sort of conclusion<br /><br /><b>[The winger, who is in line to start Wales’ crucial Euro 2020 qualifier with Azerbaijan on Friday, dismissed the notion it has been the most difficult period of his career]</b> Coming back to pre-season, I just kept my head down and I know there was a lot of talk, with people saying the good, bad, or whatever they wanted. It wasn’t the worst time of my career. It has been not ideal, but I know how to deal with it and it’s about keeping your head down.

We know what a great team they are, they had a great World Cup and they have shown year after year how good they actually are.

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale named in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> squad after Wales banner controversy]</b> I think a lot of noise is made with Gareth Bale’s gesture and what needs to be done is to focus on football, me as a coach and he as a player. It’s too much already. The player has left with the national team, he has been able to play and we got him back. I only look at sports performance, not what is said outside. I am not interested in the outside. I’ll always say the same. When you look at what he has given this club, and its fans, the ones who come to the stadium know that he is one of our own, and the fans must be on his side. I think he can be a decisive player. I only think about that. If something does not happen to him, he is a very important player. When something happens to him, of course, like when he is injured, it changes. I am going to count on Bale</p>

The Welsh flag was there and you can never turn down the Welsh flag. Wherever I am on a football pitch I will give 100 percent whether I’m in Wales or Madrid. I think the first time it (the boos) happened it was a bit of a shock and I didn’t know how to deal with it. But as I’ve got older and it’s happened one or two more times, you understand how to deal with it and you kind of shrug it off. In a way it’s a kind of respect to show the best players that you get whistled if you don’t perform, which I understand. So I just have to keep working hard, keep proving again to the fans what I can do and eventually the whistles do stop and you can get on with you career</p>

  <p><b>[‘Tottenham fan’ Bale looks back on Spurs’ Champions League heartbreak]</b> Everybody loves tuning in to watch the Champions League final, and obviously <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were there so I had a very keen interest, I was hoping they’d get to the final like they did. They had some great matches on the way, obviously in the semi-final <b>[against Ajax]</b>. For us <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans it was a bit disappointing in the final, but you have to look at the bigger picture. They did great to get there and gave a good account of themselves<br /><br /><b>[For Bale, though, scoring and beating <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to clinch La Decima six years ago remains his favourite]</b> They all have their own special moments. The first one is always so special because I’d never won a trophy before and you don’t know the experience, excitement and euphoria you get from lifting the trophy. Winning in my home city was an incredible moment for me personally because not many people get to do that. Then the last final <b>[against Liverpool]</b> I played in I scored that goal and for it to be the winning goal was also special. It’s difficult to pick one but in terms of the overall experience I’d go for the first one because it was the first final and I didn’t expect what was coming, the nerves of it and how we won it in the last minute. The celebrations were something I’d never experienced before. Everything was just new, so it was really exciting and it made it so special<br /><br />It’s quite a strict lockdown, we can’t go out at all, can’t go out for a walk or exercise or anything. It’s very strict, but I guess we’re all doing it for the greater good. Everyone wants to play football, but the most important thing is everyone stays safe, we don’t come back too early and we make sure everything is done safely so we avoid the second wave of this virus. The difficult thing, you hear everyone saying they want to get the season finished and do this and that. But you need to look at the bigger picture, the most important thing is everyone’s health. With football, everyone misses it and wants to play, everyone wants to watch. But the bigger picture is there will be many more seasons of football, Champions Leagues, leagues and cups, the important thing is getting this right now, if we can get that right, it’ll make football last much longer in the future and we won’t have a problem like this in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid star Bale reveals interest in future <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> move]</b> I really like the league, it’s grown so much over the years. The standard’s getting a lot better, clubs are improving, facilities and stadiums are improving. When we come over and play in pre-season the games are difficult…it’s a league that’s on the up and still rising. A lot more players want to come to America now. I would definitely be interested in it.<br /><br />I loved my time at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the fans were incredible, the club treated me amazingly.

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has hit out at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans who have jeered him during his time with the Primera Division club]</b> It’s one of those things. I didn’t know too much about it coming to Madrid. It’s one of those things that you don’t expect. You don’t expect your own supporters to do that to their own player. I get it if it is aimed at the team if you’re not playing well or at half-time you’re down by a couple. But to boo your own player, or whistle your own player like they do it’s just wrong. Because if you are having a bad game you want your fans to get behind you. If they start whistling your confidence goes down even more - everything becomes more difficult. You’re going to play worse, which is going to make them more angry. They are hurting themselves in a way. To me, it makes no sense. It baffles me to this day. I just don’t understand, it doesn’t make any sense to me<br /><br />I’d seen the banner a few weeks before. The boys had shown me and they said: ‘If we do qualify, let’s try and find it and bring it out.’ I was like: ‘Do what you want but I won’t be going over to get it’. They brought it down, we were all celebrating as a team and I’m not going to not jump around with my team-mates. It was a bit of banter. A bit of fun. People can see it how they like</p>

I’ve talked about it many times and everyone thinks it’s fine, but especially in the media there is that perception that I should be resting, that it can lead to injuries. I see people in America, for example Stephen Curry, who plays the same morning of the game. Here, if I play two days before the game it’s like: ‘What are you doing?’</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans jeering him has hurt his confidence]</b> We get a lot of pressure every game. If you don’t play well, there’s scrutiny. I’ve had 80,000 people in a stadium whistle at me because I haven’t played well. I’ve had it a few times! It’s not nice and it doesn’t do your confidence any good either<br /><br /><b>[When asked why they do it]</b> This is the biggest question and I just don’t get it. You would expect that if you’re not having a good time on the pitch, your fans would get behind you and try to help you do better because it’ll make them happy. But it seems that they do the opposite. They whistle you, which consequentially makes you feel worse, you lose your confidence, you play worse and then that makes them even more upset<br /><br />In football, you might play amazing, not score for five games, and then everyone says you’re having a terrible time. You think to yourself that you’re playing well, you just haven’t scored or assisted. But people just like goals, assists and ‘wow’ things. Sometimes that doesn’t always happen.<br /><br /><b>[Bale says he is also still confused that his love for playing golf has caused such a stir in Spain]</b> A lot of people have problems with me playing golf. I don’t know what their reason is because I’ve spoken to doctors and everybody’s fine with it. The media has this perception that it’s not good for me, you should be resting, it can cause you injuries. Steph Curry (NBA basketball player) plays maybe on the morning of a game. If I play two days before a game, it’s like ‘what’s he doing?’. It’s nice to be on the course and just get away from everything. I play with a few friends or sometimes play on my own, put some music on, play 18 holes and just relax and get away from everything. I then don’t have to think about football, especially if it’s not going well.</p>
