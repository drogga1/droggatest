The difference is decidedly favourable to the English referee. Instead of the excessive and irritating use of the whistle some local officials make, Caswell used it sparingly, and let certain infractions pass that were of little importance because he used the discretion allowed by the rulebook.</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina’s controversial friendly against Israel has been suspended after threats towards Lionel Messi and waves of protests]</b> The Israeli embassy is sad to announce the suspension of the match between the Israel and Argentina national teams scheduled for Saturday June 9, as a warm-up for the Russia World Cup. The threats and provocations directed at Lionel Messi, which logically aroused the solidarity of his colleagues and fear of playing the friendly, are no strangers to the daily life of Israel’s civilian population whose sporting stars, to put it simply, have been on numerous occasions the targets of violence and attacks. The friendship between Argentina and Israel, which will soon celebrate its 70th anniversary, is not about a football match. The democratic country and plural state <b>[composed of Jews, Muslims and Christians]</b>, will always eagerly await the chance to receive one of the stars of Argentine sport.</p>
