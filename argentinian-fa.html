Who is Brazil vs Argentina referee Roddy Zambrano? Roddy Zambrano will be the referee in charge of a blockbuster Copa America semi-final clash between Brazil and Argentina on Tuesday. The Ecuadorian has been FIFA listed since 2012 and began his career in Ecuador’s Serie A competition. At 41, Zambrano has already officiated 250 senior games, dishing out 1203 yellow cards and 60 reds during that span</p>

Barcelona star Lionel Messi tried his best to steal the show but a poor overall performance from Argentina has seen Brazil triumph 2-0 in their Copa America semi-final</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Argentina football authorities have weighed in on the controversy surrounding the officiating in their Copa America semi-final defeat to Brazil on Tuesday night. The Albiceleste were seen off 2-0 by the Selecao in Belo Horizonte after goals by Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino scotched their hopes of advancing to a third straight final of the South American showpiece] We saw the same thing as you. Thanks to our players for their unconditional effort</p>

Conmebol has confirmed problems with the VAR system used in Brazil’s controversial Copa America semi-final win over Argentina, with reports that Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro’s security team were to blame for communication issues. The South American continental governing body has insisted that the problems were fixed before kick-off in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Argentina’s fury at their Copa 2019 exit prompted reports they could play in UEFA, a suggestion which has been swiftly denied by the governing body] There is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion that Argentina has been asked to participate in UEFA competitions, nor to become a member of UEFA. UEFA has never entered into any discussions on this matter and would never do so. However, in the spirit of friendship and camaraderie and as an inclusive organisation, UEFA will, of course, invite Argentina as special guests to watch any UEFA competition at any time</p>

Lionel Messi has been suspended from Argentina’s next three matches and given a $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his controversial comments made during the Copa America</p>

<h4 id="2019-07-24-retrieve">2019 07 24 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[After being sent off against Chile, Messi skipped the Copa America medal ceremony, clearly still upset about his red card in the third-place game and what transpired in his nation’s semi-final defeat to host country Brazil] There is no doubt, the whole thing is set up for Brazil. I hope the VAR and referees don’t play any part in the final and that Peru can compete but it looks tough to me. I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America. We could have gone further but we weren’t allowed into the final. Corruption, referees and all the rest stopped people from enjoying the football</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Lionel Messi’s inflammatory comments claiming that there was corruption within the federation relating to the Copa America tournament. CONMEBOL responded to Messi’s comments with a withering statement of their own] In football sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and accepting the outcome of a match with loyalty and respect is a fundamental pillar of fair play. Same goes to the refereeing decisions, that are human and will never be perfect. Said accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the football players involved and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been tirelessly working to professionalise and develop South American football</p>

  <p>[Lionel Scaloni will take charge of Argentina in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup] The executive committee of the AFA decided to give continuity during the next qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar that will begin next year, to the selection project headed by Lionel Scaloni.</p>
