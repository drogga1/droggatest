  <p><b>[Former U.S. men’s national team defender Oguchi Onyewu says that the current American player pool is stronger than previous years on a player-by-player basis]</b> Very promising. I would say that because of the progression and the growth of the modern player, I think individually all these players are potentially better than all of the other individual players from previous years. I would say what they lack is the collective ability that former national teams had. They don’t have that identity, they don’t have that cohesiveness as a team. But if you take each individual player you’d be like, ‘Oh wow, this player is playing here, this guy is playing here.’ They’re there. They have the technical ability. So now how do you take individuals and make it a unit? That’s going to be their main challenge<br /><br />I’d say Bruce because we were ranked No. 2 or No. 3, right? There were great player pools for all of them. Jurgen definitely opened the floodgates for foreign-born American citizens, so it was kind of a curveball for the whole player pool in essence. The player pool under Jurgen was a lot broader, but even though it was broader, it wasn’t as encompassing as it could have been or should have been. The Latin influence in the team is still lacking, which is crazy because of the Latin influence we have in this country, but not The men’s team level. The players just aren’t there yet, for whatever reason</p>
