  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star Vidal frustrated over alleged unpaid bonuses]</b> I’m not in charge of that - that’s why I have my agent, my lawyer, who takes care of the awards and stuff. It seems unfair to me if money is missing, but it is an issue that is alien to what we are experiencing today<br /><br />It’s a subject I said when I arrived here that I’ll talk about it when I’m there <b>[in Spain]</b>. I’m on holiday and I just want to talk about what’s going on here</p>

  <p><b>[It was reported in December 2018 that the 31-year-old had become frustrated with a lack of action at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, and matters reached a head when he posted an angry emoji on Instagram after being left out of a Champions League match with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at Wembley]</b> There was a little bit of annoyance, but it’s in the past. A player always wants to play and to be important. You come here to contribute, not to cause problems in such an important team.<br /><br />It was a little bit of a heated thing, but it’s in the past. I’m only thinking about working, doing things well and winning titles. I try to do what the coach wants and give what I know from my career. I can steal balls, attack and defend, and give my best. Some people get confused and aren’t sure what it is I do. There aren’t many midfielders who can do what I can, which is to go box to box. This is good for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Vidal hits back at former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>’s alcohol claims]</b> People have focused on the worst things <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> said. I don’t see why one should say those things, it annoyed me. But he also said that I was a champion. He called me and explained to me. I didn’t do anything I couldn’t do. I was allowed to go out. I am a human being like everyone else. I work hard and if friends meet for an asado <b>[social event]</b> with the club’s permission, I’ll go too. If I have to stay focused, I do it, but when it’s my turn to have fun I take advantage of it, I’m just like the others. When I was wrong, I paid and got up. In football there are codes</p>

Now I am more prepared than ever. I am happy, there is a good group and I have great friends in the dressing room<br /><br />I feel very well physically, better than ever.

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s Vidal targeting ninth consecutive title when <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> resumes]</b> These 11 games are going to be 11 finals, we are all clear about that, and that they will be very difficult. We have to trust ourselves, we have to think about winning and also doing it in the best way. It would be a dream to win nine leagues in a row, because achieving a record with that many titles is very difficult. I still feel good and will continue fighting and winning trophies. Few players in history have done this and I’m proud. I hope to win the 9th here with Barca<br /><br />For us, it is very important that Luis and the other injured players recover, because it will be two intense months with many games to play in a short space of time. We need to be at 100 per cent for the two competitions we have left. I know the players are all well and have a great desire to win. We have all come back to training in very good physical condition, having prepared at home. We can’t all be together yet, but hopefully soon<br /><br />It was an incredible joy to return to training, those two months being locked up were quite long. You enjoy it a lot more when you’re on the pitch with your team-mates, it’s a very nice experience. Now we are coming back and are doing very well <b>[in training]</b>, but we are facing some very important months ahead. It was exciting to come back after what happened. With team-mates … there was a lot of happiness and a lot of conversation at a distance, trying to understand if each one of us has had the virus</p>

Here I am happy and I have excellent teammates, but I want to feel important. Otherwise, I will have to look for something else to continue my career. I like playing, I don’t say all the games, but the most difficult and important ones to win the titles<br /><br /><b>[The Chilean added on <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s reported interest in him at Inter]</b> We have an excellent relationship, he knows that I am a winner and that he can trust me.

  <p><b>[Vidal says It’s very difficult to even want to go on the pitch without <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fans]</b> It’s strange and complicated, from the things we have to do before games to the fixed protocols, as they are things you couldn’t imagine before. People gave you feelings we don’t have now before we even got to the stadium. Now the atmosphere has changed completely. You don’t have the motivation of your fans and it’s very difficult to concentrate or, even, to want to go on the pitch. Football is about the atmosphere its fans create<br /><br /><b>[Vidal acknowledges the fact that the reigning Spanish champions will have to raise their game to keep pace with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> It will be a very intense and very hard game and we have to improve because Athletic are very complicated. We have to recover as soon as possible between matchdays<br /><br />If we beat <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, it’ll be one-legged games and I like that because you’re playing for it all in 90 minutes.

But I think we are in perfect condition to be champions. The great atmosphere among the team is an important factor. We have all become close friends and that helps on the field. It’s very important because it really shows. I’m happy<br /><br /><b>[Vidal is excited about the way the Champions League will finish]</b> I like the format. If we can beat <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> it’s going to be very odd because of how and where it’s happening, in August and over single legs. But all-or-nothing games are the ones I like the best. I want to be important in those games</p>
