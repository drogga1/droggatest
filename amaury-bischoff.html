  <p><b>[Amaury Bischoff - Arsenal’s gamble which never paid off]</b> Playing for Arsenal is something every players dreams of. When I was a child a dreamed of playing for such a club. I made seven appearances for the first team and it was a great feeling. The whole club is fantastic and I enjoyed playing with those players. It was a dream come true to wear the Arsenal shirt and it was an overwhelming feeling to play together with all those players. I follow every game. I’m interested in football in general, and I follow every league. But of course, Arsenal is a bit more important for me.<br /><br />When I came to Arsenal I was injured and it took me two months to be back on pitch. But the rehab there was great, they did everything for me. I didn’t have any pressure and it was arranged with Arsene Wenger this way. Yes, we still have contact sometimes. When Arsenal played the German teams in the Champions League in recent years I was in the hotel and talked to him. We still have a good relationship although we don’t talk each day. But I see him once or twice in a year<br /><br />It wasn’t easy <b>[to decide to leave]</b>, because I was injured. But I came back and gave it all. Then the question came up whether to stay or to leave. I talked to Wenger and then we decided that it might be better to leave the club, because I wanted go play more games for the first team.<br /><br />I wasn’t injured that often, they only heavy injury was at Arsenal. Three years ago I had a mental coach because I received three red cards in three months. This helped me a lot and certainly could be a good solution for other players, because football is very often just about what is going on in your head<br /><br />I am feeling good right now even though I’ve only been here for a short time. It’s getting better day by day. I received a warm welcome here and I am happy. We want to get 45 points first and stay in the 3. Liga but our aim for the future is promotion for the 2. Bundesliga. The conditions here are great and this club belongs to 2. Bundesliga</p>

  <p><b>[Amaury Bischoff says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has lost its aura since <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> left in 2018]</b> Of course I still follow <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Every week I watch <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and see how they do. But now <b>[under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>]</b> is not like it was 10 years ago. For me, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> without <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> is not the same. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> without <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> is not Arsenal<br /><br />We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place<br /><br /><b>[the midfielder says <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s departure after 21 years and Emery’s arrival means the club does not have the same stature across Europe anymore]</b> It’s a very different time now. It’s not the big <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> like it was when I was there. I can understand why <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> made a change with the manager, but for me it doesn’t stay the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I knew without Wenger</p>

  <p><b>[Amaury Bischoff was described as a gamble on talent by <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> when he signed for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2008]</b> It was an amazing time for me. The city, the club. It was amazing. I made a lot of friends and I played with very big players. I know I could have done better, but I look back at it as an amazing experience. There are no regrets, never<br /><br />As a little kid it was a dream to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I am French as well and a lot of big French players had played there. It was an amazing day when <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> told me he wanted me<br /><br />I knew I was a gamble because I had been injured for eight months. But for me that was not a problem because I knew the quality I had when I was on the pitch. I just wanted to get back so I could show I had the quality to play at Arsenal<br /><br />It was not easy at first. I was staying at the training ground Monday to Friday and then for the weekend I would go back to France, which was good for my head. During the week I was working with the personal trainer. It was very difficult but players like <a href="emmanuel-adebayor.html">Emmanuel Adebayor</a>, <a href="gael-clichy.html">Gael Clichy</a> and <a href="bacary-sagna.html">Bacary Sagna</a> were very good to me. I knew <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was on my side as well and that was very important for me. I still felt like part of the squad. <a href="william-gallas.html">William Gallas</a>, <a href="kolo-toure.html">Kolo Toure</a>, <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>, they were all amazing guys. They talked with me like I was a normal player, it didn’t matter if I was injured. They gave me good motivation to carry on which was very important because when you are injured, it’s difficult. You need your family and your team-mates to help you and my team-mates were amazing<br /><br />It was the right decision for me to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I wanted to play every week at a good level, but at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> it was difficult because in midfield there was <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Wilshere</a>, <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a>, <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Fabregas</a>, <a href="tomas-rosicky.html">Rosicky</a>, they were all big players in the world. So it was very difficult for me to get minutes. I spoke with Arsene and we thought it was OK for me to leave. I had no problem with that. My relationship with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was amazing, he was like a friend and I am still in contact with him now. He was an amazing coach and man</p>
