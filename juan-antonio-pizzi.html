  <p><b>[The Chile manager, Juan Antonio Pizzi speaks of the fatigue factor and was looking forward to a short break before the tournament concludes in St Petersburg]</b> First we need to rest. We will see how the players recover and then make our decisions depending on that. Now we have three days to recover, rest and properly plan for the game on Sunday</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Is that goal against Atletico still appearing in your dreams twenty-two years later?]</b> The truth is… yes! It was a very special goal for me and for Barcelona. It was an honour to score, a great emotion, something undeniable and unforgettable today.<br /><br /><b>[When <b>[Bobby]</b> Robson gave you the signal to go onto the field, what went through your head?]</b> We wanted to get into the game and then come back, we did not want to be in such a humiliating situation, we were playing as a home team. After the words of Bobby Robson at half-time we came out very strong, with great enthusiasm to reverse the result and that transmitted to the stands<br /><br /><b>[In the middle of the comeback <b>[Milinko]</b> Pantic scored Atletico’s fourth to make it 4-2. How did you feel?]</b> It was a hard blow for all of us. We had been fighting for a long time and thinking we could get closer then Pantic scored. But we never stopped trusting each other and we had a very offensive team with great skill and technique. That allowed us to confront ourselves and play at our best<br /><br /><b>[At what point did you think the comeback was possible? Or is it that you never stopped believing?]</b> The ‘click’ was at the start of the second half. There we showed energy despite having conceded three goals. The fans were encouraging a lot, there was a lot of fervour, and we began to believe that it was possible<br /><br /><b>[The supporters, who usually leave early during midweek games, stayed until the end that day. What impact did that have on the pitch?]</b> It was usual to see a lot of the crowd attending the stadium leave before the end of the game but that day they all stayed and put a lot of pressure on the rival team. The supporters ended up being decisive to the win at the Camp Nou<br /><br /><b>[And at the moment in which <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola puts the cross to the area, what were you thinking?]</b> The forwards always believe that the ball will fall to us and that we are going to score a goal. I remember that Abelardo Fernández headed the ball and, despite being surrounded, I fell into a perfect position and I was lucky to get that fifth goal. We always had the hope that the conditions were favourable for the comeback<br /><br /><b>[Pantic still does not believe it. A few months ago he told me that that day ‘football was not fair’. Can you talk about injustice after a 5-4 game?]</b> Not at all, I understand what Pantic means, in his personal situation, a match of such importance and in which he gets four goals for his team and does not qualify, it is not easy to take. But when you combine it with what happened in the <b>[first leg at the]</b> Vicente Calderón means no one can argue that we progressed in a fair way. We played a very good game at Atletico and then what happened at the Camp Nou happened<br /><br /><b>[You returned to Barcelona as a coach with Valencia in 2014, where the fans showed they had not forgotten you. Valencia won 3-2 that day with a young Paco Alcacer scoring the winner. Are you surprised with how he is performing at Borussia Dortmund?]</b> He is exploiting his qualities in Dortmund, a team where he has more opportunities to play than in Barcelona. The more he plays, the more he gains confidence and increases his performance. He is a young boy who still has things to prove and things to do, but he is at an ideal club to achieve it<br /><br /><b>[Will Valencia qualify the Champions League at the end of the season?]</b> It’s going to be quite complicated, I think that Valencia had a period in which they did not achieve good results. Now they have recovered their best form. I really do not know if they will qualify for the Champions League but they have to try<br /><br /><b>[And finally, can Valencia surprise Barcelona in the final of the Copa del Rey?]</b> They have evolved as a team, they have grown, that is obvious, but we will have to work very hard to achieve a surprise against Barcelona. They can do it but it will not be easy</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Antonio Pizzi says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> will draw the crowds in their droves despite fears over ticket sales for the Supercopa de Espana in Saudi Arabia]</b> I have no doubt. They’re aware of how much it means to have the four best teams in Spain and four of the best in the world. It’s exceptional for them, like a party. Also, you have to keep in mind <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is there, who’s a person they admire and recognise, so seeing him on the pitch will be a big deal for them. They fill grounds and love the sport. The level isn’t like Europe yet, and they know that, but that’s why they’re investing so much and it’s why they follow European football so much. Every weekend they watch <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and even the Bundesliga<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are a favourite in every competition they play. But it’s one match, so anything can happen. Atletico are a very strong team, too, and they’re hard to score against. It’s an attractive semi-final</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Antonio Pizzi says Lautaro like <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> &amp; best fit for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Lautaro is the prototypical example of how the position of centre-forward has changed in the modern game. I see a lot of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> in him. Lautaro has already demonstrated the qualities he has in Argentina with Racing and the national team. I think he is the ideal player; the style he has as a player is the one which best suits <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He also has an advantage in that he has performed at a very high level in the Italian league, which for me is one of the most competitive in the world. Any footballer who excels in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is able to do so anywhere.<br /><br /><b>[The absence of Uruguay international Suarez hitting the reigning Spanish champions hard]</b> Not only is his absence noticeable on the pitch, but I think Suarez has great leadership qualities, too. He has a commitment that is contagious towards his team-mates and brings out a greater level from the players around him, mainly <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Unfortunately, this injury has prevented Los Cules from maintaining their style of play that they showed when Suarez was fit</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Antonio Pizzi says <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> can still be very important for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> Alexis was in a perfect place at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and suddenly he changes city, coach, team-mates, fans <b>[by joining <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> … sometimes that adaptation happens quickly, sometimes it takes longer. In Alexis’s case, I think it took too long. He didn’t seem to be able to connect and emotionally he dropped. The consequences of that state of mind were translated in his performances. I don’t know what destiny holds for him but I think this experience in Italy, away from English football, might be good for him. I really hope so. I’m sure that if he can find tranquillity and his form, he’ll be very important for United</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Antonio Pizzi on the late <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a>]</b> Robson would get names wrong and we’d be there shooting looks at each other, going along with it. But he was fundamental: he had to lead <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> through the hardest era in 20 years, making that post-Cruyff period as trauma-free as possible. That was his great virtue. He was old school, close to the players, and the lessons from him were not just about football, they were human. He was an exceptional person and whenever we meet up, we remember him fondly</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Antonio Pizzi says <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> is the future of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and will return]</b> I think he evaluated the situation very well - there is the fact that he would be coaching former team-mates - but also the fact that he would be going home perhaps without the experience of having managed in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. I think that led him to take the decision that he eventually took, to say: ‘Give me some time. I want to coach <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I think I’m prepared to do it but I think I have to develop myself a little bit more’. I am absolute convinced that the future of <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and the future of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will come together at one point, I don’t know if in two years or five years or eight years but <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> is going to be <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> coach, there is no doubt about that<br /><br />I don’t think that’s necessarily a determining factor but I do feel that each individual needs to feel ready for the challenge that he is about to take on. I don’t think he should take the job because of the needs of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in any given moment, such as when the club changed <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a> and there was a lot of talk that <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> could come in as coach</p>
