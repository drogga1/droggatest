  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Gelson Fernandes has revealed that it was his preference to stay in the Premier League in 2009]</b> I will never forget my time there. I didn’t want to leave the Premier League, but with Nigel de Jong, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure, Manchester City signed three new players for my position. There was no room for me there and a transfer within England wasn’t an option because City didn’t want to give me to a competitor. That’s how I ended up in Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne.<br /><br />I got to know many great personalities and top athletes during my time at Man City. Didi Hamann influenced me a lot. He was an incredibly clever player, had personality, charisma and was a real leader. He was also very important to me personally because he gave me a lot of tips that helped me a lot in the course of my career<br /><br /><b>[On Niko Kovac]</b> A few weeks ago he was still being praised because he had started the season so well. Then he didn’t win four games in a row and already there was a big crisis. I can imagine that the team were at a low point because the preparation was tough. Nevertheless, I’m sure that they will find their way to their old strength. Kovac knows what he wants and can show the team the right path. Of course, you don’t get much time at Bayern <b>[if there are bad results]</b>, but I’m convinced he can lead the club out of the crisis</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> midfielder Gelson Fernandes has said he believes the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> will be ready to return in late May]</b> When we come back, it will be behind closed doors. I think that will be in late May. It’s impossible to think that in June, July, August, we’d be playing in front of 50,000 people. That would be wrong<br /><br />It’s nice to be on the pitch but we are being careful - washing hands and everything - and we feel lucky, that’s the only way we can keep doing our jobs. Physically when I was on my own we had to do a lot of bike work and I didn’t lose much fitness. We are now training but it’s not the same as matches</p>
