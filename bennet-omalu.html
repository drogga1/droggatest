<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Roy Keane says if you’re worried about the physical side of any sport, then play chess]</b> Keane’s claim is a very irresponsible statement to make. If you notice the industries and corporations that are doing very well in today’s global economy are the information technology corporations. What is the denominator across these successful corporations? They are businesses that speak the truth, that elevate the truth, that provide human beings a platform to think and identify the truth.<br /><br />So when I see industries that intentionally deny or reject the truth, it’s a very dangerous strategy. It’s a dangerous strategy that could undermine the long-term sustainability of that industry. The soccer industry should stop denying the truth. They should say: soccer is not a high impact, high contact sport, but you could suffer brain injury in sports. You need to be aware of that. You need to play safe, like removing heading from play.<br /><br />We need to place the life of the player above the revenue streams. This boils down to money. It’s all about money. We should not place money above the value of life - even the life of one single player. The life of one single soccer player is worth more than the billions of dollars the soccer industry makes. Life should come first. I have never vouched for the ban of soccer.<br /><br />We need to make soccer compatible with 21st century knowledge. The soccer industry should embrace the future and stop living in the past. If they fail to do that, soccer will not be as successful as it is. People will develop healthier, more brain friendly types of sports. People may not want to believe that. <br /><br />We need to be progressive, we need to be intelligent. We cannot continue to play soccer the way we played it in 1970. If we continue to play soccer the way we did in 1970, then society will move ahead and leave soccer behind.<br /><br />Science has shown over the centuries that whenever the human head is exposed to repeated blows, there is a 100 per cent risk of brain damage. <br /><br />Knowing what we know today, there is no reason why a child today should be jumping up and slamming his head to try to stop a ball travelling at a high velocity. That is silly. No matter how much we may be in love with soccer, the question we need to ask ourselves is: which is more important, the life of a child or the excitement of soccer?<br /><br />Which do we value more? Life or the fleeting moments of ecstasy? Obviously there is no question about it: life comes first.<br /><br />Children under the age of 18 should not be heading the ball. Children under the ages of 12 to 14 should not be playing soccer as we play it today because their brains are not sufficiently developed to handle soccer. They should play a new type of soccer that should be developed by the soccer leagues where there is less contact, less dribbling, less players and a bigger and lighter ball.<br /><br />If we refuse to acknowledge the truth of science, the long-term sustainability of soccer as an industry would be in doubt<br /><br /><b>[Omalu is certain that many, many more will be forced to follow Doyle’s lead]</b> The work I did in 2002, that autopsy I did on Mike Webster, that single event has transformed and revolutionised the sports industry as we know it.<br /><br />Sports can never be the same any more after the Mike Webster autopsy. Knowing what we know now, and since that autopsy, science has evolved. We now know more because other researchers across the world confirmed what the Mike Webster autopsy showed us.<br /><br />Knowing what we know today, we are smarter, more intelligent, more knowledgeable, more players will begin to come forward. We now know the science better. We will now reasonably identify the symptoms. With time, maybe in another five to 10 years, we may be able to diagnose the disease in living people. More and more players will begin to retire at younger ages and less and less children will be playing. That is the trend, I guarantee you that.<br /><br />Brain damage could develop in many ways. They develop dementia in later life, many of them lose their intelligence, they become less intelligent. When they retire from soccer, they don’t do so well. They cannot start new businesses. Many of them live very ordinary lives, they don’t get jobs<br /><br />Many of them become alcoholics, they become drug abusers. Many of them develop psychiatric illnesses like major depression. Many of them engage in violent behaviours and criminal behaviours. Many of them become more reclusive and introverted. We have always known this. Many of them develop memory disorders and lose the ability to acquire new information. It is not just about headaches.<br /><br />If you watch some of the players after retirement, once they retire, what happens, you don’t hear about them. Knowing what we know today, we need to pay closer attention</p>
