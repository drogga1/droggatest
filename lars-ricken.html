  <p><b>[Lars Ricken, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s academy coordinator, bit back over <a href="youssoufa-moukoko.html">Youssoufa Moukoko</a> age’s queries]</b> He is 12. That is simply a fact; there is no doubt about it. Youssoufa has now reached the age when he can play in the Under-19s. We see this age group for him as the right year, which corresponds to his performance</p>

  <p><b>[United States youth international Giovanni Reyna has signed with Borussia Dortmund. Reyna had been with New York City FC’s academy, but the 16-year-old departs the MLS club’s youth side to join the Bundesliga outfit]</b> Giovanni Reyna is the son of former Bundesliga player Claudio Reyna. He plays in central midfield and is without doubt a huge talent. We’re delighted that they’ve opted for Borussia Dortmund. Everyone at BVB is convinced that these two transfers show great promise</p>

  <p><b>[Lars Ricken says <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> don’t buy superstars, we create them]</b> The way we do things didn’t happen by accident, or by coincidence. It is a clear and obvious strategy not to buy superstars but to create them. <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> weren’t superstars when they came to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. We developed them to become superstars. It is very important for the club<br /><br />The reason the atmosphere in our stadium is so good is because there is a great identification between the players and the fans. The supporters see it is a gift for them to play in our stadium. We have signed some really good players but we also have young ones - <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is 19, Gio is 17. They are very light on their feet. It is great to see. Technical skills are very important. And the quickness and speed of action. Players in our first team are all so fast. It is unbelievable. A few months ago, we had a player from a foreign country who was playing for our Under-17s and he wasn’t fast enough, so we decided not to make the transfer. It made no sense. The other thing is the mentality. The loads we put on the players are very high. School, football, national teams. This can all take 70 or 80 hours a week. These boys have to be grown-up, focused and disciplined at a very young age</p>
