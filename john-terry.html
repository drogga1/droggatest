  <p><b>[Although this friendly is important for those looking to cement a place in the squad, it may also provide Eriksson the answer to who he should choose in the centre of defence]</b> It’s a chance to send Sven a message. There’s no bad time to play for England. It’s a busy part of the season, there’s no doubt about that. But every time you get called up for England it’s a very proud moment and it’s certainly something I look forward to every time… we work hard, train hard and try and impress the boss. There’s so much I want to achieve in the game and being on the plane to the World Cup is one of those achievements I want</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on Frank Lampard]</b> He is different class. He’s not just done it for one year and tailed off as we have seen a lot of players do. We have seen him for the past four, five, six years playing at a top level, scoring goals, passing brilliantly and working on things he’s not so good at in training. He works so hard on his shooting and his running off the ball.<br /><br />When we go on a warm-down, he’ll be doing laps around the field on his own. He is an inspiration to myself and everyone else in the team to push on and give it everything in our short careers.<br /><br />I can’t speak highly enough of the man. What he gives us in the dressing-room when things aren’t going well, what he gives out on the pitch and the stuff behind the scenes that people don’t get to see. He puts in a lot of hard work off the pitch and gets his rewards on it</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry on his early days at Chelsea]</b> I’d do anything for them. I’d make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. I used to clean Dennis Wise’s boots and he wanted them perfect, so I took really good care of them. Every now and then he gave me a little bonus. Every time he scored I was on £25, which was half my wages at the time. I used to be praying we’d get a penalty or he’d score. During training I would go in and win tackles against first-team players, and I remember at the time people were going, ‘Ooh, you can’t do that’. Sometimes – the foreign guys especially – didn’t like it. Dan Petrescu, once, he got me round the throat, and said, ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ The first one over to back me up was Wisey: ‘If you’ve got something to say, you say it to me, not the younger players’. Me and Dan laugh about it now</p>

They have become one of the most feared in Europe over recent years.

Now, they were very talented but very young individuals. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> didn’t have time to put them in the team or take out a Duff or <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> because we were winning every single week and his job is on the line. So, like I said before, if you come in and you are 10 or 20 per cent below the standard of Duff and <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a>, who were scoring 20 goals a season each, you are not going to make that team. No chance. Fair play to them <b>[that]</b> they’ve gone elsewhere and proved they’re good enough, but at that present time they were not good enough for Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry has hailed the incredible job overseen by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> at Chelsea]</b> The expectation level at the start wasn’t there but I think that has helped him as well. The whole football club has been lifted now because they know if they’re good enough under Frank and <b>[assistant]</b> Jody <b>[Morris]</b>, they’re going to get a chance. It’s excellent. It’s what the fans want to see. For so many years, I was really the last one to come through <b>[the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy]</b>. Frank will be watching every under-23 game, every under-18 game. The staff will have their fingers on the pulse and making sure, after an under-23 game, they’re in the dressing room telling the boys, ‘You’re not good enough’ or ‘You’re with me in training next day’. The impact that has on the academy is incredible. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> seem to be loved by a lot of people for the first time since I’ve known it. They are likeable. It’s great to see players get the opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he wants to take the reins somewhere in the near future]</b> Not yet. I’m happy. I have just signed a new contract. I’m really glad about what I have done in coming in and learning under someone like Dean at a big club like <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. For me, when the time is right, clearly I want to be a manager. Villa know that and Dean knows that as well but I am thoroughly enjoying learning from and watching Dean on a daily basis. I’m learning every single day</p>

I think <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is one of the best young players in the world at the moment, so he’d be a great addition to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s squad.

With <b>[assistant manager]</b> <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> as well, he has someone who knows the younger players and works with them at the youth team and U-18 level as well.

I just think the natural ability he’s got and that <a href="joe-cole.html">Joe Cole</a> had, a god-given talent that not many people are blessed with but he’s certainly got. The way he glides past people. He’s quick, but not many people know it - I don’t think he knows how quick he is. He’s a tremendous talent, he gets a lot of fouls in the Championship and now in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. People don’t know how to stop him<br /><br />You see a lot of players from the outside, but when you go to a club and you’re working with players on a daily basis, you just see how much of a huge talent he really is. I got to see that in glimpses. He got an injury to his rib in pre-season against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, and he missed a big chunk of that season - having Jack fully fit in my season there, I’m pretty sure we’d have gone up. Jack’s a phenomenal talent. It’s been a real pleasure to see him grow, work and develop over the last year, two years. He’s shown the whole world this season that he’s more than capable of playing at the top level<br /><br />There’s a side to Jack people don’t see. Jack’s there till 5, 6, 7 in the evening, he’s eating the right food and doing all his gym work. That’s all behind closed doors. He’s a top professional, wanting to get to the very top. I just hope he keeps improving with us and making us stronger because, with him, we’ve got a real chance</p>

It was one of those moments where there were whispers going around, we weren’t performing as well, we weren’t doing as well in the league, and then he came in and said: ‘That’s it, I’ve been sacked.’ He went around and gave everyone a hug and a cuddle. Full-grown men crying their eyes out. We were thinking: ‘Where do we go from here?’ We had someone like a father figure, guiding us. We actually spoke to the board and said: ‘Listen, we want him to stay, can we not bring him back? It’s a rash decision, he’s the best we’ve worked with’. Unfortunately, they’d made their decision. But yes, there were full-grown men in absolute tears. He was so demanding on the group, and he pushed us to our limits at times. It’s not until you finish playing that you realise why he did what he did.<br /><br />You’d be sitting there at 8pm at night, and you’d get a message from him: ‘How’s Toni and the kids? Tell Georgie and Summer I love them! How is school going?’ I thought, my God, I’ve never had that from a manager. I’d get in and sit next to Lamps and say: ‘Lamps I got a message from the manager last night,’ thinking I’m the special one. Lamps would say: ‘Yeah, so did I’, and Didier would say the same! Every now and again I’ll get a message or a picture or a video from him, just saying hello to the kids. My kids absolutely idolise him. And that’s because of the connect he has, that people probably don’t see from the outside world</p>
