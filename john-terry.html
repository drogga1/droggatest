  <p><b>[Although this friendly is important for those looking to cement a place in the squad, it may also provide Eriksson the answer to who he should choose in the centre of defence]</b> It’s a chance to send Sven a message. There’s no bad time to play for England. It’s a busy part of the season, there’s no doubt about that. But every time you get called up for England it’s a very proud moment and it’s certainly something I look forward to every time… we work hard, train hard and try and impress the boss. There’s so much I want to achieve in the game and being on the plane to the World Cup is one of those achievements I want</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> He is different class. He’s not just done it for one year and tailed off as we have seen a lot of players do. We have seen him for the past four, five, six years playing at a top level, scoring goals, passing brilliantly and working on things he’s not so good at in training. He works so hard on his shooting and his running off the ball.<br /><br />When we go on a warm-down, he’ll be doing laps around the field on his own. He is an inspiration to myself and everyone else in the team to push on and give it everything in our short careers.<br /><br />I can’t speak highly enough of the man. What he gives us in the dressing-room when things aren’t going well, what he gives out on the pitch and the stuff behind the scenes that people don’t get to see. He puts in a lot of hard work off the pitch and gets his rewards on it</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry on his early days at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I’d do anything for them. I’d make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. I used to clean <a href="dennis-wise.html">Dennis Wise</a>’s boots and he wanted them perfect, so I took really good care of them. Every now and then he gave me a little bonus. Every time he scored I was on £25, which was half my wages at the time. I used to be praying we’d get a penalty or he’d score. During training I would go in and win tackles against first-team players, and I remember at the time people were going, ‘Ooh, you can’t do that’. Sometimes - the foreign guys especially - didn’t like it. Dan Petrescu, once, he got me round the throat, and said, ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ The first one over to back me up was Wisey: ‘If you’ve got something to say, you say it to me, not the younger players’. Me and Dan laugh about it now</p>

I just want to get this season finished<br /><br />Chelsea will always be my club for sure but since I have been at Aston Villa, I have given my all and the fans have been superb with me. They have welcomed me with open arms and I like to think I have given back on the pitch and on the training field. It has been a good combination and worked well for both, I feel.

  <p><b>[Former England and Chelsea captain John Terry has announced his retirement from football]</b> After 23 incredible years as a footballer, I have decided now is the right time to retire from playing. I have many people to thank. My wife Toni and my two children, Georgie and Summer, for being my rocks throughout my career - I couldn’t have done it without you, I love you with all my heart. I thank my parents, Sue and Ted, for the sacrifices they made for me as a boy, giving me the best opportunity to fulfil my dreams and become a professional footballer. My brother, Paul, for his help and advice throughout my career - and all my family and friends for their great support. As a 14-year-old, I made my best and biggest decision: to sign for Chelsea Football Club. Words will never be enough to show how much everyone at the club means to me, in particular the fans. Right from the outset they have given me total support, on and off the pitch, and I have a tremendous bond with them. We achieved so many great memories together and I couldn’t have succeeded without you.<br /><br />To me you are the best fans in the world. I hope I have done you all proud wearing the shirt and the armband. I want to thank my amazing teammates, coaches, managers and backroom staff, who I was honoured to work with and learn from. They all sided me on my way to playing 717 games for the club I love and it was a privilege to serve them as captain. They also helped me achieve my boyhood dream of playing for an captaining England, of which I am immensely proud. My club career and heart will always belong to Chelsea, but I am grateful for my loan spell at Nottingham Forest in 1999, which was invaluable for my development as a young player. And I want to say a thank you to Aston Villa for giving me the opportunity to play at such big club and captain it throughout the 2017/18 season. It was a privilege to represent such renowned football club with great fans. I look forward to the next chapter in my life and the challenges ahead</p>

That side of it is huge for me, the depth and detail that goes into the meeting on a Monday or Tuesday morning. You’re thinking about the whole group.

Sometimes you come in and say: ‘I’ve nailed it,’ but you have to write it down. It’s a bit like being at school, constantly learning, and I’m like a sponge at the minute.

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend Terry names two clubs that bid for him during iconic career at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a> was manager of <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> accepted a bid and <b>[Gianluca]</b> <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Vialli</a> said no. Which obviously I’m very thankful to Luca for, he gave me my debut. Great man, great manager<br /><br />Then obviously the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> one, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> approached <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, made an offer official. Simple as this, I sat with the owner, face-to-face and said ‘I never want to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, that’s a fact. If you want to sell me then it’s a different story. But I’m telling you off the bat that I never want to leave this football club’. Within that, I was due a new contract, we shook hands on a new contract, agreed a deal and I stayed another five, six years after that’. Them two clubs were the only two that come in for me</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry has drawn comparisons between <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> and ex-Chelsea talisman <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, while expressing his hope that the <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> star stays put amid reported interest from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I think he’s similar to <a href="joe-cole.html">Joe Cole</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>. I just think the natural ability he’s got and that <a href="joe-cole.html">Joe Cole</a> had, a god-given talent that not many people are blessed with but he’s certainly got. The way he glides past people. He’s quick, but not many people know it - I don’t think he knows how quick he is. He’s a tremendous talent, he gets a lot of fouls in the Championship and now in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. People don’t know how to stop him<br /><br />You see a lot of players from the outside, but when you go to a club and you’re working with players on a daily basis, you just see how much of a huge talent he really is. I got to see that in glimpses. He got an injury to his rib in pre-season against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, and he missed a big chunk of that season - having Jack fully fit in my season there, I’m pretty sure we’d have gone up. Jack’s a phenomenal talent. It’s been a real pleasure to see him grow, work and develop over the last year, two years. He’s shown the whole world this season that he’s more than capable of playing at the top level<br /><br />There’s a side to Jack people don’t see. Jack’s there till 5, 6, 7 in the evening, he’s eating the right food and doing all his gym work. That’s all behind closed doors. He’s a top professional, wanting to get to the very top. I just hope he keeps improving with us and making us stronger because, with him, we’ve got a real chance</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain John Terry on <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>]</b> From a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> point of view, he was the one I hated playing against, he always seemed to score, whether at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> or the Bridge. He was the one player Roman would always ask about. Yossi <b>[Benayoun]</b> was close to him and told us ‘Fernando is on his way’. We were like, ‘no way’. We thought we were going to dominate <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Europe for the next five or six years. This is it. That was our thought from playing against him.</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry has admitted that he broke down in tears with the rest of his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mates after learning of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s sacking in 2007]</b> We were all in tears. It was one of those moments where there were whispers going around, we weren’t performing as well, we weren’t doing as well in the league, and then he came in and said: ‘That’s it, I’ve been sacked.’ He went around and gave everyone a hug and a cuddle. Full-grown men crying their eyes out. We were thinking: ‘Where do we go from here?’ We had someone like a father figure, guiding us. We actually spoke to the board and said: ‘Listen, we want him to stay, can we not bring him back? It’s a rash decision, he’s the best we’ve worked with’. Unfortunately, they’d made their decision. But yes, there were full-grown men in absolute tears. He was so demanding on the group, and he pushed us to our limits at times. It’s not until you finish playing that you realise why he did what he did.<br /><br />You’d be sitting there at 8pm at night, and you’d get a message from him: ‘How’s Toni and the kids? Tell Georgie and Summer I love them! How is school going?’ I thought, my God, I’ve never had that from a manager. I’d get in and sit next to Lamps and say: ‘Lamps I got a message from the manager last night,’ thinking I’m the special one. Lamps would say: ‘Yeah, so did I’, and Didier would say the same! Every now and again I’ll get a message or a picture or a video from him, just saying hello to the kids. My kids absolutely idolise him. And that’s because of the connect he has, that people probably don’t see from the outside world</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea defender John Terry has revealed that he practised Panenkas in training for two weeks before slipping during a Champions League final penalty shoot-out defeat to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2008]</b> On the build-up to finals you take penalties, and you go through the routines, and you do the walk from the halfway line. We’d been doing that for two weeks at the training ground, and I’d been dinking them down the middle like the panenka!</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry has admitted that his father initially didn’t want him to sign for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as the former Blues defender said his family tried to push him to join <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I had the option between <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and to be fair all of them went above and beyond. The moment I walked into <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it just felt right. I know that’s going to sound really bizarre.<br /><br />Again, my dad never wanted me to sign for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Actually, on the pitch of me signing my schoolboy form at the club, my dad refused to go on the pitch with me. I’m in the tunnel, the players are coming off the pitch and I’m waiting in the tunnel, <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Glenn Hoddle</a> goes past and my dad’s going, ‘You’re not signing for this football club, we should sign for Manchester United’.<br /><br />Again, me being me at the time I’m going, ‘I’m 100 per cent I’m signing here, if you don’t come out with me I’m going out to sign’. You needed a parent, so my mum said she would come and sign it with me, my dad’s going mad at my mum, ‘No you wont’.<br /><br />There’s a picture of my mum and Graham Rix signing my contract, but my dad refused and absolutely kicked off that night. Again, me being the character I was, I knew <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was right for me<br /><br />One night that was probably supposed to be one of the best nights of my life turned out to be a tough one for a young 14-year-old to be honest. I just knew and loved <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> from the moment I walked in and never looked back, I still love the club and look out for every result now.</p>
