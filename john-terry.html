  <p><b>[Although this friendly is important for those looking to cement a place in the squad, it may also provide Eriksson the answer to who he should choose in the centre of defence]</b> It’s a chance to send Sven a message. There’s no bad time to play for England. It’s a busy part of the season, there’s no doubt about that. But every time you get called up for England it’s a very proud moment and it’s certainly something I look forward to every time… we work hard, train hard and try and impress the boss. There’s so much I want to achieve in the game and being on the plane to the World Cup is one of those achievements I want</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> He is different class. He’s not just done it for one year and tailed off as we have seen a lot of players do. We have seen him for the past four, five, six years playing at a top level, scoring goals, passing brilliantly and working on things he’s not so good at in training. He works so hard on his shooting and his running off the ball.<br /><br />When we go on a warm-down, he’ll be doing laps around the field on his own. He is an inspiration to myself and everyone else in the team to push on and give it everything in our short careers.<br /><br />I can’t speak highly enough of the man. What he gives us in the dressing-room when things aren’t going well, what he gives out on the pitch and the stuff behind the scenes that people don’t get to see. He puts in a lot of hard work off the pitch and gets his rewards on it</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry on his early days at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I’d do anything for them. I’d make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. I used to clean <a href="dennis-wise.html">Dennis Wise</a>’s boots and he wanted them perfect, so I took really good care of them. Every now and then he gave me a little bonus. Every time he scored I was on £25, which was half my wages at the time. I used to be praying we’d get a penalty or he’d score. During training I would go in and win tackles against first-team players, and I remember at the time people were going, ‘Ooh, you can’t do that’. Sometimes - the foreign guys especially - didn’t like it. Dan Petrescu, once, he got me round the throat, and said, ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ The first one over to back me up was Wisey: ‘If you’ve got something to say, you say it to me, not the younger players’. Me and Dan laugh about it now</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry would be prepared to see out the remainder of his Chelsea contract without playing another game if it guaranteed the club success]</b> First and foremost the team is flying, playing unbelievable. Sometimes there’s nothing you can do as a player. I started the first four games of the season and get injured and we lose at home to Liverpool and Arsenal away and the manager is asking ‘how long till you are back?’. And then we go 13 games unbeaten and you’re back fit but you can’t get in. And as a player it’s difficult to accept but you have to accept it. When you’ve got a manager like Conte who’s been honest with me from day one ‘listen you’re not getting back, in the boys are playing great the team’s flying’, you haven’t got a leg to stand on. I genuinely mean when I say it, but for me I am honestly hoping I don’t play this season which means they keep winning. Do you get that from a player that’s been here five years? I don’t think you do. Do you get that from a player who plays but moaning every week? I’ve not moaned once. I’m training unbelievably, you have to, you do things the right way because the love of the club and how much you respect the club and how good the club has been to you over the years.<br /><br />I think the love I have for the club I’m hoping I can be back here, in whatever, a year, two years, this year, I really don’t know. It’s something I want to do, go into my badges, be an ambassador for the club. When I think of Chelsea I think of Lamps, Ash <b>[Cole]</b>, Didier <b>[Drogba]</b></p>

We both appreciate and understand that it’s important to get our coaching badges. It’s important to go out and gain the experience, whether that’s in the youth, reserves or other teams at Chelsea or at other football clubs. If we get to come back in 10 or 15 years and be at the peak of our careers as managers and do a great job, that would be unbelievable.<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte]</b> He’s got new ideas and it’s been great for me working with him towards the end of my career.

From coaches, team-mates and staff to the fans who have given me so much support down the years, I can’t thank you enough. There will be opportunities for me to speak further about this over the coming weeks. I will decide on my future in due course, but for now I am committed to helping the team achieve success this season.<br /><br />The club and I have always had a fantastic relationship, which will continue beyond my playing days. We had some really positive talks but with everything taken into careful consideration I have decided it’s the right time for me to leave. I’ve always been conscious that I depart at the right time, in the right way, and I feel that the end of this season is the right time for the club and I<br /><br />I feel I still have plenty to offer on the pitch but understand that opportunities here at Chelsea will be limited for me.

I would like to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart for the unbelievable support you’ve shown me over the years. You mean the world to me and every trophy we’ve won during my time at the club we’ve won together. I will never forget the incredible journey we’ve been on. Thank you so much for everything</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry sends heartfelt thank you letter to Chelsea fans]</b> It’s with overwhelming emotion that earlier this week the club and I announced this will be my last season as a Chelsea player. This has been the toughest decision of my life for me and my family​, but I always envisaged leaving on the right terms, in the right way and at the right time - and that is now. I feel I still have regular football in me but understand that opportunities here at Chelsea will be limited, it is therefore time for a new challenge.<br /><br />My earliest ambition as a boy was to become a professional footballer and I’m eternally grateful to Chelsea FC, my mum, dad and brother for giving me the opportunity and their total support to fulfill that dream. From joining as a schoolboy at 14, to signing my first professional contract at 17 and then making my first-team debut in the same year, to then be​ing​ part of the transformation and evolution of this great football club, has inspired me to keep striving to be the very best I can be.<br /><br />With the backing and support of Mr Abramovich, we as players have been given the opportunity to fulfill all our professional desires​, as this club moved into a new era where it matched our ambitions and became one of the biggest and most successful clubs in the world. For this I’d like to thank Mr Abramovich personally, and the board who have worked tirelessly to ensure the club continues to develop both on and off the field.<br /><br />For 22 years this club has been my life, it has given me the platform to compete against the best, break record after record, win trophy after trophy​,​ and as we won more it only increased my desire to work harder and demand more from myself and the team. With this obsession I’ve been able to become Chelsea’s most successful captain and I’m immensely proud to be mentioned in the same company as Ron Harris, Peter Bonetti, Frank Lampard, John Hollins and many other greats as one of the highest appearance-makers for the club.<br /><br />Thank you to all my team-mates and managers over the years. To have gone shoulder to shoulder in many a battle with you has been an honour.<br /><br />I would like to thank my beautiful family for the unconditional love and support they’ve shown me. To my wife Toni and kids Georgie and Summer, you have been my rocks throughout my career. I love you so much and thank you. You’ve celebrated with me when we’ve won and supported me when we’ve lost. You’ve given me the platform to continue to chase my dream over all these years at Stamford Bridge and pushed me to want to be the best throughout. We did it all together. Our family will always be Blue and proud.<br /><br />I’ll never be able to put into words the love I have for you fans. The support you have always given me​,​ both personally and to the team​, is phenomenal. You’ve been instrumental in my success and have inspired me and the team to win so many trophies.<br /><br />Wearing the armband and being your captain has been without doubt one of the proudest achievements of my life. I only hope I’ve been able to repay you with my commitment and loyalty throughout my career​,​ and I ​look forward to returning to this great club in some capacity in the future.<br /><br />I want to stress that the journey is not yet over. There is a long way to go and we are committed to ending this campaign on a high. I am fully focused on helping the team and manager in every way I can from now until the end of the season</p>

Manchester City have already made one big signing in Bernardo Silva, so we need to act fast. I am sure the club will do the same and the manager has stressed that himself.

But naturally there are going to be more games next year so the squad needs improving, and a bit more strength in depth. Seeing from a different perspective, from my point of view, it’s been good to see certain people stand up to the plate - at half-time against Arsenal, and in other big games when we’ve been losing - and really show they can step into the shoes that I, Frank <b>[Lampard]</b>, Didier <b>[Drogba]</b>, Ashley <b>[Cole]</b> and Petr <b>[Cech]</b> have left.

  <p><b>[Former England and Chelsea captain John Terry has announced his retirement from football]</b> After 23 incredible years as a footballer, I have decided now is the right time to retire from playing. I have many people to thank. My wife Toni and my two children, Georgie and Summer, for being my rocks throughout my career - I couldn’t have done it without you, I love you with all my heart. I thank my parents, Sue and Ted, for the sacrifices they made for me as a boy, giving me the best opportunity to fulfil my dreams and become a professional footballer. My brother, Paul, for his help and advice throughout my career - and all my family and friends for their great support. As a 14-year-old, I made my best and biggest decision: to sign for Chelsea Football Club. Words will never be enough to show how much everyone at the club means to me, in particular the fans. Right from the outset they have given me total support, on and off the pitch, and I have a tremendous bond with them. We achieved so many great memories together and I couldn’t have succeeded without you.<br /><br />To me you are the best fans in the world. I hope I have done you all proud wearing the shirt and the armband. I want to thank my amazing teammates, coaches, managers and backroom staff, who I was honoured to work with and learn from. They all sided me on my way to playing 717 games for the club I love and it was a privilege to serve them as captain. They also helped me achieve my boyhood dream of playing for an captaining England, of which I am immensely proud. My club career and heart will always belong to Chelsea, but I am grateful for my loan spell at Nottingham Forest in 1999, which was invaluable for my development as a young player. And I want to say a thank you to Aston Villa for giving me the opportunity to play at such big club and captain it throughout the 2017/18 season. It was a privilege to represent such renowned football club with great fans. I look forward to the next chapter in my life and the challenges ahead</p>

I just knew and loved <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> from the moment I walked in and never looked back, I still love the club and look out for every result now.</p>
