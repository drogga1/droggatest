  <p><b>[Sporting boss Marcel Keizer wants Bruno Fernandes to remain at the Portuguese side amid ongoing links to Manchester United]</b> If it were up to me, the market would close, it’s good enough for me. But all the teams are waiting to see what happens with respect to new players and possible transfers. Sporting wants to keep the best but we are not in a position to keep all of our players and something will happen but I do hope they can stay<br /><br /><b>[When asked specifically how Sporting would cope if Bruno Fernandes leaves]</b> A player of his quality cannot be replaced</p>

  <p><b>[Marcel Keizer says Manchester United-linked Bruno Fernandes could leave Sporting CP during the current transfer window]</b> Bruno is a good player, an important player. Everyone would like that he stays but we do not know what the future will bring so we have to wait.<br /><br /><b>[When asked specifically about the links to Manchester United, Keizer said there was plenty of interest in the Portugal international]</b> I am just the coach. You ask the wrong guy. We know he plays very well and clubs like him and we have to see what happens. This is the job for the coach. You realise some players can go. Every player can go. Wait and see</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting head coach Marcel Keizer is not sure whether star midfielder Bruno Fernandes will remain at the club amid strong links to Manchester United]</b> We’ll see if we can keep our players and then we’ll see what we do. I hope he <b>[Fernandes]</b> stays, of course, like everyone else at Sporting, but we don’t know</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting CP head coach Marcel Keizer said the future of Bruno Fernandes is a question for the club’s board amid ongoing links to Manchester United]</b> Bruno Fernandes is an important player. Will he stay? It’s not a question for me, but for the management<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Sporting were humiliated by Primeira Liga champions Benfica on Sunday. Pizzi scored a brace, while Rafa Silva, Alex Grimaldo and Chiquinho were also on target against Sporting, who had Idrissa Doumbia sent off in the 89th minute]</b> It’s a night to forget. We had a good chance to score, but we couldn’t. We never gave up trying to score even after we were losing by two and three goals. Benfica also created a lot of chances and managed to score. It will be a very difficult week, but we have a match for the championship next week and we have to prepare it</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting CP coach Marcel Keizer is keen to keep hold of Dutch danger-man Bas Dost]</b> <b>[Dost]</b> trained all week, he’s here. We have to see what happens. We don’t want to lose our players, but the <b>[transfer]</b> window is still open and we have to wait. I would prefer if the transfer window was already closed. I need all the players we have, but sometimes that cannot happen. We have to wait and see</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting manager Marcel Keizer is hoping star captain <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> will remain with the club once the transfer window closes but concedes it could be outside of their control]</b> We have to wait until Monday. Hopefully he will stay. Many things can happen. We are not in a position to be able to decide<br /><br /><b>[Uruguay international and former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Sebastian Coates conceded three penalties and was sent off as Sporting crashed to their first league defeat of the campaign]</b> I have no opinion, the referee decided and I can do nothing. I only have an opinion about my team. We didn’t play enough. If we had had more ball after 2-1 it could have been different</p>
