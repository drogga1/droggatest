  <p><b>[Marcel Keizer has been named Ajax’s new coach, replacing Peter Bosz following his move to Borussia Dortmund]</b> The conversations we had were really positive and I also feel trust from the club. I was setting out to lead Jong Ajax to another good season in the Jupiler League, but in football things can suddenly change. This is obviously a very good opportunity that I will grab with both hands.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax coach Marcel Keizer says the club can only hope and pray that Abdelhak Nouri recovers as he is kept in intensive care after collapsing during a friendly against Werder Bremen]</b> It’s really too early. All we can do is hope and pray that he will recover. I’m not a doctor, so I can’t say anything about it. On Sunday the players are free, they will be kept informed of the situation. If they want, they can come to the club to talk about it.<br /><br />It’s impossible to describe what’s going on. Appie is part of Ajax. He is real Ajax: he comes from the youth system, everyone knows him. I saw immediately that this was severe. Everybody thought he had swallowed his tongue or something<br /><br />It could have been worse. At a certain point it took so long, you’re thinking of something really worse since his legs weren’t moving at all. His family and friends will come over <b>[on Sunday]</b>. We will support them in every way possible</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax coach Marcel Keizer says Abdelhak Nouri appeared completely fit after a medical just a week before he suffered a cardiac arrhythmia during a friendly on Saturday]</b> He was 100 percent fit. We are waiting on the results of the neurological tests. The results could come on Tuesday. He is in good hands and is being well cared for.<br /><br />Now we hope, it’s an important result for us. Everyone is feeling tense. Our doctor stayed there to keep in contact with the hospital. His family is there, they get all the updates first and then we hear it. I tried to distract myself on Sunday but just got on my bike. I tried to occupy my mind, but it didn’t work<br /><br /><b>[Nouri, affectionately known as Appie, has been with Ajax since he was seven years old]</b> It did not matter if the players came to training or not, everyone loves Appie. We encourage everyone to talk about it, cry together. He has a very good relationship with his room-mate Hakim Ziyech. But there are guys who have played football with him for 12 years. It’s not easy. I just hope he gets better. He represents Ajax for me, dominant and attractive football. That’s Appie. We are not so concerned with the qualifying round of the Champions League, it’s all about Appie first</p>

You ask the wrong guy. We know he plays very well and clubs like him and we have to see what happens. This is the job for the coach. You realise some players can go. Every player can go.
