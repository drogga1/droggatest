  <p><b>[Le Roy says he want the team to make Congo DR proud]</b> So far, so good. We are having a training camp for local based players in South Africa. This will enable us to assess the conditions, see what the facilities and such things are like, and our final training camp will be in Oman<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy’s predecessors had huge problems in convincing the Leopards’ professional players based abroad to join the team, but the 64-year-old said that at the moment, it seems to be quite the opposite]</b> When I arrived, I found that many of the players had said they no longer wanted to play for the team. But that has changed now and players like Youssouf Mulumbu (West Bromwich Albion), Bedi Mbenza (Anderlecht), Cedric Makiadi (Freiburg) or Cedric Mongongu (Evian) have re-committed and now everybody wants to play. They are even encouraging each other to join the national team and as a result we have fantastic players. I have to keep a good balance between local and professionals. The local players are refreshing for the national team, they inspire the team and the whole country<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy, who was in charge of the Leopards between 2004 and 2006, believes that things have changed for the better since then]</b> The federation is a little bit stronger, and they are more organised. The government is also helping. In Africa you need the help of the government, as without them you can do little. You need their help for training camps, to buy plane tickets, to pay for the bonuses. It is not necessary to spend a lot, but you have to be organised. Especially if you come to a tournament like the Cup of Nations. There you play with all details and they all have to be ready<br /><br /><b>[The Leopards have been described as the dark horses for the tournament, but Le Roy wants to hear nothing of it]</b> Please, please, please. We were ranked 129 when I took over, now we have just broken into the top 100. We’re in a group with Ghana and Mali. If we qualify for the second round it will be the beginning of a beautiful dream. If you are looking for favourites and dark horses, you have to look elsewhere.<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy will hold the record of seven Nations Cup appearances as a coach after South Africa]</b> What we want is to be perfect in terms of behaviour and fair play and if we win the fair play trophy that will be great. I want us to play a good tactical game and create a good image for the country. But, of course, we will try to go to the second round.<br /><br /><b>[He says that he has lasting memories from all previous appearances]</b> I have been very fortunate. I won the Nations Cup with Cameroon and the Gulf Cup with Oman. Everywhere I worked with the national team, it was a great pleasure and that is why they always ask me to come back. I have been very lucky to win all these trophies and I have been lucky to have had a lot of good players. But at the end of the day, victories are for players and defeats are for coaches.<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy, who is considered very active in social matters, is hoping that football can bring some respite to the troubles in Congo DR, where fighting in the east of the country has cost many people their lives]</b> A lot of players are concerned, and there has been war for too long in the country. It has so much potential, both in terms of football and everything. It could be one of the best countries if it could be calm. It is important that we put on a good showing. The players are the soldiers of the country and they have to show that they can all be one</p>

  <p><b>[French manager Claude Le Roy about Bruno Metsu]</b> I’m in shock. He fought like a lion. We had a lot of things in common. It’s terrible for him, for Viviane, his wife, and the little ones</p>

  <p><b>[Congo coach Claude Le Roy reveals why he always wears black on the touchline]</b> I started putting weight on a few years ago and I wear black clothes to cover it up. It’s as simple as that. I think I wear them pretty well, don’t I?</p>

  <p><b>[Le Roy says Togo’s potential is still there]</b> When I signed my contract, I was not told that qualification for the finals in Gabon was a must, so our main objective is to qualify for the AFCON finals in Cameroon in 2019. However, we will, of course, do everything to go to Gabon next year. If we win in Monrovia and then in Lome against Djibouti in early September, qualifying is quite possible. The group is very tight, with three teams still in contention, but everything will depend on our result in Liberia. With 13 points, we could qualify either directly or take one of the two runners-up positions<br /><br /><b>[The veteran coach took over after previous boss Tom Saintfiet and the Togolese FA agreed to part ways]</b> I felt they wanted me. I accepted because Togo is not a small country in African football. The country has participated in several Africa Cup of Nations finals and the World Cup in 2006. And there are very good players like <b>[Alaixys]</b> Romao, <b>[Emmanuel]</b> <a href="emmanuel-adebayor.html">Adebayor</a>, <b>[Kossi]</b> Agassa, the Ayite brothers <b>[Jonathan and Floyd]</b>, <b>[Serge]</b> Gakpe and <b>[Serge]</b> Akakpo. So the potential is there<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy said that since his appointment, he had spent some time meeting the players, including <a href="emmanuel-adebayor.html">Adebayor</a>, who had been scrapped from the team by Sainfliet]</b> I went to see him in London. We had lunch together. At one time he was one of the best strikers in the world. We need him, and I know he is very committed to his country and to his selection. During our discussion, I told him that I was counting on him that he was very important for the team, but there would be no favoritism. I explained how I work. And he agreed to come back<br /><br /><b>[An ongoing African love affair]</b> I have a special relationship with Africa. I remember that in Cameroon, we went on tour across the country to play friendly matches against local teams. Wherever I worked, I kept very good memories and made enduring friendships. I have always lived in the countries that I have coached. I do not see my job otherwise. A coach must know the country and its culture. And they need to scout throughout the country, to find players that can be integrated into the national team<br /><br /><b>[Le Roy, who is known to place great importance on issues such as proper transportation and accommodation facilities for players, on the quality of equipment and to medical care, believes that there are things that Africa could and should improve]</b> If there was more professionalism, players would not feel the need to leave<br /><br /><b>[The Frenchman, who resigned as Congo coach in November, said that he took a short vacation before entering the job market again]</b> I had several proposals in Europe, Asia and Africa. I thought at one time of coaching a club, which is very different from coaching a national team. I studied all the proposals, but I wanted to start in mid-April. I was tempted by some, but they were slow to materialise. In the end I took the Togo offer. I believe that if things should be done, they will be done</p>
