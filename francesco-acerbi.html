  <p><b>[Lazio defender Francesco Acerbi says his fight against testicular cancer pulled him out of a spiralling alcoholism following the death of his father]</b> After Dad died I crashed and hit rock bottom. I was at Milan and nothing was stimulating me. I didn’t know how to play anymore. I started drinking, I drank everything. Cancer saved me. I had something to fight against again, a limit to overcome<br /><br /><b>[While the tumour found at Sassuolo was immediately removed, it initially returned, leading to Acerbi undergoing chemotherapy]</b> I stopped being afraid six years ago. I kept telling myself, what do you do if that stuff comes back? I’ll face it again, I replied. I see things clearly before me and I know that from one day to the next, everything could change. I even say the disease improved me, it took away remorse and regret. I stopped dreaming, I prefer now to set myself achievable goals. I wanted to play for the national team, for example, and I got there<br /><br /><b>[Turning 32 in February, Acerbi still has plenty of time left as a defender at the top level. But, looking beyond that, he is starting to think about a future coaching role]</b> I’ll play until I’m 38. I want some satisfaction to take away from Lazio, then to the bench. I’ll be a coach</p>

  <p><b>[Serie A eyes comeback as Italy sees the light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel]</b> I know that only too well. Trust me: the priority is to get out of this terrible period. We mustn’t hurry, we must respect the rules imposed by the government. It’s better to stay at home an extra week than hurry to start everything up again and then find ourselves in the tunnel for several more months</p>
