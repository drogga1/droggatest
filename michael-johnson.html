  <p><b>[Chelsea have been urged to show Derby County more respect amid the intense speculation suggesting that Frank Lampard will be charged with the task of succeeding Maurizio Sarri at Stamford Bridge]</b> There has been no direct contact made by Chelsea, but you can’t get away from the noises and it’s probably going to be more ‘when’ than ‘if’. From our side, from Derby’s side, we want that little bit of respect from Chelsea’s regard. If you’re going to make the approach, just make the approach; be open and transparent about it. If we’re going to move on, then allow us to make that process happen. If not, then let’s squash all the rumours, allow the fans to relax, enjoy the summer and focus on Frank being our manager next year. We want to keep him, we want him to be our manager and, if there is to be an approach from Chelsea, then let’s be open and honest. The longer it goes on, the more disconnected we are as fans and as staff and that’s not right.<br /><br />I understand, as a player, the pull. It’s your former club, you spent a lot of years there, and you’re a legend there. People will talk about lack of experience, but there’s no guarantee that experience will get you anywhere. I think it’s very hard to hide behind that he’s got a lack of experience. What I would say is that it was a great year to be involved with Derby County and, hopefully under his leadership, there’ll be many more!</p>

  <p><b>[England U21 coach Michael Johnson says there is a way to solve lack of BAME representation]</b> The football field reflects the diverse UK but we are lacking so much upstairs. The recruitment process in football needs looking at, so you get the correct candidates. The only way we are going to get more diversity in management and leadership positions is if we create some kind of target like Lord Davies did with the FTSE 100 companies, when he recommended all boards should have a certain percentage of women. That is drastic action and it was needed<br /><br />It’s the same thing for people of ethnicity now - we need dome drastic action, whether that is a code that says all clubs need to hit this target by this year. That would get people of a diverse background into your leadership teams. You need some form of legislation, because we have seen over the decades, it has not moved.<br /><br /><b>[Johnson has one Masters degree in sporting directorship and also a UEFA-accredited Masters for international players, meaning he is well-qualified for a potential job as a sporting director at a club]</b> I have to behave in a completely different way than someone who is white and trying to be a sporting director, because the opportunities are more open for them than possibly me. The game might be difficult for you to get to where you should get to, based on your qualifications. There is something else that is blocking it - and we all know</p>
