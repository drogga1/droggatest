  <p><b>[Milos Veljkovic explains how Harry Kane changed his life to realise his professional dream]</b> I had a lot to do with him. I played a lot of games with him in the second team. He was already a great player with an excellent goal instinct and a strong technique. He was on loan a few times and did not succeed everywhere. But he has worked steadily on himself. I can remember a good conversation with him when he was on loan to Norwich. He had a broken foot and was out for a long time. Then he told me he would change his lifestyle in rehab. For his dream of professional football, he completely changed his diet and training. That paid off.<br /><br />His technical skills and his calm on the ball were incredible, I have not trained with a better player so far. Unfortunately, we never got to play a competitive match together<br /><br />We are the same year group, have played together for many years and won the U19 European Championship and U20 World Cup. I always knew he would go far. Today he is a world-class player who could play at any European top club</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why Madrid and Barcelona are ‘fighting over’ Frankfurt sensation Luka Jovic]</b> Luka has huge potential. I only know a few players who have such ability. He can do it with his right foot, his left and his head. The penalty area is his home, where he feels most comfortable. But I think he can improve even further. He is still very young. If he is willing to work on himself, he can do great things</p>
