  <p><b>[Benjamin Mendy was in typically humorous form after making his amazing Manchester City comeback]</b> All the time I am laughing with the fans on social media. I am the same as the fans - I go to the toilet and everything, so I am the same! I have never had a welcome like that, it was the best in the world. It was amazing after this long time. When I went on the pitch, the atmosphere was amazing. It has been a very long time, but every day I worked hard with the physio, the doctors and the players. I knew with this injury we had to wait and work, but nine months on I am strong. I stayed with my family and friends, who helped me through this moment.<br /><br /><b>[On Fabian Delph]</b> Maybe he will take my place. I need to work hard for my comeback but he has done great for the team this year, and Oleks Zinchenko the same. We are very good team-mates. But Fabian has been amazing - it is not his position but he has had a lot of assists, has been strong in defence. Every day I tell him he is superb<br /><br />I have never been sad. Every day I have been with the team, and in Barcelona I was with other players. All the time I have been happy</p>

We found out two days later. He was dying. I told myself: ‘What’s up with my knee, it’s nothing’. I think that helped with my recovery. When you’ve hurt your knee or your ligaments, it’s nothing at all compared to folk who suffer things that are far more serious.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City left-back Benjamin Mendy says he no longer uses his phone at the club’s training ground]</b> I know the fans love it, but the manager is the chief of the team, so when he says something I have to listen to him. Every player understands this. So in the dressing room, everywhere, I don’t pick up my phone. Every time I am with my phone I am on Instagram or Twitter and just now I need to be careful. When I am at the training centre, the CFA, I don’t use my phone but instead I listen to the manager.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about Guardiola’s recent requests]</b> Maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. I trust him, he has more experience of the players. I go without my phone. I don’t change but in the dressing room I don’t use my phone at all. It’s better. So I keep low, and on the pitch I give everything for the team and the fans<br /><br />I prefer an assist to scoring a goal - for me it’s more beautiful. It is my vision. If I can score but there is a player to pass to, I give them the ball. I have worked a lot for this but the first thing is that the team played very well. We focussed on the objective - the first home game is very important for the fans and my team-mates. And we did a lot for this honour for David Silva<br /><br /><b>[On David Silva]</b> It’s been the best day for him. He has worked so hard for this - it’s not easy to train and look after your son. He had a very difficult moment but now he is very happy, his son is fine and so are the family. And he gave them a very good gift with his free-kick</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mendy has hailed the influence that manager Pep Guardiola]</b> The manager has made football feel so, so good. But he works every time, every day. I don’t think he sleeps. Every time you see him, it’s football, football, football. When he speaks you feel he loves his job, he loves to work to find the solution and when you see this and hear him speak, you look at him and you want to give everything on the pitch for him.<br /><br />It’s not easy to be on the sidelines to wait to see every game, and when you see the team play very, very well, you want to jump on the pitch, but you can’t. Every game I waited and stayed with the team all the time as I didn’t want to be back home. When you see the game from the side of the pitch you learn a lot, so I watched every game, and sometimes after the game I ask questions to Pep and Mikel Arteta and they explain to me some of the good work</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mendy reveals Man City half-time team talk]</b> In the dressing room at half time we had spoken about what happened in the derby last year, and we were telling each other not to let that happen again. We remember it went 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, so we said we had to stay focused, keep trying to play and make chances. Every player was saying the same thing; ‘OK, guys, don’t do the same as last year, be careful, pay attention’. So when we came back on the pitch, we played better than the first half, so won the derby.</p>

  <p><b>[Mendy happy to know he is missed by <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> boss <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> When he <b>[Pep]</b> said he missed me I am always happy. It is something very good and it touched me. I want to show him, I think he knows, but I want to show <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and the world. First <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, because it is my team and I love this team and give everything for them because they deserve that for what they did for me for two years, while winning the cups and titles. I played a few games, but honestly, you win and I don’t feel the same. I am happy, but I don’t feel the same. I want to fight and say I helped my team win this trophy<br /><br /><b>[Mendy insists <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> will be motivated to get one over on the runaway leaders after a disappointing title defence]</b> What they are doing is incredible. In the game against them we need to show them that we won the title two times and we want to beat them. It will be a good game for us and them too</p>
