I got a call to go and do an assistant <b>[coaching]</b> job at a university. I took a jump and a leap of faith. It spiralled since then and I have been able to make a career out of it</p>

I’ve said this many, many times but right now it’s group stage for us, it’s one game, it’s Thailand and everything is singularly the focus.<br /><br /><b>[In the 2018 AFC Women’s Cup, Thailand drew with heavily favored Australia 2-2 over 120 minutes before falling to the Matildas in a penalty shootout]</b> That’s impressive in and of itself that now a team has been to back-to-back World Cups and with that comes the experience that you get from that. <b>[They have]</b> some talented players, some technical players.

And at this point everything that we focus on is about this group of players that are here now.

The American fans have traveled well from what I understand. I think it’s massive. The players want to play in front of their parents, their family and friends but to play in front of a crowd that can get behind you is a part of the game and it’s really important so I’m excited to see the U.S. fans turn out.</p>

There’s always things you can refine and polish. I’m not sure exactly what our next opponent <b>[Chile]</b> will do but teams sit low and it invites us on top of them a lot. It <b>[this win]</b> is how you want to start a tournament. You want to have that <b>[winning]</b> feeling. It’s having players feeling good about the game. It is about building momentum, getting that first game under your belt - that feeling - that’s going to be the biggest takeaway for us.<br /><br /><b>[Ellis said she would have no problems keeping her players grounded]</b> This is one step in that. They understand that the mission matters most.<br /><br />Alex Morgan tonight - I thought she was tight and tidy in the box.

  <p><b>[USWNT must forget Thailand demolition as Chile test awaits]</b> The beauty of this tournament is, the game that you just played is irrelevant. You can do a lot of breakdown on games you played, but the takeaways from games you’ve played has to be on what’s in front of you. I think that’s how it has to be in a tournament format. You can’t dwell on games.<br /><br />We want to move through the group stage and play good soccer and that’s really the focus. The trappings of everything else is probably more for everybody externally to deal with but right now the focus has to be what we’re doing inside our bubble<br /><br /><b>[Ellis was coy on her plans to introduce new players into her lineup]</b> In terms of playing time I think most of the players who are on this roster, maybe bar a couple, have had a lot of significant minutes, so having that trust and having that faith in those players, for a coach it certainly strengthens you</p>

A lot of this is about building momentum and so as a coach I don’t find it my job to rein my players in<br /><br />We’re going to sit and look at some film. There’s always things you can refine and polish. I’m not sure exactly what Chile will do but teams sit low and it invites us on top of them a lot.

I don’t think there’s plotting out a dream path or something like that. The draw is what it is and we navigate whoever is in front of us.<br /><br /><b>[The high-profile showdown between the U.S. and France has been anticipated since long before the tournament kicked off]</b> There’s actually another game in between the quarters and this game so there’s a lot of things that can play out<br /><br />If our team can focus on our performance and play to the level that we can, then I think we are a challenge and a handful for any team we play</p>

Sweden is a fantastic team, good transition team, strong, pacy team, good on set-pieces. Different demands than what we’ve just experienced.<br /><br />I think if you get too much into manipulating or planning or overthinking something, I just don’t think that that’s a good message. Deciding to come second - I think that can be dangerous. You have got to be prepared to play everybody to win this thing. The draw is what it is, and we navigate whoever’s in front of us</p>

In that regard, having probably been around Sir Alex at an internal level … everybody affects us, everybody influences us, you take a little bit of that away. Some things you like, some things you don’t. In our lives we’re all affected by people we come in contact with so I’m sure that’s had the same effect.<br /><br /><b>[Born in England, Ellis grew up a fan of Premier League giants United and said it was natural a great like Ferguson would also influence her]</b> <b>[He was]</b> super gracious, charming, nice.
