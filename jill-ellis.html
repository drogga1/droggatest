  <p><b>[Jill Ellis speaks about her entry into coaching]</b> I never actually wanted to be a coach. I went to college to play some football and get an education. I then went off on a different tangent and worked in the business world for a couple of years as a technical writer <b>[for a telecoms company]</b>. I got a call to go and do an assistant <b>[coaching]</b> job at a university. I took a jump and a leap of faith. It spiralled since then and I have been able to make a career out of it</p>

  <p><b>[Three observations from the USWNT’s blowout win over Panama]</b> The sole reason was to manage this tournament. It was really about making sure it’s a 13-day type deal with five games - it’s a lot. We have the ability to do that and I think with the talent we have on this team it makes sense.<br /><br /><b>[On Hailie Mace]</b> A lot of what we’re trying to do is train for situations. It’s not just about today’s game, it’s about adding more to our game. In situations where perhaps there are five minutes left and you need to force a goal, what does that look like? As a coach I think there’s different situations that I’d rather manage now and see them and learn from them now then wait until next summer<br /><br /><b>[On Carli Lloyd]</b> I can’t say you expect anything less. Ultimately what she gives us is the ability to score goals and to see her get a hat trick tonight was great</p>

Tonight, playing against such a low low block was really good for us to try and sharpen our skills.<br /><br />I’ve said so many times, steel sharpens steel and we’ve got to make sure our opponents within our region are strong so that we’re challenged out on the pitch</p>

All these things are excellent for our game in terms of willingness to grow our sport, grow our brand, make it more available and supportive. I think it’s great and we need to make sure that’s supported.<br /><br />My own personal opinion is putting three finals in one day isn’t supporting the women’s game</p>

  <p><b>[Jill Ellis repeats a lineup during the group stage of the Concacaf Women’s Championship]</b> What I’m looking for is are the the things that we’re trying to execute, are those getting better in terms of attacking defending. So, I think we’re looking at the components within the game first and foremost. I think we’ve got a very deep squad and I think we’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of choices, but I think what’s been consistent over the past six months is that the players that we’ve utilized understanding the roles, responsibilities in the game. That’s maybe what I’m kind of implying in terms of being the best version of ourselves.<br /><br />There is no other goal right now. That’s simple enough. This is the game. I would honestly say, I know certainly within our staff that no one has looked beyond this game. That’s just how it has to be. You have to pay the same amount of detail regardless of opponent when so much is on the line. That’s a bridge you cross hopefully when you come to it, but right now it’s about Jamaica</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT’s Concacaf final win represents first step toward World Cup victory in France]</b> I think it’s getting better at what we do. The Tournament of Nations was a really good test for us in how we want to play and against very diverse teams and how they play. I like the things we’re doing, we just need to get better at it. I think the depth is there. It’s continuing to evolve our game.<br /><br />I think we got a little conservative in how we wanted to play, and I think that’s part of our development and part of our evolution is, if you’re up a goal, it’s keep the pedal down, it’s continue to push to the next one. It’s continued growth of the team. Sometimes an early goal can actually be to your detriment<br /><br />It feels like a starting point in terms of where we want to be. I think this was a good base, a good start to not concede a goal in the tournament. Canada made it hard at times for us tonight</p>

Playing a World Cup-qualified team and a country that is on the rise will be two good matches to end our 2018 schedule.</p>

We’ll get to experience a variety of teams in regard to their strengths and styles of play and almost all of the countries will be in their World Cup preparation as well. We are playing tough games in Europe, which is vitally important, and also get to play quality opponents in front of our home fans at venues all across the USA. It will go fast, but these games will be a major factor in pushing us to be at our peak once we arrive in France next summer.</p>

  <p><b>[Lindsey Horan has missed out on the U.S. women’s national team roster]</b> The SheBelieves Cup is a positive event in many ways, but it’s extremely valuable to get three challenging games against World Cup-bound teams in a short time span that can simulate navigating through group play. These are all teams that can go deep in the tournament this summer and provide the kind of tests we need as we continue to work to crystalize our lineup and our final roster for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT looks to work on nervous system in SheBelieves Cup]</b> I feel really good about where we are. In terms of personnel, yes I think this is a consistent group we’ve had in. I think they are building good units within the group<br /><br />We’re at a point now where I hope we’re seeing the same things, understanding the same processes and what we want to have happened … speaking the same language. You’ve kind of built the skeleton and now you’re working on the nervous system<br /><br />Right now it’s critical that our back line and our goalkeeper start to really to build cohesion, so it’s not just giving players time to give them time. We want to make sure we’re accomplishing something<br /><br />The door is not closed for anybody. I had a meeting with Dani and I said basically that. She’ll have preseason training with her club team, she’ll have preseason matches, she’ll have regular season matches so she’ll have an opportunity to get herself back in<br /><br />In terms of Jessica McDonald, I thought she did very well in our January camp, it’s now the third <b>[camp]</b> straight she’s been with us<br /><br />It’s part of the beauty of the job in dealing with this is you have to have a plan and that’s why you can’t only train 11 players, you train your whole team</p>

  <p><b>[With World Cup closing in, SheBelieves Cup takes on added importance for USWNT]</b> It’s exactly how we want these teams in here because they’re so unique. Each team has a unique skill set and obviously I think for us we’re going to take it one game at a time but I think what we also look at is what common things do these three teams have and what things do we need to sharpen.<br /><br />I think we take this tournament seriously every year in terms of good teams and wanting to win it, but I think every coach in here recognizes the opportunity here to probably not show their full hand</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT experiments falling flat in disappointing SheBelieves Cup]</b> We recognize right now we’ve got to shore things up. Ultimately, we’ve got to make sure our players understand that the margin for error is very small against these top teams in the world, and we’ve been punished several times for that.<br /><br />The players understand, this is the last five percent we need to do to get things completely right. We’ve got to be 100 percent for 90-plus minutes in games and I think this is another opportunity to test ourselves to be ready for the summer<br /><br />Sam came in and was an impact player for us for sure. So it’s looking at different pieces in terms of what’s a good blend in that midfield<br /><br />There are definite areas where we’ve got to improve in terms of just the details of a back line. You can’t be off a yard against these teams</p>

I would say that players who have played at that level are never off the radar. When you get close to a World Cup and seeing Ali training at outside back, I know she’s fit. With Kelley not being here, sometimes the experience piece is something you have to take into consideration going into a massive event like this.<br /><br />I haven’t blinked in terms of Kelley O’Hara not being an option to take to the World Cup. The surgery she had was pretty significant in terms of cleaning up an ankle, so I think what we’re seeing right now is just a continued recovery from that, but I saw her flying around the field in terms of running. I think she’s on the mend and we’re optimistic, our medical team is very optimistic - knock on wood</p>

They all pushed each other in every training session and every game and challenged the coaches to make some tough decisions.

  <p><b>[Ali Krieger headlines surprise names on USWNT World Cup squad]</b> What I know about Ali Krieger is that no moment is ever going to be too big for her. As a coach when you get down to this point, the psychological piece is also a part of your consideration when you look at your players.<br /><br />I’ve spent a lot of time looking at depth in the back and with Kelley O’Hara in return-to-play mode, the importance of experience in that back line certainly in an event this big comes into play<br /><br />When you pick a roster, you obviously have a starting 11, you have your core 13 or 14 but then beyond that you’re looking for players who can come in and change a game. I think Jessica McDonald is someone who can embody and embrace that role. She’s obviously got physical qualities, she’s got a nose for goal, she’s fantastic in the air, she has a long throw-in, so there’s a lot of good things there in terms of what she brings to this roster<br /><br /><b>[Ellis addressed her team’s fullback depth issues]</b> We can play Tierna Davidson as a left back, I think Kelley has played left back probably more than Crystal in terms of the program and with her club team as well, so I think we have depth there</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Dunn had been a lock to make the 2019 World Cup roster for some time]</b> I think Crystal is probably the most versatile player that I’ve had to date with this group of players. She can play any line, usually a player moves across lines or maybe two lines but Crystal has proven to me that she’s adept at playing any line and that’s what makes her so special<br /><br />Now the positions are so fluid and interchangeable that players aren’t locked or rigid. Suddenly you see Man City, you see the outside backs playing in the midfield so it’s more about the understanding of players knowing when they’re in that position, what’s the role of that position, and we’ve had a lot of time to work on that</p>

  <p>I think it is one of the most challenging jobs. You’ve got to make sure you’re listening to the people that are important to listen to.

Make sure you do it in the way you want to do it. Because that’s very much how I felt</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT vs Portugal women. Ellis, who announced her decision to step down as USWNT coach shortly after the World Cup-winning victory, explained her decision to call up Hamilton and Short]</b> With the injuries we currently have to several World Cup players, and with two of our main priorities on the Victory Tour being spreading around the minutes and keeping players healthy for their clubs during this critical playoff push, it made sense to call in Casey and Kristen to give us options and depth for these games against what will be a tough Portugal team<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on her next career steps, Ellis spoke about the possibility of coaching a men’s side]</b> People naturally see that as a step up and I don’t necessarily see it that way. I coach the best team in the world. I see it as not a ‘this’ move. It would be a ‘this’ move <b>[she said, pointing her fingers at each other to signify a lateral move]</b>. I’ve never coached men.

The World Cup was such a world showcase event that people get on board, and this is an exciting team with great personalities. Ultimately what does a fan want?

  <p><b>[When Jill Ellis announced she was stepping down as U.S. women’s national team manager in July, she was asked if she would like to see a woman replace her]</b> Of course. I think there are a lot of qualified females<br /><br /><b>[Ellis says that a lack of female head coaches is an issue that begins at the grassroots level]</b> I definitely think we need more candidates to even pull from. That should be not just our federation’s initiative on that part, which I know they’re working on, but it should be at every level, whether it’s high school, whether it’s club soccer. I think there needs to be more of a push<br /><br /><b>[Ellis, herself a former UCLA coach, knows that the current women’s soccer infrastructure in the U.S. doesn’t sufficiently incentivize coaches who want to jump from the college game to the pros]</b> I was a college coach and so there is a comfort level there in terms of security. It’s a shortened season and typically it’s a better-paying job potentially than where we are yet with our pro league - you hope that changes. Why would a female college coach leave to go into a position that’s maybe less stable, maybe less paying? It’s sometimes a big leap</p>
