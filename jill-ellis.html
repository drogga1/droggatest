  <p><b>[Ellis is not surprised by the success Phil Neville has enjoyed in the past, pointing to a decorated playing career where he won 10 major trophies at Manchester United with Ferguson in charge]</b> A lot of us are products of our environments and obviously he had a pretty good mentor there for a while. I’m not surprised <b>[by Neville’s success]</b>. In terms of managing a team, I think the team has made strides, you can see they’re playing hard, bought into what he wants them to do, I think he’s done a really good job. I haven’t seen Phil on the inside so I can’t speak to what he’s like in front of his team. My interactions have been purely professional, he conducts himself in a great way. I enjoyed our sideline conversations - he seems like a really genuine person.<br /><br />As it relates to Sir Alex, I grew up a Man United fan so I can’t speak enough about him as a manager, <b>[he]</b> brought the best out of his players, was ruthless at times. In that regard, having probably been around Sir Alex at an internal level … everybody affects us, everybody influences us, you take a little bit of that away. Some things you like, some things you don’t. In our lives we’re all affected by people we come in contact with so I’m sure that’s had the same effect.<br /><br /><b>[Born in England, Ellis grew up a fan of Premier League giants United and said it was natural a great like Ferguson would also influence her]</b> <b>[He was]</b> super gracious, charming, nice. It was a brief interaction but I’ve read his books and being a young Man United fan back in the day, I was all in! I think for me I’ve had a lot of different influences in my life.

Obviously I feel we have a really good, deep bench and called upon other players and I think they did a fantastic job. Yeah, <b>[it’s]</b> a hamstring strain. I thought Pressy <b>[Christen Press]</b> did fantastic. There was an outside chance Rapinoe could take a penalty, so thereby we didn’t want to extend ourselves more than we had to in terms of giving our starting XI when we needed to. Every coach wants to keep their cards as close to their chest as possible, fortunately we didn’t have to go to penalty kicks but that was an option, potentially<br /><br /><b>[The USWNT boss also played down any talk of secrecy surrounding the decision to sit the winger]</b> I don’t know about secrecy.
