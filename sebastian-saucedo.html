<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sebastian Saucedo is hoping to represent the United States in Olympic qualification next month]</b> The senior team called me in to play Costa Rica, but because of a game here - we traveled to Torreon and the U.S. game against Costa Rica was Saturday, so they didn’t let me go<br /><br />For Olympic qualification, there’s the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> date. I imagine the club will deal with that when it comes to letting us go or not. I’d like to go. It would be a dream to qualify for the Olympics<br /><br />When I was in Salt Lake, I may not have had as much opportunity to get into the national team and everything but after coming to Pumas, the first games have gone really well for me. The manager of the senior team called me, the (U-23 manager) is always talking to me to see how I am, so it’s something different and something important to be here<br /><br /><b>[Saucedo has started each match]</b> I feel a lot better here. Not only being with better players in the squad than where I was, but also because I’ve been able to fight for my spot here. I think there it was sort of a situation where the older player or more experienced player plays, whereas here if you’re doing well in trainings and in games, you’re going to keep being a starter</p>
