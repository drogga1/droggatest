  <p><b>[Mikel Merino has officially joined Newcastle United on loan for the 2017-18 season]</b> It feels good and I’m very happy to be here, to be part of this club. I’m looking forward to touching the ball, meeting my new team-mates and starting to play football. I know it’s a great club and a really nice city. I had different options but I think this is the right place for me to play.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Merino was delighted to hear Newcastle United fans label him better than Cesc Fabregas after his bright start at the club]</b> I was very amused. He comes from Spain, he has a lot of class and he’s better than Fabregas’, they more or less sing. I saw it on Twitter, it was very funny.<br /><br />It was a busy summer. I think <b>[Newcastle]</b> was the right decision. Newcastle pushed for me, and what a player wants is to feel loved and valued to prove what he is capable of doing. Newcastle gave me that. The city is very nice, the team is great, the coach is one of the best there is and I can learn a lot from him, so in the end it’s a place where I can learn a lot.<br /><br />I wanted Benitez to be at Newcastle, and it struck me that he trusted me. He is one of the best and I can learn a lot from him. He is very meticulous, takes all of his options into account and knows a lot about football. That comes in handy when you’re young. I’m not 100% yet. But eventually I’ll get to that level. For now I am adapting to the speed and pace of the Premier League. But I’m becoming a footballer again. I have been able to play at the start of the season start and that is very important.<br /><br />Last season helped me to see professional football differently. To see that not everything is as beautiful as before. To learn from it, to know that we must continue fighting even if things go wrong. I matured a lot as a footballer and as a person<br /><br />Normally I would be at the back with Marc Bartra, but that day I sat in the front, because there was a free space. I put my headphones at full blast, and as we went 10 metres, I heard a super loud, deafening sound. We did not know where it came from.<br /><br />The bus ended up on two wheels because of the blast. When we looked, we could not see anything. Only smoke. The windows were broken. The people on the floor, no one knew what was going on, some screaming, there was blood. It was a shock.<br /><br />We didn’t know whether to move forward or to remain still. We thought that if they had put a bomb and we were not dead, they could arrive with guns to finish the job.<br /><br />If we went ahead, they could have had more bombs as well. At the end, we moved forward and moved away from the area of ​​the explosion. There were people who got off the bus, but I did not dare. We were terrified. It was pretty hard. But in the end what you have is the memory to value what we have more<br /><br /><b>[On Ousmane Dembele who leave for Barcelona this summer in a deal which could reach €147 million]</b> I do not know if I expected him to reach that fee. But I expected that he was of the level to sign for Barcelona. He is a great player with a bright future. The market is as it is and these figures are paid. Beyond the money that has been spent, the signing is very good for the future that awaits Dembele. He is a great player: plays with both feet, very, very fast, able to change any game at any time. For players like that you pay a lot of money. I suppose it will take some time, but he will do very well in La Liga</p>

  <p><b>[VAR rules to swing <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> title race in Madrid’s favour]</b> We’re angry rather than sad. I think I was at least five metres from the goalkeeper when I was flagged offside. We have to accept what happened.</p>
