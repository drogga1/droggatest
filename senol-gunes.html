  <p><b>[Turkey players celebrate France draw with controversial salute gesture]</b> Like all countries, we don’t want our soldiers to be deployed. It’s just a mark of support to our soldiers.

  <p><b>[Turkey head coach Senol Gunes compare <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> with City boss Pep Guardiola]</b> They are both technically and tactically on a high level. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> finished with 98 points last season. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> added two players to the squad and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> used them. When manager, management and squad superiority match up, good things happen. If a team loses the championship race at the earliest point <b>[in history]</b>, a year after they became champions, there may be problems.<br /><br />Football is not like 2+2=4. One team lost but didn’t quit and kept moving. If that team stopped going when they lost, today they wouldn’t get the chance of becoming champions. It’s a good and beautiful lesson. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> already comes from the German school of ethics. His work and discipline is very clear. He knows his limits and strength. He doesn’t use it in a megalomaniac way. There’s no surrender in his mindset, he’s got the warrior spirit. I think the management, coach and players work in a very harmonious way<br /><br /><b>[Gunes went on to express his frustration over the format for this summer’s European Championship, which is being held in 12 cities across 12 <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> countries]</b> Unfortunately, it seems to me that Turkey couldn’t be the sole hosts of this tournament because we had demands in the time of <b>[Michel]</b> <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>. They have spread the games between 12 cities so they could avoid giving the tournament to Turkey. I don’t find it very healthy, but I have to see it. Because the league will be over, the players will have physical and mental fatigue. They will compete in the national team and also will travel. For example, we will go long distance, but Switzerland’s situation is worse than us<br /><br />We will go from Baku to Rome and play two matches. Switzerland will play against Wales in Baku and go to Rome, then return to Baku. This is the situation, we’ll see the pros and cons. Instead of complaining, we will accept it. Our group includes Italy, Wales, Switzerland. Our first match is the opening match of the tournament. This is also a chance for us. The fact that our opponent will play in their home is an advantage for them, but the opening game will be in a very nice atmosphere where players can show themselves. The first game of the tournament is just one game. It’s a game everyone watches. No other motivation is needed for the players. Of course, we aim to be successful in this competition but, more importantly, besides the sporting achievements, we want to play our own football, with fair play and show it to others. We want everyone to see this</p>
