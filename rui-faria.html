  <p><b>[Rui Faria is confident their fortunes will change]</b> Again, you know, we did more than enough to win the game in a comfortable way. We didn’t and the reality is that we are playing well. The team is doing what we ask. We create the opportunities but we are not scoring the goals and we are suffering because we want to win the matches. The answers are on the pitch. We create good chances and as a team we played very well. What we didn’t get was the goals that should happen with the opportunities we create to win the match. We can say we are unlucky and in the last matches we should get different results. We all believe the results will appear.<br /><br /><b>[When asked to explain Mourinho’s dismissal]</b> The referee explained it to Jose and there is nothing more to say. I think <b>[it was]</b> frustration from Jose after the yellow card for Pogba. It should be a foul for us but the referee understood it in another way. I don’t take over. I follow the normal procedure. The boss is Jose all the time and he passes on what is the best for the team and we just try to make it happen without having him there.</p>

  <p><b>[Stuttering Manchester United are not worried about their faltering Premier League title hopes]</b> <b>[Title gone?]</b> In this moment we are more worried about looking to the team and getting the best results. We knew that the job was not an easy job, we fight to change things, and this is what we are going to keep doing because we believe in the players. We believe in the team and we believe that things will change and what we are chasing will arrive for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Long-time Jose Mourinho collaborator Rui Faria has taken his first head coaching job with Qatar’s Al Duhail]</b> Al Duhail club management has contracted Portuguese coach Rui Faria to be the coach of the team in the upcoming period after many negotiations and great efforts made by the club management to obtain the coach despite the great European offers he had in the last period from a number of clubs that wanted to work with him, and also the great coaches who wanted to add him to their coaching staff.<br /><br />The club will present its new coach to the media in a major press conference that will be announced in the upcoming two days</p>
