  <p><b>[Thailand league and national team may be included in Pro Evolution Soccer]</b> Both of us need this. Konami knows that the South East Asia market has been growing, only second to China, which is number one. So it’s obviously a rapidly growing market here. We know this too, and know that this will spread Thai football to gamers. Video games are also an excellent tool to introduce players, teams and the Thai League itself to the world.<br /><br />So we’re discussing the possibilities of working together, both on mobile and console platforms. We will help them be familiar with the Thailand market, and take note of their goals.<br /><br />After this we will move on to licensing. We believe our contents can support the game as well. They also have their terms and condition details about licensing. So it’s still in the discussion stage here.<br /><br />We are looking for the opportunity to integrate Thai clubs and competitions to the future PES, on both mobile and console platforms. We are aiming for the Pro Evolution Soccer edition that will come out in two years’ time, as the 2018 edition is already completed while the 2019 edition is nearing completion. The mobile edition can be developed faster due to its rapidly-updating nature, but for consoles it is likely to take more time. Another option that we have is for Konami to develop an entirely new game, specifically for the Thai League</p>
