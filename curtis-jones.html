  <p><b>[This season, Jones has moved from Under-18s football to Under-23s.

Even Jones has struggled at times]</b> Every young lad’s dream is to break into the first team. But saying that, if I want to catch the eye of the manager as an attacking player, I definitely think I’ll need a lot more goals and a lot more assists.<br /><br />You see with Mane, Salah, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, they’re causing teams a big problem and scoring a lot of goals. If I want to get the breakthrough and catch his eye, I need to be matching that</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool teenager Curtis Jones targets more playing time after <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut]</b> Growing up and being a local lad, I think it’s everyone’s dream to go and play for your boyhood club. And to do it at a young age is a massive honour and I’m grateful, and I just say a massive thank you to the gaffer and his staff for having the belief in me. As everyone could see the scoreline was perfect, so I could come on and be relaxed and play and show what I’m capable of doing. I spoke to the gaffer when I was getting warmed up and he was telling me to go on and be calm and go and play my game, which gave me all the confidence I needed. I went out there and I just tried to play my game. When you go into different kind of games and you play with a few of the youth lads, who don’t have that experience, it’s always that little bit harder. But today I think the rest of the boys around me made it that little bit easier and I’m looking forward to a few more of them games<br /><br /><b>[The youngster tweeted after the game that he had been dreaming of his first top-flight appearance for the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> outfit for a long time]</b> I grew up dreaming of this day. Unbelievable feeling making my <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut for <b>[Liverpool]</b> today. Another great win and another 3pts for the team. Thanks for all the messages and support!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool teenager Curtis Jones admits he has been begging <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> to play in recent weeks]</b> I just go out there and try and play my game. It’s been frustrating at times being on the bench and then getting a taste on the pitch and then being back on the bench. I’ve been basically begging to come on but hopefully I’ve topped it off with a good goal. I can’t sum up my emotions. For me it’s huge just being around this team every day and learning from this group of players. There are world-class players all over this team but I think I went out and showed what I could do on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[The rise of Curtis Jones - <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s newest Merseyside derby hero]</b> I can’t sum up my emotions. I think for me, being a young lad, a local lad and playing for the team that I love and the fans that I love, it’s massive.<br /><br /><b>[Jones thrived under <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> when the Kop legend returned as an Academy coach in 2018]</b> He was the perfect person at the perfect time to help me<br /><br /><b>[Gerrard sought to iron out the imperfections, the tendency to hold onto the ball too long, to over-elaborate when the game became too easy for him.

  <p><b>[Curtis Jones was able to reflect on a dream come true after becoming the youngest player ever to captain Liverpool]</b> I never thought I’d get the opportunity so early to be the captain of the team. It’s a dream come true and it has always been a dream since I was a kid and I think that goes for any local lad at the academy now. Any player at the academy and even in the first team now <b>[wants]</b> to captain this great team in front of these unbelievable fans. To do it at such a young age is a huge honour and one which will stick with me the rest of my life regardless<br /><br /><b>[Jones would later reveal that club captain <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> had also been in touch to offer support]</b> Yeah of course. The players the whole week have been sending messages, wishing us luck and texting us individually to tell us what we need to do in our game and how to impress and help the team. The stuff they were saying will benefit individuals going forward in the future<br /><br /><b>[Of his own captain’s speech]</b> Regardless of whether I was captain or not I was always going to get around the lads because they look at me and see me with the seniors every day, so it’s only right I get around them. The rest of the staff were great in the build-up, Milner was in there giving a talk so the boys were confident and they went out there and did exactly what happens when young lads play. There are no words to explain how great the boys did<br /><br />I just enjoy every opportunity I get whether it is for the under-19s in the Champions League, or for Critch in the 23s or for Jurgen in the first team. I go out there and try to enjoy myself and show what I am capable of doing. I think for any young player that is coming into a team like this where there are players who are the best in the world - we have a whole team full of unbelievable characters and unbelievable footballers and they are all unbelievably talented - so you have to go out there confident and stand up and show what you are capable of doing and that’s what I try to do every game, like everyone says<br /><br />I think for any player on the outside looking in they might say <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a hard team to get into, in terms of the players they have in each position, they have a world-class starting XI. But everyone sees the gaffer is there for the youth and has belief in them and that is why he gives us this opportunity. He gave me other opportunities along the way and I am sure the rest of the boys will get theirs in time</p>

  <p><b>[Curtis Jones: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the perfect place for me &amp; no need to consider leaving Klopp	]</b> I think it’s perfect for me. I don’t think I’d be as successful under a different type of manager and a different team. With his staff, I think for me to be the player that I want to become and I see myself becoming, I think Jurgen, Pep, Pete and the rest of the staff are the perfect ones for me in terms of the belief they have in me, in terms of their philosophy, how they play and even their aims and their goals. They want to win so much to make the fans and the people of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so happy. For me it’s also the same because I come from that, so I understand, so for me it’s absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Being around the players every day, you pick up different habits, just what they are doing. I’ve always said that <b>[James]</b> Milner has been a massive one for me. I first went on the pre-season tour when I was 17 and he was always one that I guess he knew the ability that I had, but other things needed work in terms of the defensive part of my game, positioning and how to react when giving away the ball. He’s always guided me in the right path so I’m grateful for that. Another one that’s big for me is Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b>. He’s basically similar to me in he is a local lad, he comes from a normal background and he’s had to work hard to get into the position that he’s in now. We are from the same city and we have the same type of goal in terms of we want to play for this club and we want to achieve stuff to give back to the fans, so Trent is also a big one for me</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool youngster Curtis Jones agrees new long-term contract]</b> For me, as everyone knows, it’s massive. It’s my boyhood club and it’s the whole of my family’s club as well, so for me it’s huge. I think the environment and stuff is all positive and keeps me as positive as I can. Of course, we’re working with a great manager and around the best team in the world, so for me it was easy and <b>[I’m]</b> extremely proud. It’s a perfect environment. The whole of the team is perfect for me to watch every day in training. They do everything perfectly - their professionalism around the place, it’s perfect. So I’m picking up all that and taking it into my game and to me as a person. It’s paying off right</p>
