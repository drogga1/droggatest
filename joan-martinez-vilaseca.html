  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta - The story of how Barcelona signed one of the greats]</b> We discovered him during the Brunete tournament, Albert Benaiges was our youth team coach and he alerted us about Iniesta, we began to work and we came to see him. He had amazing technical skills, he was very fast making decisions and had incredible vision; he had everything we look for in young midfielders. It wasn’t easy to bring him to Barcelona but as fate would have it, Barca met Albacete in the youth Copa del Rey and we went to meet his family again. His father told us he was still very young and I understood, but I told him that being such a good player soon or later new offers would arrive and I told him to remember that we would always be interested in him.<br /><br />We were the first club to show interest in him and we invited Andres and his family to see La Masia if they ever came to Barcelona. After a few weeks his father called me and told us they were on a trip to Port Aventura theme park so we invited them to see La Masia. At that time, young Real Madrid starlets were living in rented flats, not in a residence; in the past, we were able to beat Real Madrid to young <b>[Ivan]</b> de la Pena for the same reason. We had lunch at La Masia and they loved it, we were the only Academy with a residence; Iniesta’s father called us again a few days after that meeting and they told us they had accepted our offer<br /><br />Iniesta is a very complete player, he can be fantastic in the middle or as a winger, a very complex role today, and that is something that only a few players in the world can do at this level. He hasn’t said his last words in Spain yet. It is going to be sad, but he will leave at his very best</p>
