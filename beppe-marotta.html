  <p><b>[When Beppe Marotta arrived in Turin four years on from the club’s relegation to Serie B, the Old Lady was back in the top flight but still struggling with a sense of loss]</b> We found a disheartened atmosphere but, above all else, there was no football culture. That’s what the president and we directors tried to bring to the club.<br /><br /><b>[Even today, he claims that in Italy there is]</b> a total absence of medium-to-long term vision. The Italian system thinks about earning one or two million today, rather than 10 million tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[asked how he selects his signings?]</b> In two ways: We either take someone who is already an established champion: look at Dani Alves, <b>[Mario]</b> Mandzukic, Khedira, <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain and so on. Or, we look for talent. But only a talent who can become a champion. That means someone who has not only the technical qualities but also the human values to turn into a champion, as happened with <b>[Paulo]</b> Dybala, for example<br /><br />The Cardiff final was born last summer. It was a transfer market campaign designed specifically for this objective. Andrea, Pavel, Fabio and myself, together with the coach, we had decided to raise the bar. We said to ourselves, ‘In Italy, we understood the right recipe for success; now let’s see if we can now also go all the way in Europe’.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed Juventus are interested in signing Gianluigi Donnarumma from AC Milan]</b> It’s clear Juve have the right to study all opportunities. When a player is on the market we have a duty to try to sign him, but not right now. He is a talent. Then we have to differentiate between a talent and a champion.<br /><br />It’s increasingly difficult to manage these situations. We are facing a radical change in the figure of the young footballer. These days, professionals close to them plan out their career, even in opposition to the clubs which raised them. That’s a fact. The rules need to be changed, and the efforts clubs make in the youth sector must be protected with some kind of compulsory apprenticeship<br /><br /><b>[On Marco Verratti and Douglas Costa]</b> Thanks to Bayern, we are in contact for Douglas Costa’s availability. But the Germans must be willing to sell him and the price must be right. Based on tactics and the investment needed, Verratti doesn’t interest us</p>

I take nothing away from the decision of journalists and coaches, but I would have voted for Cristiano Ronaldo and I say that as a football fan. His absence is a personal and private choice that has nothing to do with Juventus and must be respected.

Last season we also had <a href="keita-balde.html">Keita <a href="keita-balde.html">Balde</a> Diao</a> and <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>, now we have only one forward. We’re trying to ponder and evaluate the various profiles, but it’s a year of change, <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and his new ideas have arrived, whereas next year we’ll certainly be more prepared and streamlined<br /><br />I know <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> very well, I know his language and how to interpret him in the best way. The whole club is in sync, even in symbiosis, with the coach, with his focus on details, the fact he is very demanding and has a strong working culture at the base of everything. This is why he feels the need to have a team at his disposal as soon as possible. However, the long transfer window means clubs expand their timing a little and it hasn’t really gone into the next phase yet. It’s obvious that we are struggling above all in attack, but we want to do things calmly so that we don’t make any hasty choices. Every decision will be made and shared with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, without doubt, but we must also recognise that there are economic balances to be respected and so we are keeping a close eye on the Financial Fair Play situation. We cannot make too heavy an investment, as we risk falling back into the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> bad books.<br /><br /><b>[Marotta talked further about the balance required for <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> in dealing with his current squad]</b> We are with the coach in wanting to build a competitive squad and we know the great difficulties he is having for his working methods. When I talk about focus on details, it also means being rigid in his squad structure. On the one hand, there is the need to create a team and bring in new faces, on the other the requirement to sell those who are surplus to requirements and no longer part of the project, taking nothing away from their professionalism. It’s natural that a player who is ready to leave won’t participate with too much intensity in pre-season training. It’s difficult to create a definitive team structure in such a long transfer window. I want to reiterate that <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s needs are our needs, to improve and reinforce the team</p>

  <p><b>[Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta says the club is in ‘advanced negotiations’ for <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Achraf Hakimi</a> as the fullback nears a potential move to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>]</b> The will of <b>[owners]</b> the Zhang family is to continue buying important players. I confirm that we are in an advanced negotiation for <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a>. <b>[Inter sporting director Piero]</b> <a href="piero-ausilio.html">Ausilio</a> has been very good, but we must now conclude the negotiation. Tomorrow will be an important day, I am optimistic. It is a job done from <a href="piero-ausilio.html">Ausilio</a> in these two months. This is an operation that, with the times that are going, is really very, very important.<br /><br />To make a player like <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a> on the left too? We want to raise the bar, it’s the will of the owner. But we also have to mix in the economic needs, especially at this stage. We will see the opportunities</p>
