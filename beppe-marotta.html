We cannot rush things because that can lead to mistakes. We have clear ideas but we need to be patient.

  <p><b>[Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has confirmed the club are in the hunt for two strikers]</b> We are seeking two strikers, one more experienced and another younger, because as of today we only have <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>. Last season we also had <a href="keita-balde.html">Keita Balde Diao</a> and <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>, now we have only one forward. We’re trying to ponder and evaluate the various profiles, but it’s a year of change, <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and his new ideas have arrived, whereas next year we’ll certainly be more prepared and streamlined<br /><br />I know <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> very well, I know his language and how to interpret him in the best way. The whole club is in sync, even in symbiosis, with the coach, with his focus on details, the fact he is very demanding and has a strong working culture at the base of everything. This is why he feels the need to have a team at his disposal as soon as possible. However, the long transfer window means clubs expand their timing a little and it hasn’t really gone into the next phase yet. It’s obvious that we are struggling above all in attack, but we want to do things calmly so that we don’t make any hasty choices. Every decision will be made and shared with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, without doubt, but we must also recognise that there are economic balances to be respected and so we are keeping a close eye on the Financial Fair Play situation. We cannot make too heavy an investment, as we risk falling back into the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> bad books.<br /><br /><b>[Marotta talked further about the balance required for <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> in dealing with his current squad]</b> We are with the coach in wanting to build a competitive squad and we know the great difficulties he is having for his working methods. When I talk about focus on details, it also means being rigid in his squad structure. On the one hand, there is the need to create a team and bring in new faces, on the other the requirement to sell those who are surplus to requirements and no longer part of the project, taking nothing away from their professionalism. It’s natural that a player who is ready to leave won’t participate with too much intensity in pre-season training. It’s difficult to create a definitive team structure in such a long transfer window. I want to reiterate that <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s needs are our needs, to improve and reinforce the team</p>

We have made an offer <b>[that was]</b> fair and important, respecting the player’s value. We will monitor the situation, but I don’t feel I want to lose balance.

  <p><b>[Juventus vs Inter to be played behind closed doors due to coronavirus fears]</b> The public is a fundamental component of a football match, but there is a very clear decree, valid until Sunday at midnight. Playing behind closed doors is a forced situation, but as <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Andrea Agnelli</a> also said, the health of citizens goes safeguarded and therefore even if we grudgingly accept this decision</p>

  <p><b>[Juve vs Inter among five <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> matches rescheduled due to Coronavirus]</b> The decision was made a few hours ago by the Lega Calcio, announcing the postponement of the five matches that were meant to be played behind closed doors. It was made very, very late. As a citizen, we are in an emergency situation and so must naturally have huge respect for public health and the safeguarding of that. As a club, we are faced with a sudden change of direction. I’m already worried and looking forward, because if the regions should be locked down until March 8, I ask myself how we’re going to be able to work out next week’s matches. For example: Atalanta-Lazio, Bologna-Juve, Inter-Sassuolo etc</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus vs Inter be played this week amid coronavirus confusion]</b> I wish to point out that the whole situation was dealt with badly. It should’ve been handled much quicker, also to avoid certain allusions<br /><br /><a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> decided on Thursday that it’d play behind closed doors, then on Friday Minister for Sport <a href="vincenzo-spadafora.html">Vincenzo Spadafora</a> advised against it. At that point, the error was made by the President of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, Paolo Dal Pino, who made a decision without asking anyone.<br /><br />What he should’ve done was call an extraordinary meeting to discuss the decision with everyone together what needed to be done, to reach common ground between what the league had asked for and the Government’s indications. Instead, we just received notice that this was being done and that was that.<br /><br />This is simply not acceptable. This is why Inter asked for and were given an extraordinary meeting of the 20 league clubs for Sunday. We want to discuss the future, because what happens from now in is what worries me. I am worried for Inter-Sassuolo next Sunday. What do we do then? We cannot play behind closed doors, as it’d be absurd to use that just a week after it was considered unsuitable during a medical emergency. Closed doors is no longer an option, it has been taken off the table.<br /><br />Let’s not even talk about postponing the game to Monday, as Inter have already been damaged and paid a heavy price. We’ve got a Europa League game three days later anyway. So it’s either on Sunday with a crowd or I see no other option</p>

  <p><b>[Bianconeri promptly claimed that they were willing to play the game 24 hours later but that Inter refused]</b> Playing Juve-Inter tonight was impracticable, almost provocative hypothesis. First of all, we would have gone against the logic of protecting the public health. I don’t think that the Coronavirus alarm would have stopped within 24 hours. Secondly, because the stadium would’ve only been open to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> fans and this would have created further controversy. Thirdly, because we would have to postpone Juve-Milan of the Coppa Italia to Thursday, overlapping it with Napoli-Inter. At that point, we would have had the grievances of <a href="rai.html">Rai</a>, who are paying money for the TV rights</p>

  <p><b>[Marotta: Inter will sign a top player if Lautaro leaves]</b> It is difficult to pronounce on his future at this moment, but I say to him – stay focused on the present, there is a season that resumes, there are goals to hit. There is no desire of the property to sell Lautaro. He is young, has the future of his own and is a functional element for <b>[Antonio]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>. Then, of course, there is a clause. I don’t know what <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> think, maybe they will also have alternatives. I hope they don’t pay the clause. If Lautaro <b>[leaves]</b>, a top player will arrive. But in this market, at European level the real difficulty will not be having to buy, but being able to sell. I would say one thing in general – Neymar-style operations, in which one team goes and takes one player away from another, will not be seen for many years.<br /><br /><b>[Marotta said a deal for <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a>, who has scored seven goals in 22 games this season, was still some way off]</b> It is one of the opportunities, it is being monitored as an expiring footballer. But we did not go into the matter further: at the moment he is quite far from Inter.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter’s Marotta ‘optimistic’ Lautaro will not make <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> move]</b> It is known that he is the object of market attention. Inter is a club that does not tend to sell its best players. If he does not show his willingness to leave, we will keep him close. He is flattered by the attention of big clubs. On our part, there is the desire to keep him and he has never actually expressed the desire to leave. I am optimistic that we can continue with him again next year<br /><br />If Lautaro <b>[leaves]</b>, a top player will arrive. He is one of the players being monitored.
