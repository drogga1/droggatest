  <p><b>[Abby Wambach on the Canada 2015 decider]</b> I would never imagine the Final would go as wildly, dramatically, smoothly as it just did for us. Seven goals in the final is a little bit outrageous in my opinion, but the first 16 minutes, it seemed surreal, it seemed fake. I think I died and this is what my heaven looks like</p>

  <p><b>[Abby Wambach after she announced her decision to retire]</b> After much deliberation and talking with my friends, family, team-mates and our coaching staff, I’ve decided to finally bring my soccer career to an end. While we still have more work to do for women’s soccer, after bringing the World Cup back to the United States this summer, I’m feeling extremely optimistic about the future of our sport. It’s been an amazing, wonderful ride and I can’t wait to see what the next chapter of my life brings</p>

  <p><b>[Abby Wambach congratulates Sinclair on passing her international goalscoring record]</b> Tonight, I am celebrating the honor of passing that record, that legacy of our beautiful game, to the great Christine Sinclair: world-record holder for most international goals – man or woman – in history. Christine: History is made. Your victory is our victory. We celebrate with you</p>
