  <p><b>[New <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> signing Alphonso Davies speaks at the club’s January training camp in Doha]</b> When I was younger I would watch these guys on TV and play with them on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and now I’m meeting them in real life and playing alongside them, I was a little bit nervous. It is a great honour to play for this big club and to be on the pitch with the other players</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies says he still had aspirations to play on the wing again]</b> I’m very comfortable. It’s not a new position for me. I’ve played there before: my time with Vancouver and with the national team. Overall, it was not new to me. Like I said, I’ve played there before so playing there now is just about learning more and more about the position. I don’t have a preference. Wherever the coach wants to put me. Up, down. It doesn’t matter. I’m able to give 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies has tipped his <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> to go all the way in this season’s Champions League campaign]</b> I really feel that with the quality have we can win the Champions League. I played really well <b>[against Chelsea]</b>. I did what the coaches asked me to do, defended well, attacked well. Obviously it is not going to be easy. There are still a lot of good opponents in front of us that we have to get past. Each and every day we have that in the back of our minds, that this year could be the year that we win the Champions League again. My favourite part about <b>[Flick]</b> is that he lets us play, lets us be creative. He implements his coaching tactics, how he wants us to play, but at the end of the day, football is free-flowing. He just wants us to win games and enjoy playing our football<br /><br />Yeah, I always feel like Canada have quality footballers and with us playing so highly in Europe it opens the eyes of other teams to look at our players. Even though it snows there <b>[in Canada]</b>, even though we play hockey, we still play football. We’re good at it</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich star Davies signs new contract until 2025]</b> I am very happy. <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> is one of the best clubs in the world and it was a dream come true for me to be able to play here. I felt comfortable from day one. I want to get as many titles as possible with this club. The mentality of always wanting to win everything is <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a>’s DNA</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich starlet Alphonso Davies has admitted that he would like to move into acting one day]</b> Football comes first, but I want to be an actor eventually. I like entertaining people and TikTok gives me the platform to do so. It allows fans to not only see what I do on the field, but also to get to know my personality a bit more. And it passes the time during the corona crisis when we are all staying home.<br /><br />There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn’t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: ‘Bayern Munich want to meet you. I was like: ‘Oh my god. Really?’ It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he felt intimidated when meeting Bayern’s superstars upon his arrival in Germany]</b> Yes! I’d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was very intimidated. When <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> introduced himself to me, I just couldn’t believe it.<br /><br /><b>[on the enforced break in the season]</b> The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I’m happy for that. But it’s a tough situation right now, so I guess we just have to play our part and stay inside</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern’s Alphonso Davies envisions long-term future at left-back]</b> I’m proud of my achievement but right now thinking about it, it’s all because of the team I’m with. The team’s playing well, everyone’s playing well, and I also have a world-class left-back playing next to me helping me out as well. Having all those factors in place just makes it a lot more fun. I came out as a winger, I played as a winger a couple of games. Right now, my main attribute is left-back, I’m enjoying the position. I’m enjoying every moment of it but in the future, I still see myself as a left-back. I don’t see it changing any time soon. Obviously David’s been a top player for a long time, especially at the left-back position. Having him as my centre-back – he knows how to play at left-back, so I take feedback and advice from him. He helped me out a lot, keeping me in shape, keeping me where I’m supposed to be on the field, just giving me all the advice he got in his previous mentorship with whoever it was<br /><br /><b>[Davies is not against playing in empty stadiums]</b> If it happens it’s going to be different. The fans are part of us but it’s for the safety of everyone I guess, so I don’t really mind it. <br /><br /><b>[Davies’ international team-mate <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a> has been linked with a move to Bayern, Inter, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and others]</b> <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a> has a lot of qualities, as you can tell in the Belgian league he’s been scoring and assisting. I think if he moved over here it’d be no problem for him to play at this level. Having him on the men’s national team as well is a great honour for me to play with him</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern star Davies admits pace often comes to his rescue]</b> Obviously being a young player I get caught out of position a lot and I’m happy to have the speed I have. That’s a factor in my game that I use very well, but I think over the years going forward with this team I will definitely learn more about my position, better positioning so it doesn’t look like I’m out of position just running back as fast as I can to catch up</p>

  <p><b>[Davies embraces Road Runner nickname after latest Bayern win]</b> I know the cartoon. I saw him as a child. Yes, I’m quick. I took it as a compliment that he <b>[Muller]</b> called me Road Runner. It’s a good nickname for me. I don’t think too much about the comments. I come here every day and do what I have to do and try to win as many games as possible. We had a tough game against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> on Tuesday. We also wanted to show the mentality in this game and get the three points. We did that<br /><br /><b>[On his goal]</b> It was very special. I did my job in defence. I pushed very high, won the ball and saw that I could push it in. I am happy</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies hailed <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> as the best striker in the world after his goal clinched an eighth straight <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> title for Bayern Munich]</b> We call him ‘Lewangoalski’ for that reason. He’s a top striker, the top in the world. Coming in and scoring 31 goals, it’s unbelievable.<br /><br /><b>[Davies also took the opportunity to laud head coach Hansi Flick]</b> Incredible. He’s a good coach, he expects a lot from his players. We know we have to battle each and every game for everything<br /><br />Unfortunately, anger comes into play. I got a yellow card, apologies for that. The second yellow card, I don’t know what happened, I tried to run backwards, he came into me. It’s the referee’s decision, so I apologise to everyone. That’s not the <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> way, but I’m happy we can win the championship<br /><br /><b>[Davies had registered the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>’s fastest speed]</b> I just do my job I guess. I don’t know when that happened, I just do my job trying to get the ball back defensively. I’m happy I can break a record</p>
