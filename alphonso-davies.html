  <p><b>[Teen phenom Alphonso Davies gains Canadian citizenship]</b> I am overwhelmed and I am glad I can make my parents proud by becoming a Canadian citizen. It has been a long journey becoming a Canadian citizen.<br /><br />I am really excited to be called into Canada Soccer’s men’s national team. Canada Soccer worked extremely hard to get me where I am right now and I am very grateful. I am really glad they took their time and put the effort in me in helping me get my citizenship</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich has completed the transfer of Canadian midfielder Alphonso Davies from the Vancouver Whitecaps]</b> I am very happy with my move to Bayern. As a kid I always dreamed of such a moment. Now the dream has come true. But now the work continues, now I have to give everything to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The Canadian teenager Bayern beat out Europe’s best to buy]</b> As a player you want to play every single game, and every single minute. I think now I can see that. When I was 15, 16, they put me in little by little, I can see now at the end of these two years that it has come along beautifully and they handled things the right way.<br /><br />As a soccer player you want to perform, whether it’s in front of 72,000 or even 1,000. You always want to be your best because you never know who’s watching. Watching those players perform in the Bundesliga is eye opening because they’re not that much older than me. And me going over there I just want to play the game</p>

  <p><b>[Davies issued a heartfelt message to the club]</b> Vancouver, you took me in when I was just a kid. I was only 14, I didn’t know if I’d make it but you believed in me, you challenged me, you gave me an opportunity to play the sport that I love and realise my dream of becoming a professional footballer. For that, I’ll forever be grateful. These three years have been the best of my life. Every time I stepped on the field for this great club I tried to give my all and play with a smile on my face. You supported me every single time. I heard you every single time. You will always be part of my story and now it’s time for the next chapter. It’s time to say goodbye. Thank you Vancouver, you will always be in my heart.</p>

It is a great honour to play for this big club and to be on the pitch with the other players</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies admits it has not been easy to deal with the transition to life at Bayern Munich]</b> I’m still dealing with it. As a young footballer, it’s not easy to come from Canada and then try to play in one of the best teams in the world. It takes time, especially at a young age. It takes a lot of patience to be able to play. Yeah, you’re going to make mistakes but the players just tell me, ‘Make 100 mistakes but we know you’re learning. You learn from your mistakes.<br /><br />If you look at the team, there’s not many players you don’t want to learn from. You want to learn from everyone, but I think one of the main guys I look up to is Thiago. We play different positions but his awareness on the field, his touches, everything about him is so calm. He’s technically gifted and amazing to watch - as a teammate and as a fan. As a kid I watched him and I remember my friends talking about him<br /><br />I’m happy to get <b>[games]</b>. Coming into this team, I didn’t know where I was going to be, but the coach saw something in me in training and gave me the opportunity to play some games. Luckily I got my first goal for the club and for my Bayern Munich career, and hopefully more to come<br /><br />The injury was a tough one. The day I scored I was supposed to go to Canada with the national team. When I got injured I was devastated because I wouldn’t be able to participate in the game in Canada. It was disappointing because it was in Vancouver as well - the club I came from, the city I came from. But I’m over the injury now. I worked hard every day to make my injury better again</p>

They want to build me up, that I get my game time and that I get used to the league. It’s difficult to come over from Canada as a youngster and play for one of the best teams in the world. They’re giving me all the time I need and their plan has been very good so far.<br /><br />We’ve got a good crop of young players. KC <b>[<a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a>]</b>, Serge <b>[<a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a>]</b> and me are all young and hungry to play. I’m sure that everyone will get their chance to blossom and shine at this club. The bosses see something in Leroy, they see something in me. That’s why they bought me. That’s why they might buy him. I want to develop here. If Leroy should come to us, I can learn a lot from him. He is a top winger for his club and for his country</p>

  <p><b>[Canada is a team that puts those sort of scorelines on other teams]</b> Going into the Mexico game, we all know it’s going to be a tough one. Mexico is a top side, it will be a good test for Canada as we have a new identity, a new structure and a new team, and this will be a good opportunity for us to test ourselves. Every player on our roster is looking forward to this match, as a footballer this is where you want to be, playing against the biggest teams on the biggest stage and every player on this team is ready to give their all on Wednesday.</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies says he still had aspirations to play on the wing again]</b> I’m very comfortable. It’s not a new position for me. I’ve played there before: my time with Vancouver and with the national team. Overall, it was not new to me. Like I said, I’ve played there before so playing there now is just about learning more and more about the position. I don’t have a preference. Wherever the coach wants to put me. Up, down. It doesn’t matter. I’m able to give 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies has tipped his <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> to go all the way in this season’s Champions League campaign]</b> I really feel that with the quality have we can win the Champions League. I played really well <b>[against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>. I did what the coaches asked me to do, defended well, attacked well. Obviously it is not going to be easy. There are still a lot of good opponents in front of us that we have to get past. Each and every day we have that in the back of our minds, that this year could be the year that we win the Champions League again. My favourite part about <b>[<a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a>]</b> is that he lets us play, lets us be creative. He implements his coaching tactics, how he wants us to play, but at the end of the day, football is free-flowing. He just wants us to win games and enjoy playing our football<br /><br />Yeah, I always feel like Canada have quality footballers and with us playing so highly in Europe it opens the eyes of other teams to look at our players. Even though it snows there <b>[in Canada]</b>, even though we play hockey, we still play football. We’re good at it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> starlet Alphonso Davies has admitted that he would like to move into acting one day]</b> Football comes first, but I want to be an actor eventually. I like entertaining people and TikTok gives me the platform to do so. It allows fans to not only see what I do on the field, but also to get to know my personality a bit more. And it passes the time during the corona crisis when we are all staying home.<br /><br />There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn’t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: ‘Bayern Munich want to meet you. I was like: ‘Oh my god. Really?’ It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he felt intimidated when meeting <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s superstars upon his arrival in Germany]</b> Yes! I’d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was very intimidated. When <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> introduced himself to me, I just couldn’t believe it.<br /><br /><b>[on the enforced break in the season]</b> The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I’m happy for that.

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s Alphonso Davies envisions long-term future at left-back]</b> I’m proud of my achievement but right now thinking about it, it’s all because of the team I’m with. The team’s playing well, everyone’s playing well, and I also have a world-class left-back playing next to me helping me out as well. Having all those factors in place just makes it a lot more fun. I came out as a winger, I played as a winger a couple of games. Right now, my main attribute is left-back, I’m enjoying the position. I’m enjoying every moment of it but in the future, I still see myself as a left-back. I don’t see it changing any time soon. Obviously David’s been a top player for a long time, especially at the left-back position. Having him as my centre-back - he knows how to play at left-back, so I take feedback and advice from him. He helped me out a lot, keeping me in shape, keeping me where I’m supposed to be on the field, just giving me all the advice he got in his previous mentorship with whoever it was<br /><br /><b>[Davies is not against playing in empty stadiums]</b> If it happens it’s going to be different. The fans are part of us but it’s for the safety of everyone I guess, so I don’t really mind it.<br /><br /><b>[Davies’ international team-mate <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a> has been linked with a move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, Inter, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and others]</b> <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a> has a lot of qualities, as you can tell in the Belgian league he’s been scoring and assisting. I think if he moved over here it’d be no problem for him to play at this level. Having him on the men’s national team as well is a great honour for me to play with him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> star Davies admits pace often comes to his rescue]</b> Obviously being a young player I get caught out of position a lot and I’m happy to have the speed I have. That’s a factor in my game that I use very well, but I think over the years going forward with this team I will definitely learn more about my position, better positioning so it doesn’t look like I’m out of position just running back as fast as I can to catch up</p>
