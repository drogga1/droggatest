Soon the economy will change, and that’s at all levels: The TV rights will be less, players and coaches will earn less, tickets will cost less because people will have less money.

Then, to help <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> from being relegated, they took away some of the penalty and we were forced to qualify for the Champions League.

Of course, they have to work together because the team is the most important part of the game, but strikers like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> who are able to score every single game, you don’t have to give too much information defensively.

  <p><b>[<a href="theo-walcott.html">Theo Walcott</a> punished <a href="anwar-el-ghazi.html">Anwar El Ghazi</a>’s glaring miss by scoring a late equaliser for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park which leaves the visitors deep in relegation trouble]</b> We showed a good spirit to avoid the defeat. I think it was important as we didn’t want to lose - we want to keep our home record. We would’ve been able to win this game if we played better in the final third. We didn’t have good quality in this area, unfortunately. I want to see good spirit in the final two games. We have to try to play better and shower better quality. We have to try to avoid conceding easy balls in order to finish the season well</p>
