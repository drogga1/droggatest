  <p><b>[Man City to wear 125th anniversary shirt in Community Shield clash with Liverpool]</b> Manchester City has enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, but we also have a rich history that we are incredibly proud of. The Club’s 125th anniversary season will provide us with the opportunity to mark key moments in the life of Manchester City, and celebrate the fantastic journey that our Club and our fans have been on together</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been left bemused after Jurgen Klopp claimed Liverpool do not inhabit the same transfer ‘fantasy land’ as the Premier League champions]</b> It looks like there are four clubs in the world who can do it constantly. Madrid, Barcelona, Man City and PSG. You cannot compare that.<br /><br />We were a little bit surprised. Liverpool are a great sporting rival. I don’t know why they would make these comments. I don’t know why they would look at other clubs. It’s not frustration or anger, we just find it curious that they’d be highlighting our spending. We’re fine with their spending. The reality is that all the top clubs invest as they see fit. Saying us, PSG, Real Madrid and Barcelona always invest £200 million is not correct. We don’t look at what others do</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have criticised <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s changes to the Christmas fixture list, arguing that their congested schedule threatens the sporting integrity of the English top-flight]</b> We’re disappointed that the schedule is so tight for the players over Christmas. <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games are a huge physical demand, and it’s not ideal to be made to play twice in less than 48 hours because it doesn’t give the players time to properly recover.<br /><br />We obviously understand that the paying rights-holding broadcasters are an important consideration when it comes to scheduling, but we also need to make sure that we protect the players’ wellbeing, the sporting integrity of the league, and the quality of the product. We’ve had an open dialogue with the league to consider other options, but ultimately, we will have to comply with the kick off times and dates as they have been presented to us</p>

We remain determined to protect our people, their jobs and our business whilst at the same time doing what we can to support our wider community at this most challenging time for everybody</p>
