  <p><b>[Julie Ertz writes about playing in her first <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup match]</b> That first game day, against Australia, was like a movie, almost, the way the excitement built up. Our locker room was pretty far away from the field, so you couldn’t hear anything at first. It was so quiet. We went through our pre-game stuff in the locker room just like any other game, but as soon as we opened the doors, we could hear this faint chanting. U-S-A! U-S-A!! U-S-A!!!! It got louder and louder with every step down the tunnel. And finally, when we got out to the field, it was just like … Wow. I still get goosebumps even thinking about it. And every game it got louder and more exciting. We were in Canada, so we weren’t sure what to expect. But so many of our fans made the trip, and they kind of took over. That moment was really special</p>

  <p><b>[The effectiveness of American substitutes Carli Lloyd, Christen Press and Mallory Pugh overwhelmed the Mexicans in an eventual 3-0 triumph]</b> Definitely, I think the first half was a little disappointing. Not kind of how well we wanted to play, but I do think we had opportunities and we had some good things happen. We take from that and learn and move forward from that<br /><br />Right now it’s all about cohesion. Everything’s getting on the same page. It’s fine-tuning everything. The principles are set. We know what we’re doing there, which is great going into it because now we can really focus on finalizing those details and cleaning everything up</p>

  <p><b>[It appears that this may finally be Alex Morgan’s World Cup aftter scoring a remarkable five goals in her team’s 13-0 demolition of Thailand]</b> I think in her mind she had it set she was going to score some good goals. I’ve seen it in training, it’s no different. I don’t want to say I was surprised because I wasn’t. I’ve been</p>

  <p><b>[Julie Ertz says having husband Zach in the stands was so emotional and a huge motivator to win World Cup]</b> I couldn’t believe that our schedules aligned. He was able to be there from the second game <b>[of the tournament]</b> on, which is insane.<br /><br />Honestly, it was really emotional. I never really got the chance in such a big tournament to turn to the stands and see Zach. And they gave family seats that were right there, row 1, I got to see him during the national athem, I’m already emotional and then seeing him, my best friend, my number one supporter, I couldn’t do what I do without him<br /><br />It was so much motivation. I was like, ‘NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE WINNING BECAUSE MY HUSBAND’S <b>[HERE]</b>’. <br /><br /><b>[Let’s just say it was a wild experience for the whole Ertz family]</b> It was crazy. Obviously I’ve seen the work that Julie and all these girls have done for the past four years. Our schedules rarely line up. I’ll have a bye week during the year and I’ll fly to Canada to watch a soccer game instead of being on vacation. I thought she played unbelievable the entire tournament. The way she dominated on the pitch was so fun to watch and I was just so proud of her</p>

  <p><b>[Julie Ertz writes about playing in Philadelphia on the USWNT’s Victory Tour, where she shared the same dressing room that husband Zach usually uses for the Philadelphia Eagles]</b> It’s a pretty amazing game day in Philly. Sharing a locker with my husband and a record attendance! Philly you always show up and always amaze me. I’m usually in the stands at the Linc but today I get to see the stadium in a different view. #ertzgameday</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. Soccer has announced that Julie Ertz has been voted the 2019 U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year]</b> It’s been a whirlwind of a year and one that I’m extremely grateful for. My team lifted me up in so many ways and our experiences on and off the field in 2019 just encapsulate the love I have for the national team and for wearing this crest and what it represents<br /><br />All of my teammates just had such an amazing year and we all know it takes an entire team to win a World Cup or have a successful club season. We are all a sum of the people around us, so I want to especially thank (my husband) Zach and my family, all my coaches for the national team and the Red Stars, and all my teammates for their never-ending support. It’s emotional to be recognized in this way and it’s a cherry on top of a beautiful 2019. It’s incredible</p>
