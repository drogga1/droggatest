  <p><b>[on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> Harry was always someone who was going to get better just by the sheer volume of work he was willing to do, and by the mentality he would demonstrate on a daily basis to invest in himself. He had a fantastic desire to improve and would always want to do extra work at the end of a session. He became obsessive about his finishing in all its various forms and would dedicate a huge amount of time to improve these aspects of his game</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> I first saw Harry when, as the under-18 coach, I would take the under-14s once a week. Harry would have been 13 at the time, and given that his is a late July birthday, he was still playing catch up with some of the group from a physical perspective. But he was always a promising technician and a very genuine young man with a wonderful desire to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Inside Liverpool’s thriving Academy]</b> It comes down to common sense, really. Ideally, you want to be working off a pyramid, where the numbers get fewer as you get closer to the first-team. We were working off more of a rectangle!<br /><br />It’s easier to promote from within. You’re creating opportunities for boys who need different challenges. It’s stopped players from stagnating, which is what was needed<br /><br />Absolutely. You have to be careful that you don’t miss out on players, and we are in a very competitive part of the world. But you have to remember, you’re dealing with children. I don’t know how you were at 17? I was quite sensible and not too flash or ostentatious, but give me X thousand pound a week and I am not sure I could have coped. It would have changed me. I’ve seen players paid an awful lot when they’re young, and I can’t think of too many examples where they have fulfilled their potential. But I’ve seen players paid enough to live on, wages which kept them humble and hungry. Those players, I have quite a long list of the ones who came through. They were players who weren’t given too much too young, who weren’t paid to fail. There are enough examples in the game now of players who have been kept hungry. That was why we chose to bring our wages in line. It’s the right thing to do<br /><br />If you are training and playing with the first team you will be looked after.<br /><br />Trent probably hasn’t done us any favours! But what he has done is he’s shown us it is possible. There’s no blueprint, no book I can give you to say ‘this is how you make a player’. Some players like Trent can, through talent and a little bit of luck, find a way to get in and stay in. But that’s hard, and not everyone can do it. Others may need to do it a different way, they may need 200 games on loan first. Everyone’s different<br /><br /><b>[Inglethorpe admits he can be a hard man to please]</b> It’s a process, not an outcome. We don’t want a player’s best moment in football to be their debut, or winning the Youth Cup. If that’s the highlight, then we’ve failed. It should always be ‘what’s next?’ I don’t look at league tables, because I think it alters the opinion you have and the decision-making process. I’m very lucky. The owners - Mike Gordon, Michael Edwards - they will never ask me where we are in the league. If we are top of the league or we win the Youth Cup, I’m never going to get a text or an email or a phone call saying ‘well done’. The only question I get asked consistently is ‘who’s next?’ We could win the Youth Cup for the next 10 years running, and if there’s no player coming through to the first-team then I am out of a job, and rightly so<br /><br />I appreciate it, and I’m very lucky. It’s an exciting time, especially with the first-team moving to Kirkby <b>[in 2020]</b>. Sometimes you have to recognise when you’ve got it good, and when the club has got it good. Because one thing that football teaches you is that it won’t stay that way forever.</p>

  <p><b>[He can count Harry Kane, Harry Winks and Danny Rose among his former pupils]</b> I’ve been very fortunate to have worked at both clubs. And I appreciate how lucky I am. Two great clubs, full of wonderful experiences.<br /><br />You learn to adapt. There’s always something you can learn, even if sometimes it’s what not to do. It’s what makes the job fun, I suppose<br /><br />His story is one I use. It makes it easier in my mind that I know what I’m doing, and that I believe in what I am doing. And it shows there is more than one way to make it as a player. Harry was young when he made his Spurs debut. He played against Hearts in the Europa League. He missed a penalty. But he then had to go on a journey after that, he had to experience some ups and some downs. Then he comes back and after accruing probably 100 games elsewhere, and he’s in a position to make his mark. It set him on his way. That tends to be the difference, that experience. I’ve said this before, but a 17-year-old Mo Salah wouldn’t take the place of a 26-year-old Mo Salah. The only thing that separates them is 200 games somewhere. I think we have to bear that in mind sometimes<br /><br />We’ve had world-class players in the past. Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, David Beckham. They’ve been here, but we’ve not really been able to put them into a world-class style of play. For years we seemed obsessed with playing two up front, for example, and didn’t know how to fit in three midfielders. Now, it feels like we have a better idea of how to set teams up and how to get the best out of world-class talents. You look back 15 years, England couldn’t find a way to fit Gerrard, Scholes and Frank Lampard into a team? It’s cringeworthy! But I think the language around football has changed. We were behind the times for years. We didn’t understand counter-pressing or playing between the lines. Nobody spoke that way. But we have had a lot of influences in the Premier League, and now we speak the same footballing language as the Germans and the Dutch and the Portuguese. What that enables us to do at youth level and then with Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b> at the senior team, we think we can give our best talent the opportunity to play in a way which is very similar to the way they play at club level<br /><br />That can only help. Let’s be honest, the Champions League is the toughest competition there is, in terms of the longevity and the quality of it. Playing in that competition and reaching the latter stages, reaching finals, it can only be good for English players. This year <b>[in the final]</b> you’ve got so many players that could potentially play for England, and now they will have one or two Champions League finals under their belts. That can only help the national team</p>

Harry has got real ability and he influences games, so I’m interested to see what happens when he gets the opportunity to play regularly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Can he step up another level because he has proven he can do it in the Championship? Hopefully he can carry that on in the Premier League<br /><br />We thought we would give it a go this year and are probably in a slighter better position with the players that we have on loan <b>[than before]</b>. We were maybe a little bit light on numbers and I think some games we might have to go into where we are a bit younger than we would want and maybe it will be a tough evening for us. But we are prepared to give it as good a go as we possibly can and it’s three great games for the kids to experience something which is close to senior football. There will be a crowd, there will be something riding on the game, they will be playing against senior players that will offer something completely different to U23s football, which is really just an extension of youth-team football</p>

  <p><b>[Academy manager Alex Inglethorpe billing <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> as more <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> than <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> as a real threat]</b> <a href="caoimhin-kelleher.html">Caoimhin Kelleher</a> made some good saves at key times and showed real calmness with his feet. It’s just good to see <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> back after so long out injured. It will probably take him a bit of time to find his rhythm. When you haven’t played for that length of time it can sometimes take a bit out of you so we need to be patient. Harvey looked a real threat and is someone we were very fortunate to be able to recruit. He’s got an incredible mentality and a lot of potential. At the minute he’s spending the majority of his time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and he will only benefit from training with the likes of <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> and <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Georginio Wijnaldum</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Inglethorpe added on Dutch defender Ki-Jana Hoever and Merseyside native Jones]</b> I thought Ki-Jana had a mixed evening but he took his goal ever so well and has shown that he’s capable of progressing. Curtis was excellent in possession and looked a real threat. He has been outstanding in the Under-23s games so far this season and having that run of games has helped him. He’s got bigger, stronger and gained more experience. I think Curtis can play in two positions - left of the front three and in midfield, too. He’s possibly more <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> than <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> in terms of his approach and capabilities<br /><br />I’m not saying debuts are easy to come by, because they’re not. When they come along, it’s fantastic for the boys and great for morale, but the truth is that there’s a big difference between playing a cup game like that and being chosen to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> regularly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Champions League. What you hope the boys do is take the opportunity they’re given and show the manager that they can be trusted. The staff here have been around the block a few times. They understand that getting a debut is a nice start but there’s an awfully long way to go. I just think the entire club benefits from having a manager who is fearless. That certainly makes my life easier, having a manager who only really plays what he sees. If he sees a young player doing better than an older player, he will play him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> U23s boss <a href="neil-critchley.html">Critchley</a> leaves to take Blackpool manager’s job]</b> It’s a bittersweet day in many respects. Obviously losing a person and professional of Neil’s calibre is something that is a disappointment, but at the same time we have great excitement and joy that he has been given this wonderful opportunity.<br /><br />We see this as a reflection on the Academy as a whole, that it’s an environment where players and coaches have a pathway to progression and self-improvement. Blackpool want Neil because of the work he’s done at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and it shows to everyone within our system that if you work hard and work smart then rewards are there.<br /><br />Neil epitomises the best qualities of a modern coach: leadership skills, intelligence, compassion and a hunger for individual and collective improvement. Blackpool are very fortunate to have him and we wish him well. For the U23s we are confident in the remaining coaching talent we have to make sure there is no drop-off in the interim period. This season has proved the importance of the role and, therefore, we will take advantage of having amazing people already in post to take stock and assess what to do next. Myself, Michael Edwards and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jürgen Klopp</a> will work collaboratively on what works best for the future. Pathway is so critical to this club we want to make sure we make the best appointment we can</p>
