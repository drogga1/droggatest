  <p><b>[Tottenham lose to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and become first English side to concede seven in Europe since their ‘mercenaries’ were thrashed 8-0 by Cologne. Then manager Gerry Francis, who was not even at the game]</b> We qualified in seventh place and got to the semi-final of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup so we were the top London club at the time.<br /><br />I think we were under the impression we didn’t have to play in the Intertoto Cup. But we found ourselves in a situation where the club got a letter telling us we had to play or be banned from Europe.<br /><br />I remember that we had all of our pre-season already set up for the following season. These games were in June and July. It was absolutely ridiculous. It was an unbelievably unusual situation really.<br /><br />We had no players. We were all looking at players just to see if we could get a team out that was the best standard we could manage. We got some sort of permission to bring players in. <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a> was one of them</p>

  <p><b>[Gerry Francis says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is the right man to deliver success at Spurs]</b> I can see why the club’s chairman <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> wanted to get <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, because everything else is in place; the stadium and the team. What you haven’t got is trophies. And whatever people say about <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, he does bring trophies. Jose has won more trophies in his career than <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have won in their whole history<br /><br />They moved up under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, but you still look at it and say, ‘What’s he won?’ Getting to the Champions League final was a magnificent achievement, but do people remember second places? <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>’s team has been excellent, with the pressing football he brought from Southampton and the flair his team played with. I enjoyed watching them, they played great stuff and you always felt that on their day they could beat anyone. He did so well in so many ways. Off the field the club has grown fantastically to have the best stadium and the best training facilities in the country if not the whole of Europe. But he was there more than five years - and what was won? Mauricio really needed to win a trophy, whether it was the League Cup or <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. It helps all round with a club if you can win trophies - certainly with the players who become even more hungry to win silverware. Because that’s really what it’s all about, winning silverware. That defines your period at a club in football history<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho is considered to be a risk worth taking after a period of stability and progress under Pochettino]</b> The pattern has been for Jose to win trophies in the first or second season, and then for complications and problems to arise. That happened at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He comes with some baggage, but also a glittering array of trophies. The question to be answered now, for me, is can <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> and Jose have a relationship that works? And will the fans accept <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> trying to win things with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> using a methodical style of football?<br /><br />Jose has a tremendous record, he is a serial winner, and it’s built on getting a lead and then closing a match out. That’s exactly what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> haven’t done in recent times; they’ve been 2-0 up and not won the match, and they have kept losing leads. He will get <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> organised, he plays the way he plays; you could call it winning football, I suppose. To win titles you need to be a consistent side winning matches all through the season. Will winning titles or cups make up for not playing with much flair week in, week out? I am certain that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans want to win things, but they also love the club’s tradition of playing with style</p>
