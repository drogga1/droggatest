  <p><b>[Former Chelsea captain John Terry has signed an extended contract to remain as Aston Villa assistant coach until 2021]</b> am really pleased that JT has extended his current deal as he is a pleasure to work with. We have had a successful start to our Villa coaching careers and JT has been instrumental in joining myself, Richard O’Kelly and Neil Cutler. He has complemented the team that we have and I have no doubts he will go on to be a top manager in the years to come. Our focus now is on the coming season and to try to continue the progress we have had in the past eight months.</p>

They were a top 10 club last season. Their defensive organisation is good, they’re tough to breach and they are very well coached.

He works hard in training, he’s scoring goals at international level as well, so he just needs to keep on with that improvement. I’ve no doubt he will because he has a great head on his shoulders.

All Jack can control at the moment is his performances, performing the way he is in an <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> shirt. He just keeps putting more pressure on those who have to select them squads. I certainly don’t envy them with the talent they’ve got to choose from but, for me, Jack’s getting better and better.

I’ll sit down with them and see what we’re going to do and how quickly we’re going to do it. Our only fit striker at the club at the minute is Jonathan Kodija.

There’s a certain risk attached to the return to training for all players and I think they want to make sure they tick the boxes so it’s safe to do so. We’ve got a player who is asthmatic, we’ve got a player whose mother-in-law is in remission and living with the family. You have to be very careful, certainly the transmission knows no boundaries. From what I’m told, we have to be led by the government at the moment. There’s a lot of hypothetical questions out there at the moment but until we get the guidance from the government about how they want to move forward out of this lockdown there are a lot more questions than there are answers at this moment. The players’ health and safety is paramount and if they’re not comfortable to return then you have to return without them, when it’s safe to do so. We have to listen to our players, we have to listen to their concerns. If the protocols say we can move forward then the ones who can do will do so.<br /><br />The season is fast-paced, you finish one game and you’re already planning for the next game and this gives us that chance to just pause, reset, reflect and hopefully move forward and be better for it</p>

One thing I allow my players is the fact they use their common sense and social distance. There have been questions whether he asked for permission - he doesn’t need to ask me for permission to go and stand up for something he believes in, just like my players don’t have to ask me for permission to go to a supermarket where there is as much chance of contracting the virus. You can’t ignore what is happening in the world and we feel strongly about it. We have players who are very passionate about it as well and they have our full support<br /><br />Timing is never good to lose a parent but he is probably in a better place now because he hadn’t been well for a long time so it was one of those things you have to deal with. He was in the care home when he contracted coronavirus but he was asymptomatic and then three days later we had a call that he had been taken to hospital by paramedics. Obviously it was tough for my mum because she couldn’t see him for 11 weeks.

They feel stung by criticism, you are going to get criticism when you’re in a position we’re in. Their job is to prove people wrong. Without a doubt, we have seen a better <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> after the break. The points tally hasn’t shown that, we played <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> last week and they are pushing for the Champions League and there was nothing between the two teams. The only quality on show was the goal. If we manage to stay up this season, which I believe we will, there will be a better <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> next year<br /><br />I’ve still not been relegated as a manager and I don’t expect to be this season either. I’ve been in ‘great escapes’. I was at Walsall when we were eight points adrift. This isn’t adrift. This is a six-team battle. Only two of the teams in the bottom six have won <b>[since <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> restart]</b> and both were in the last minute: Brighton against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We’re all battling for points. Every day you’re drawing on experiences you’ve had. At Walsall we were eight points adrift and the following season was a battle as well and we managed to come through that by being a team that was together.</p>

  <p><b>[Dean Smith: <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s fixture congestion was valid concern]</b> The rest has been really beneficial - we’ve had to recover because that was such an intense period. I think I got battered because people thought I was making excuses but I wasn’t. We went into the restart having played a game less than everyone and then 10 days later we’ve played a game more. If <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> had said the same thing I think everybody would be sitting up and taking notice. I was just frustrated at the scheduling but we’ve been given seven days to recover now and we’re physically and mentally recovered to take on the champions. <br /><br />I’m a little bit with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> on this because they had as many chances as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, their attitude was spot on. Will there be a backlash? I think it’ll be a similar performance to what they put in on Thursday night. I don’t think there’s any issue with attitude with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are capable of doing that to any team. We made <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> work really hard to get the victory over us at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Villa Park</a> and we were three minutes away from getting the win ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane and <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> kept up below-par <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s perfect home record in their 2-0 win over struggling Aston Villa]</b> I’m disappointed and I don’t want to be a valiant loser because we’re scrapping for points at the moment and running out of games. The game plan was excellent, to outshoot <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at home, the champions at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, in terms of efforts on goal is excellent but we’ve got find better quality in the final third.

  <p><b>[Bruno Fernandes: <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> head coach Dean Smith wary of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s ‘main man’]</b> It’s a tough task but no tougher than going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and playing against <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> - three of the best strikers and now champions. Now we’ve got to do the same against a team who are full of confidence and the main man to watch is Fernandes who’s been outstanding for them<br /><br /><b>[Villa haven’t beaten United at home in the league since a 1-0 win in August 1995, but Smith feels his players can go into the match with confidence]</b> Hopefully this will be the first <b>[league win since 1995]</b>. United are a very good team, we know that. They’ve improved, and as I said Fernandes is playing very well. They’ve got pace and power up front as well but they conceded a couple of goals against Bournemouth at the weekend and Bournemouth took the lead. There’s a lot of heart we can take certainly from our performance against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and we’re going to need that sort of performance again, but we need to be better in the final third and take our chances when they come<br /><br /><b>[Despite being without a win in 10 games in all competitions]</b> We don’t see it as a long time without a win because we’ve just played five games. We knew this was like a new season, we can’t be looking at form from four months ago. I know statisticians will do that but the belief is there because the players know that they have played well enough to win games. We’ve just got to look at our next game. If we beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> then it’s back to a point and that’s all we can concentrate on. If we draw then it’s back to three points so it’s still in our hands because <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> have to play <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> as well, so there’s an awful lot to play for still.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United produced another unerring attacking display to sweep struggling <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> aside 3-0, but only after a contentious penalty unlocked the door at Villa Park]</b> It unravelled with the first goal. We made a bright start, had some chances, they are always a threat on the counter, but it all changed round on the penalty decision. I can understand Jon <b>[Moss]</b> getting it wrong but I don’t know what VAR are looking at - it’s a disgraceful decision. They have a screen they can go and look at it, but they don’t seem to be bothered</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Fernandes won a penalty despite looking like he committed the foul]</b> It all turned around on the penalty decision. I can understand Jon Moss getting it wrong but that goes to VAR, I don’t know what they are looking at. It’s a disgraceful decision. I can’t really tell you what I think about it as I’ll get fined. It’s a poor decision. They’ve got a screen they can go to and look at but they don’t seem to be bothered now. Anybody who has been in football knows Fernandes is trying to do a drag back. His first foot is on the ball and his second is on Konsa’s shin. I thought he was going to give a foul the other way</p>

  <p><b>[Dean Smith insists <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> is not leaving <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> for Bristol City manager’s job]</b> I have spoken to John and he is fully committed to our cause here at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. I don’t think we can look at the summer, we’ve got to look at now. They’ve got <a href="dean-holden.html">Dean Holden</a>, a former coach of mine, in charge at the moment.

Our concentration now is fully on Crystal Palace. They won their first game after lockdown at Bournemouth 2-0 but they’ve lost their last four. I watched their last game against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and they were very good, they were very unfortunate they didn’t get a result in that game. We have to just make sure we concentrate on ourselves and that we are performing to the levels we can. Now we face a team in Crystal Palace we feel we can be competitive against rather than the internationals at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester United</p>

We have to go into these games believing that we can win every single one of them. The heart and the spirit are there, and we have to make sure that we maintain that. We are fighting for our lives, the players know what it means and they know what is at stake. I’ve been in situations like this before, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> is my life at the moment and we’re doing everything we can<br /><br />We have to be better, but we created chances against two of the top teams. The lads showed great belief and character against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and if a decision went our way, it would’ve been close against United. We know how important these last four games are for our season. We know that this is a run where we can be more competitive.</p>

It’s really big. It’s the first leg of a semi-final, and we’ve managed to win that, and we’ve got a second leg at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. It was a good performance and I think we deserved it today; we were worthy winners. It was a more attacking line-up today; we felt we’d have a lot more of the ball than we have against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, and it paid dividends.

So it was nice to get that victory and it was a well-deserved victory too. Hopefully we will take a lot from that. Something had to change for us and thankfully it did against Palace. We felt we were really competitive in that game and we’ll be really competitive against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. The lads will have to do that again but getting that win has given everyone a lift<br /><br />The players have all played under pressure before so they know what it’s about and we’ve got quite a lot of the players who were in the play-off winning team last year back now. They know what the pressure is like of playing in those types of games where the pressure is really on. This is tournament football now and we’ve got the players who can handle the pressure of tournament football</p>

We had a few chances to take the lead before we did, and then we missed a massive chance to go 2-0 up with El Ghazi putting it over the bar. Defensively, I thought we were good as we didn’t concede too many opportunities against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I thought in the last eight minutes we got a bit sloppy on the ball and didn’t take as much pressure off ourselves as we needed to. For the previous 82 minutes we showed really good composure. We gave the ball back to them too easily in the final eight minutes which allowed them to put pressure on</p>
