  <p><b>[Brosque went down following a challenge from Western Sydney defender Rob Cornthwaite in the 92nd minute]</b> It’s a good test to be honest. The reality is we’ve lost one game all season. For <b>[the Wanderers]</b>, they’ve needed something this year and they got a good win so good on them. But we’ll just keep doing what we’ve been doing all year, playing well. We’ll pick ourselves up for Melbourne City and get three points over there</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque claimed the Sky Blues specifically plotted a fast start against Perth Glory in order to make a statement in their semi-final]</b> We wanted to make a bit of a statement tonight with the way we came out and the intent we had. It’s been a fantastic year and to back it up again tonight after a week off… we had time to freshen up and plan exactly what we were going to do tonight and we did it perfectly. We’ve set ourselves up perfectly now with a home grand final and we’ll get the job done next week.<br /><br />I give it a good look every morning when I wake up. It’s just reminding me what’s at stake and what’s there to be won. It’s a great group, fantastic players, fantastic team. But it is all about the trophy and that medal</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque has signed a new one-year contract with the A-League champions]</b> I’m very happy to be staying on for another year. After the incredible highs of the season just gone we want to carry that on into next year and have another successful season. I believe we’ll be even better next year, retaining the core of the squad, and I’m looking forward to season 2017-18 getting underway</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s comfortable 3-0 win over Sydney FC on Wednesday night is a reminder that the level of quality is miles apart between the Premier League and A-League]</b> Obviously they touched us up a bit in the first half there but it’s good to see the difference, the sharpness, the quickness of the brain, how they think. It’s definitely miles apart.</p>
