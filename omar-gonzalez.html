<p>: 2019 06 03
Toronto FC has signed United States international defender Omar Gonzalez from Liga MX club Atlas.</p>

<h4 id="2019-06-04-retrieve">2019 06 04 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[USMNT teammates Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore helped convince Omar Gonzalez to join Toronto FC] I know from speaking with Jozy in the past, how much he loves being in Toronto, loves playing for the club. That speaks volumes about a place. With Michael, we were roommates in last camp back in March. Mike was talking to me about what the possibilities could be - just us having a conversation - spoke really highly about the club, the city. It really made my decision easy.<br /><br />[The 2018 season was a disappointment for Toronto FC. Despite those struggles, Toronto has been a dominant force in MLS over the last half decade] For the past few years, I’ve been keeping a close eye on Toronto and when the opportunity arose to come back and they were first in the allocation list, it just made sense because they’re such strong team, have a streak of making it in late into the playoffs, and have aspirations of winning a Concacaf title. That’s everything that I want to be a part of</p>
