  <p>[Omar Gonzalez concerned about Donald Trump’s rhetoric] I didn’t vote for him. There’s fear here in Mexico, but there’s also fear in the United States. There are a lot of people who didn’t want him to be their president, but that’s how things go. Hopefully the way he talked in the campaign, hopefully he’s not going to keep talking like this and will treat people as they should be treated. But I’m a bit worried about the people he’s put in place: A lot of rich people with a lot of money who don’t have any idea how poor people live their lives or their values.<br /><br />It’s another game. Every game is different. It’s not revenge, it’s another chance to be better than them</p>

  <p>[USMNT teammates <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a> and <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Jozy Altidore</a> helped convince Omar Gonzalez to join Toronto FC] I know from speaking with Jozy in the past, how much he loves being in Toronto, loves playing for the club. That speaks volumes about a place. With Michael, we were roommates in last camp back in March. Mike was talking to me about what the possibilities could be - just us having a conversation - spoke really highly about the club, the city. It really made my decision easy.<br /><br />[The 2018 season was a disappointment for Toronto FC. Despite those struggles, Toronto has been a dominant force in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> over the last half decade] For the past few years, I’ve been keeping a close eye on Toronto and when the opportunity arose to come back and they were first in the allocation list, it just made sense because they’re such strong team, have a streak of making it in late into the playoffs, and have aspirations of winning a Concacaf title. That’s everything that I want to be a part of</p>
