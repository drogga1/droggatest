  <p><b>[Omar Gonzalez concerned about Donald Trump’s rhetoric]</b> I didn’t vote for him. There’s fear here in Mexico, but there’s also fear in the United States. There are a lot of people who didn’t want him to be their president, but that’s how things go. Hopefully the way he talked in the campaign, hopefully he’s not going to keep talking like this and will treat people as they should be treated. But I’m a bit worried about the people he’s put in place: A lot of rich people with a lot of money who don’t have any idea how poor people live their lives or their values.<br /><br />It’s another game. Every game is different. It’s not revenge, it’s another chance to be better than them</p>

  <p><b>[As Pachuca and FC Dallas battled for continental supremacy, Hirving Lozano showed he reigns supreme in the region]</b> I think he’s one of the most dynamic players I’ve ever played with. He can just make things happen. Landon Donovan was one of those players. He had a lot of speed and was very technical and stuff like that, so maybe he’s comparable to Landon in a way, but Chucky Lozano is just tearing it up right now. I’m happy he’s on my team.</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca center back Omar Gonzalez says the team has had a promising start to preparations ahead of a must-win match Saturday against Club America]</b> This game against America is all or nothing. This is the first week where we’ve been able to have a good, full week of training because since March we’ve had two or three games a week, which didn’t give us the chance to train well. So, this week has started well, we’re giving everything because we know we have to go to the Azteca at 100 percent to be able to win.<br /><br /><b>[On Oscar Perez]</b> No, but it was impressive and it’s really great that El Conejo scored the goal to save us. He was the hero Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Gonzalez hails Arena’s USA preparation]</b> When he told me that we were playing in that system I was a little bit nervous because of the way the last time turned out in Columbus. We’ve prepared very well these last two weeks tactically and it worked out great.<br /><br /><b>[Gonzalez’s initial fears were quickly replaced by the comfort of knowing he and his teammates would be able to prepare in a way they weren’t able]</b> I was relieved that I knew that early, for sure. I’ve had three weeks to prepare for this game. It’s just a different environment, and a different mentality you can take when you know three weeks out when you’re going to play, how you’re going to prepare. Sometimes with Jurgen you wouldn’t know until the day of the game. It’s just stressful, so with Bruce here taking that kind of approach here, it’s been helping out a lot<br /><br />Going into the last game it was a maybe that we were going to use a 3-5-2. We didn’t know until a couple of days before the game and then it was just thrown out there. Now we had two weeks to really prepare. One team was preparing to play against Trinidad in a 4-4-2, and the other team was preparing in a 3-5-2. We’ve been playing this now for a few weeks and so that’s the reason there was a lot better understanding tonight, and the reason it worked for us tonight<br /><br />Bruce is very open, clear with players, straightforward. I like that approach and it’s been great so far. We’ve turned things around since November. Now we’re in third place <b>[in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying]</b> and I couldn’t be happier<br /><br />You saw how things can turn out when you don’t really prepare that properly and you’re confused and you don’t know who’s going to start. Things can turn out bad, like losing at home.</p>

  <p><b>[On Tim Howard]</b> Teams are going to get behind <b>[the defense]</b> sometimes, and teams are going to get their chances, but we know that <b>[Howard]</b> is going to come big for us. Just like he did last game against Costa Rica. They only got in behind twice but both times he came up huge. It’s a big confidence booster for the defense knowing we can count on him.</p>

  <p><b>[Panama qualifier is the USMNT’s biggest match in 15 years]</b> We’re in a position now where it’s do or die, and we all understand that. We all understand what needs to be done, how we need to step out on the field, the focus that we need to have, the match intensity we need to have throughout the 90 minutes-plus.</p>

It’s one that will haunt me forever. I just want to say sorry to the fans. We let down an entire nation today</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Gonzalez relishing Club World Cup date with Gremio]</b> We are looking forward to it. They’re a very good team to win Copa Libertadores. It’s a great accomplishment for anyone. They’re going to come here fresh off that win straight into the semis.<br /><br />We’re a pretty young team. We’ve got a lot of young players. There were a bit of nerves at the beginning. As the game went on we settled down find more of the ball, control the game. I thought we looked pretty strong throughout the 120 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT teammates <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a> and <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Jozy Altidore</a> helped convince Omar Gonzalez to join Toronto FC]</b> I know from speaking with Jozy in the past, how much he loves being in Toronto, loves playing for the club. That speaks volumes about a place. With Michael, we were roommates in last camp back in March. Mike was talking to me about what the possibilities could be - just us having a conversation - spoke really highly about the club, the city. It really made my decision easy.<br /><br /><b>[The 2018 season was a disappointment for Toronto FC. Despite those struggles, Toronto has been a dominant force in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> over the last half decade]</b> For the past few years, I’ve been keeping a close eye on Toronto and when the opportunity arose to come back and they were first in the allocation list, it just made sense because they’re such strong team, have a streak of making it in late into the playoffs, and have aspirations of winning a Concacaf title. That’s everything that I want to be a part of</p>
