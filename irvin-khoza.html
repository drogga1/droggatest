  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates chairman Dr Irvin Khoza has revealed that he wanted to keep Eric Tinkler at the club before Cape Town City acquired his services at the beginning of last season]</b> What defines a coach is their work ethic. Tinkler is defined by that. Tinkler is hands on. That is why it was not easy for me to let him go. I wanted to maintain him in the team, but unfortunately he got a very good offer, and I’m happy <b>[that]</b> he’s doing very well<br /><br />You see‚ my selection of Tinkler was not misplaced. It was a good choice, but unfortunately the supporters were impatient, and a lot of people are impatient‚ but we see things that they don’t see, because when they never saw anything in Tinkler. I saw something in Tinkler, and I’m happy it’s been proven right that my choice was the correct choice<br /><br />When he went to Cape Town City, he won a trophy <b>[Telkom Knockout Cup]</b>. Now he’s in a final <b>[MTN8]</b> and a semifinal <b>[Caf Confederation Cup]</b>. So, there’s nothing new about Tinkler because we have prepared him for that. He’s been in the final of the Confederation Cup. He’s been in three finals in the country<br /><br />Unfortunately he and Roger <b>[De Sa]</b> were unlucky not to win the Champions League, but it’s also very important that the class of 1996 are coming now to take their rightful position‚ and not only becoming armchair critics. Tinkler is one of the guys who is prepared to be tested and to be audited - not one of those who just go into the TV studio just to critique</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza says they are looking to sharpen up their attack during the upcoming January Transfer Window]</b> We are no longer conceding goals like we did last season. Our technical team has instilled discipline at the back. We just wanted to find balance at the back because we were not 100 percent. We hope that Maphanga, and Diamond will give us that balance. We need to beef up upfront now.</p>
