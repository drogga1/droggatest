But if we can continue along this path then I am sure we will achieve great things. We will have to be careful against Genoa as they have good strikers, but we are preparing well and I have faith</p>

  <p><b>[Stephan Lichtsteiner says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> still believe they can win the Champions League despite losing a fifth consecutive final]</b> Dear Juventino. I found myself in a moment of sadness and I decided to share some thoughts with you. Despite the many titles won in the past six years, despite the many beautiful and unique moments we shared together… there’s still something missing, and I know I am not the only one who thinks so. In three years we have reached two Champions League finals, coming a step away from realising our dream. Close to the finish line. We Juventino now have wanted for over 20 years to bring home this cup. I personally have dreamed of it for 33 years<br /><br />Losing again in the final… it really hurts… rather badly. And it is a very difficult time to deal with. Although we wrote a piece of unique history by winning six consecutive league titles, we are very down in the dumps! An immense frustration. But, dear Juventino… even now, this makes us strong and we never give up! We will rebuild and sooner or later we will win this title too! We must continue to believe it! Until The End!</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar has been accused of going to ground a lot during Brazil’s 1-1 draw with Switzerland at World Cup 2018]</b> It’s very difficult playing him. He’s fast, he’s technical, you need to keep up with him all the time because he’s dangerous. It’s a big challenge. And I was a little bit worried about the referee. Every time he fell down it was a whistle, a foul so that was a bit of a challenge. You think to yourself ‘don’t be too aggressive’ because every time he goes down it’s a foul. So, because of that, I had to be a bit careful.<br /><br />We knew Neymar was a danger so it was very good teamwork on the right side with Valon Behrami, Fabian Schaer and me closing him down. It was almost a perfect game. It’s important to have this teamwork in the next game because we’ll have new situations. Maybe it’s an advantage to play a big team like Brazil first in the group. Maybe they don’t know us that well, they don’t have the feeling for the tournament. The first game is never easy for a big team in the first game. But Switzerland have a good team - and we got a good point</p>

  <p><b>[Lichtsteiner defends <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> &amp; <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a>’s controversial celebration]</b> We had a lot of pressure, it was not an easy game for us. We have a lot of Albanians, so there is a lot of history between Serbia and Albania. It was a very tough game for them mentally<br /><br />It was good. Why not? This is the history for them. The war between them was so difficult. I spoke to the father of one of our players who is Albanian, and he told me about this history. This is more than football. This is more than football because they have this period, this war that gave them both big problems. I understand them. I think it’s normal, it’s part of their life. There was also big provocation ahead of the game from them <b>[Serbia]</b>, so I think it’s normal<br /><br /><b>[Switzerland play Costa Rica in their final group game, with a win guaranteeing their progress to the knockout stage. Lichtsteiner feels that beating Serbia was a huge help to their tournament goals, feeling that their European opponents offered a different challenge to Brazil following a 1-1 draw in their opening game]</b> I’m very happy. We made a great step to get past the group, this was our objective. We had a tough first-half, we were not very good, but in the second-half, we came out and gave Serbia problems. It was different to Brazil. Brazil is a team with very different qualities. It is also a good team, this Serbia team</p>

  <p><b>[New Arsenal signing Stephan Lichsteiner has praised Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic]</b> Matic is an amazing player. Also as a player, I like him a lot. I have heard from many people that he his a nice person. He has amazing qualities and is an amazing character<br /><br /><b>[The new Arsenal signing also had praise for former Premier League players Xherdan Shaqiri and Aleksandar Kolarov]</b> I am very happy with Shaqiri. Very happy. He played very well, as did all our players. Kolarov is also very good. I like the Serbian team. But there is this history between them and the Albanians in our team, so it was not easy</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Stephan Lichtsteiner has confirmed that he is happy with his current role in the Gunners set-up]</b> I’m 35 years old, I need a little more recovery time. I’m not angry if I do not play from the start. And yes, I’m in a good health. I have had a top career. I am calm. I enjoy it. Arsenal is a top club. It’s clear that playing there is always more difficult. I came to a new country, a new club. I had to get to know a new culture, new people, a new league, a new tactic.<br /><br />This will need time. The fact that I play at a top club at the age of 35 says enough. There have been talks <b>[with Arsenal]</b>. We have to see if it suits both sides. Arsenal is a big club, I feel very happy. But I want to play regularly with regard to the European Championships. It was okay this year. But if the coach says that he no longer counts on me, I have to worry</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Stephan Lichtsteiner expects to leave the club this summer at the end of his 12-month contract]</b> I see it being quite difficult to stay but we are going to see what happens. I don’t know anything. The only important thing is the Europa League final now. I really want to win this cup and bring this club back to the top level, back to the Champions League and winning important titles<br /><br /><b>[Lichtsteiner had a solid <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> career with <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and then <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and was recruited largely as back-up for right-back <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a>]</b> It is hard. Five weeks ago, we were in the perfect situation. We gave too many easy points in our away games. We were also a little bit unlucky but we have to ask more from ourselves. At the end, of course, with so many games and the Europa League and everything, we lost a bit of energy in the last games.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Lichtsteiner confirms Gunners departure]</b> Dear Gunners, we were close to add an important chapter to this amazing club’s history. But to be close is unfortunately not good enough. This is hard to accept. I’m very disappointed. It was our objective to bring <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> back on the highest international level and to win trophies. Both belong to this great club. I wish my teammates, my coach and his staff, all hard-working employees and all Gunner fans simply the best! I’m confident our team can complete our mission next season! I loved to be a part of this club. ‘It was a great challenge and experience without a happy end, unfortunately. Thank you very much for your overwhelming support! It was much appreciated!</p>

  <p><b>[Stephan Lichtsteiner says <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> struggled with the top players during his time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I’d say <b>[he is]</b> a good trainer, a good coach, but maybe he struggled with the top players. With the big players, he hasn’t maybe the relationship to bring more out <b>[of them]</b> and get the top performances. Maybe that point I can say <b>[something]</b> negative, but the rest was almost everything positive<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on his own personal experience of working under Emery last season]</b> When a manager doesn’t play you for two months it is easy to criticise. That’s not my style. Over a long time it was really good, then the last two months <b>[of the season]</b> I didn’t really understand what had happened. The training was good, the team that we had last year was an amazing team, so it’s not my thing to speak badly about the coach because it is too easy now to say something against him<br /><br /><b>[It has been suggested that <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> will leave the club in January, but Lichtsteiner still hopes that the midfielder reaches a solution with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I understand both sides, you know? I understand the fans, because there is an ambition and they want to win. They are not happy, of course, but I understand Granit also because this <b>[reaction]</b> is just human. He deserves more respect, because he gives everything for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I see how he works, he is 100 per cent professional. On the other side, the bigger the club is the bigger the pressure. As a football player, you need to manage that pressure because it’s part of the game. It’s normal in football, especially when you are at a big club, this pressure, so it’s completely human what has happened with Granit but I hope for him, and for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, that they are going to find a good solution. It’s important for the team and for him also</p>
