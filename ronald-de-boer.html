  <p><b>[Ronald de Boer is astonished with the progress that Virgil van Dijk]</b> Under Ronald Koeman at Southampton he made unbelievable progress and now this year he is one of the top defenders in the Premier League. He has made the transition in a positive way. When he was at Groningen he did OK, he was physical, but we Dutch always want defenders to play the ball to the same colour and that is something we thought was not his best thing. But now he does that. His passing is excellent but, most importantly, his defending is outstanding. He is showing it week in, week out in one of the toughest leagues in the world.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> favourite Ronald de Boer says legend <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> is mastermind behind Dutch club’s rise back to the big time]</b> We started in 2010, as individual coaches, because Johan wanted more ex- players to be involved in training on a one-on-one basis with the youngsters.<br /><br />We did not do it for the money but because we love <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, standing on the sidelines with young talent and giving something back. I did it for five years. Now I am an <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> ambassador. I worked closely with most of the players you will see in Stockholm like Kenny Tete, <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Davy Klaassen</a>, Joel Veltman, <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>, Jairo Riedewald, <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a>, <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> and others<br /><br />Because of Johan, Frank De Boer got the chance to manage the first team. Johan didn’t like what <a href="martin-jol.html">Martin Jol</a> was doing. He thought the philosophy of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> was gone. He put Frank forward and we started using youth players again<br /><br />When Jol didn’t have a player, he just bought from outside. They went for security. But Johan and also Van Gaal gave youth players a chance. That was <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. When a midfielder is injured, an Under-19s midfielder can fill that spot. That philosophy was fading away. That’s why Johan stepped up and said, ‘This is not my club any more’.<br /><br />It was a great moment for him to step in. That’s why we see so many young players coming through again. That’s definitely the influence of Johan<br /><br />In my time in the 90s, we had five or six players who were exceptional. Now we again have five players who are also exceptional. But the mentality to put players in to get a chance, like a 17-year-old boy, a <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> or a <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, that’s the philosophy you have to have at the club</p>

We were brought up with the philosophy of Ajax and Barcelona so you can expect a similar style of ball possession but creative because football is entertainment of course. But it also has to combine with results. Of course, he knows that this is very important. You will see a team that is well organised and playing as a team.</p>

  <p><b>[Ronald de Boer says that his twin is ‘very excited’ about succeeding <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> in £2.5million-a-year job]</b> He is very excited of course. I know they are talking and I think it’s just about little terms with the coaching staff etc, so I don’t see any problem, but of course it is not for me to say if it is a done deal.<br /><br />It’s the biggest league - everybody knows it, everybody is watching <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You can do really something if you have the chance, because there is money involved and you can buy players. It is an interesting league to see what you are capable of, fitting a team (together) that is good enough for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />Frank has always stood for his football to be attractive, but also he likes teams to be pressing high up and make sure that the ball most of the time stays on the ground, to hopefully have the ball quickly in the possession to try to score. But he knows he will have to get to know the players and what kind of system will fit those players, so it is important he gets a good run, like a six-week pre-season because (after) you can then know the players better</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola will bring special football to Manchester City next season]</b> He will improve ­Manchester City next season, ­without doubt. I say this because he’s the best ­manager. He changes games. He makes teams play. People in the street look at his teams and think, ‘Wow, OK, I want to see this!’. Fans will come to the stadium because they will see something happen. The result may not always be great, but they know the players will be playing ­attractively. They will do everything in their power to win games.<br /><br />They might concede, but the ­supporters will enjoy watching them so much. And, yes, they will do better next season. I know you don’t get that time ­nowadays. Pep knows. You will see, for example, that this new striker Gabriel Jesus is amazing. People will talk for decades about the Barcelona team that Pep had. That is what he can create at City.<br /><br />Barcelona played the most difficult game and were still ­Champions League winners. People say the defence was weak. It wasn’t. They played special football and they were loved for it. And Pep will create this at City</p>

Let’s say we win 1-0 or 2-0, Sweden are playing at home against Luxembourg and I believe they can score four goals at least. That would mean we have to probably beat Sweden 5-0 or 6-0 in Amsterdam <b>[on Tuesday]</b>. Everything is possible. We saw Barcelona do it against PSG, but Barcelona are not the Dutch team</p>

  <p><b>[Ronald de Boer has slammed Crystal Palace for unfairly sacking his brother Frank de Boer]</b> As a brother and if I am objective, I think it is true that he was unfairly treated. If you saw his last games, the level went up. They understood each other better. They wanted to change from ‘kick and rush’ to a passing game. If you hire my brother you know you are going to have a different type of football and it takes time. If you want to go from A to Z, it doesn’t happen overnight. It goes up and down until you reach your goal. The Palace owners should have known this. You can’t get results straight away. It takes time.<br /><br />Against Burnley was probably their best game. They missed so many chances and gave a goal away. And then at the moment you think we are going in the direction we want to go, he is sacked. 77 days? What is this? It is ridiculous.<br /><br />It is sad for Hodgson also. You are going back to where you started. You want to have a change <b>[to passing football]</b> and now you are back to where you began <b>[with direct football]</b>. It is bad management <b>[from the owners]</b><br /><br />He is still hungry to coach a club. He is now being really careful whether the next club fits his profile and if the owner is going to be a stable person</p>

Ajax’s style is the same as Barca’s, they could adapt quickly. I would also advise them to go to Barcelona because the club is in my heart.<br /><br />One million more or less doesn’t matter. The important thing is that they go to a team that fits their style. They have a lot of quality and there are many clubs interested<br /><br />Barca have to renew their team in the coming years because if they don’t they will have problems like Bayern.

When you look at someone like De Ligt, he is already attracting a lot of interest and his departure is pretty much unstoppable. He is such a talent, he can play in any team, in any system, he will go on to have a brilliant career. He is not the only one. For me, there are three or four who could be sold because the amount of money involved, it makes it so hard for Ajax to resist. It is sad this has to happen, but it is football I suppose</p>

He’s so strong, determined to be a winner, unbelievable. You can see it in front of the camera, his interviews, I’ve never seen it from a 19-year-old boy. For me, he can play in every team, if he goes to a defending or attacking team. He’s so good. He can easily come to the Premier League - he can choose any team in the world.<br /><br />Frenkie de Jong went for €75 million and that can go up to €85m at Barcelona. But in my opinion, De Ligt is further in his qualities and is more ready to make that step than Frenkie de Jong. For De Ligt, it’s up to him what he wants to do. He has to look for a team that plays attacking football and has time on the ball. For me <b>[he can go to]</b> Barcelona, Manchester City, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain, these teams I would advise him to go there.

But could anyone have imagined that they would do what they did for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League, or for the national team, so soon? To me, it would have seemed too much to expect. There was always something special about Matthijs and Frenkie.
