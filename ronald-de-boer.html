  <p><b>[Ronald de Boer says <a href="frank-de-boer.html">Frank de Boer</a> can ‘build something’ at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> Frank’s feeling is important, the club’s philosophy is as well - what kind of football they want to play - that will be decisive. He will take his time, to think about it.<br /><br />Frank knows some of the players there, like (Christian) <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> and (Jan) <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Vertonghen</a> - (Nacer) Chadli and (Mousa) Dembele too - there’s lots of quality at the club. I think he can build something. It is a nice club with history, one of the nicest clubs in the Premiership. The club has ambition and the budget for it.<br /><br /><a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, but that’s it. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have let <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished. After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it.</p>

With all due respect for Guus, he’s 67 years old and I think he’s done. He doesn’t show the guys ‘this is the way we want to go’. Of course, he has a great record, but his ideas now are old-fashioned. Guus is more of a people manager who puts an arm around the players when they need him, but these Holland players need guidance</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax favourite Ronald de Boer says legend <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> is mastermind behind Dutch club’s rise back to the big time]</b> We started in 2010, as individual coaches, because Johan wanted more ex- players to be involved in training on a one-on-one basis with the youngsters.<br /><br />We did not do it for the money but because we love <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, standing on the sidelines with young talent and giving something back. I did it for five years. Now I am an <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> ambassador. I worked closely with most of the players you will see in Stockholm like Kenny Tete, <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Davy Klaassen</a>, Joel Veltman, <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>, Jairo Riedewald, <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a>, <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> and others<br /><br />Because of Johan, Frank De Boer got the chance to manage the first team. Johan didn’t like what <a href="martin-jol.html">Martin Jol</a> was doing. He thought the philosophy of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> was gone. He put Frank forward and we started using youth players again<br /><br />When Jol didn’t have a player, he just bought from outside. They went for security. But Johan and also Van Gaal gave youth players a chance. That was <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. When a midfielder is injured, an Under-19s midfielder can fill that spot. That philosophy was fading away. That’s why Johan stepped up and said, ‘This is not my club any more’.<br /><br />It was a great moment for him to step in. That’s why we see so many young players coming through again. That’s definitely the influence of Johan<br /><br />In my time in the 90s, we had five or six players who were exceptional. Now we again have five players who are also exceptional. But the mentality to put players in to get a chance, like a 17-year-old boy, a <a href="justin-kluivert.html">Justin Kluivert</a> or a <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, that’s the philosophy you have to have at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Ronald de Boer says that his twin is ‘very excited’ about succeeding <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> in £2.5million-a-year job]</b> He is very excited of course. I know they are talking and I think it’s just about little terms with the coaching staff etc, so I don’t see any problem, but of course it is not for me to say if it is a done deal.<br /><br />It’s the biggest league - everybody knows it, everybody is watching <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You can do really something if you have the chance, because there is money involved and you can buy players. It is an interesting league to see what you are capable of, fitting a team (together) that is good enough for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />Frank has always stood for his football to be attractive, but also he likes teams to be pressing high up and make sure that the ball most of the time stays on the ground, to hopefully have the ball quickly in the possession to try to score. But he knows he will have to get to know the players and what kind of system will fit those players, so it is important he gets a good run, like a six-week pre-season because (after) you can then know the players better</p>

He started at Ajax as a 10-year-old and he has a philosophy and a way of playing which is very close to that of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> He wouldn’t need to adapt, and he would be ready to play. People see him with a ball, but without the ball he is also very good. <b>[PSG]</b> are a very good team with great players, but they are a team that don’t play like <b>[De Ligt]</b> is used to. It’s different and philosophy is important, and if you ask me I’d prefer to see him at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He must have confidence in his own character. If he doesn’t play the first few months <b>[at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b>, he should remain calm. De Ligt has this character as he’s patient and he’s going to be a great signing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, if it’s finally done.<br /><br /><b>[De Boer is expecting the 22-year-old to thrive with the Blaugrana, but can understand when fellow Dutchman <a href="jasper-cillessen.html">Jasper Cillessen</a> is looking for a way out of Camp Nou amid struggles for regular game time]</b> <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> is a very talented player and he’s had a spectacular year. His potential is great and his style is close to that of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, so I think he’s going to be successful. Sometimes you have to see who is in front of you and <b>[<a href="jasper-cillessen.html">Cillessen</a>]</b> has <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> who is an impressive goalkeeper. <b>[<a href="jasper-cillessen.html">Cillessen</a>]</b> is also a great goalkeeper and he wants to play in the important games.

  <p><b>[Ajax legend Ronald de Boer was taken aback by the performances of <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> and <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> in the Champions League last season]</b> Was I surprised by just how good they were? Honestly, yes. But I think the boys surprised even themselves. I had high hopes for them because it was obvious that they had real talent, and the right mentality too. But could anyone have imagined that they would do what they did for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League, or for the national team, so soon? To me, it would have seemed too much to expect. There was always something special about Matthijs and Frenkie. With Matthijs, you could see even at 17, when he was already playing in the second team, how mature he was. As for Frenkie, he was part of a midfield in Ajax’s second team with <a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">Donny van de Beek</a> and <a href="abdelhak-nouri.html">Abdelhak Nouri</a>. People would come to watch that team just to see that midfield play. You actually had people at that stage saying they enjoyed watching the second team more than the first team! The level of creativity was just incredible, and Frenkie of course was at the heart of it<br /><br />I have no worries about De Ligt. For me, he’s a player who can play in any team and in any system. He’s still young and he’ll make mistakes, but he has so many qualities. Even if he starts a little slowly - and it was the same at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in his first few months - he will be a great signing for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. You can bet on it</p>

It would have been easier to adapt. I thought he would have made a different choice, but I respect the decision very much. I was working in the academy of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, I immediately liked his character: serious, intelligent, kind, he never complains, he works hard and learns. And then he always had the skills of the great defender. He understood where the danger was coming… I remember him at under-14 level, when he returned from the following year 30 centimetres taller. He will be one of the best of this era, sure</p>
