  <p><b>[Arsenal face competition from Barcelona in the battle to sign CSKA Moscow midfielder Aleksandr Golovin, according to Russian agent Sandor Varga]</b> Why not? I see great potential in him. This summer, I watched Aleksandr a lot at the request of Arsene Wenger. Once such clubs follow the player, it means there’s something there. Their scouting services don’t just watch them for fun.<br /><br />It all depends on the manager. I have full faith in Wenger. If Aleksandr gets to play under him, he’ll be very lucky</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandr Golovin’s father hints at Arsenal move as Russia star shines in World Cup shop window]</b> Sasha <b>[Russian variation on Aleksandr]</b> does not even read this news so as not to clog his head during the World Cup. He now has one thing on his mind: the Russian team. But if such proposals are made, I believe that he will go abroad, play abroad. There football is of a different level, there is nowhere to hide. Speeds are different. I’m sure my son will be able to play at a new level. It will be more difficult with a foreign language. But I know that Sasha has already started learning English</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandr Golovin is in talks to join Chelsea, though such a move will not be completed until after the World Cup according to the Russia star’s mother]</b> Yes, now there are talks between the clubs, but we still do not know the details. Sacha right now stands only for the Russian team, fully focused on the World Cup. The transition from one club to another will only be discussed after it is completed here. For now, everyone loves my Sacha, even those who before didn’t care about football. His biggest fan is his 83-year-old grandmother - she does not miss a single match.</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandr Golovin completes €30m move to Monaco from CSKA Moscow]</b> I am very happy to sign for AS Monaco. This is a new adventure for me that I approach with a lot of ambitions. I am now very much looking forward to meeting the staff and my new teammates and to get going.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco midfielder Aleksandr Golovin says former manager Thierry Henry did not fully transition into the role of a manager]</b> Maybe Henry didn’t kill the role of the player inside of him. When things weren’t working out during practice he would get nervous and yell a lot. Maybe it was unnecessary. He was a very strong player and the only players near his level at Monaco are maybe <b>[Radamel]</b> Falcao and <b>[Cesc]</b> Fabregas. He would try to go out onto the field and show us how to practice and yell.<br /><br />Maybe a different manager would say ‘let’s go, get it together’, but he would get nervous right away and run onto the field and start playing and showing us things. He would scream ‘try to get the ball away from me’. Players were mostly calm, but maybe they were in a bit of a shock. You could tell he didn’t fully transition into the role of manager. There were times when he would feel hurt and not talk to us and review tactics for hours<br /><br />After Jardim came back, positivity during training came back. It’s much harder being the main coach rather than the fun assistant manager when you realise everything is on your shoulders. He wanted to advance the youth at the club and brought up 6 players to train with the main team. He trusted young players and I liked that</p>

The first games were really tough. <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> players are stronger physically, faster and more technical than in Russia.<br /><br /><b>[Aleksandr Golovin on <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>]</b> He’s not completed his transition to a coaching role … For me, he’s not ready to coach yet</p>
