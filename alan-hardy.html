  <p>[Notts County manager Kevin Nolan has registered himself as a player as the club bids to avoid relegation from League Two] It was always Kevin’s intention to register as a player and I’m delighted to confirm we have now completed the formalities. He will of course need to continue building his fitness but, when he’s ready, I’m confident we will have one of, if not the, best midfielders in the league.</p>

  <p>[Harry Kewell leaves Crawley Town for Notts County] Having now worked in football for a significant period of time, I have had the opportunity to learn from other clubs what good looks like. I have therefore decided to appoint a technical director, who will set the club’s overall footballing philosophy and be on hand to support and mentor the manager as required. Harry will, however, be solely responsible for our first-team squad, having the final say on transfers, tactics and team selection. He has enjoyed an excellent start to his managerial career and I am hugely impressed with his knowledge and attention to detail. I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions about the role and have been left with no doubt that he has a fierce ambition to succeed and a real enthusiasm to work for Notts County.</p>

  <p>[Harry Kewell has been dismissed by Notts County less than three months after he was appointed the club’s manager] Harry’s passion and commitment as a coach is unquestionable. I enjoyed seeing first hand his love for the job and it gives me absolutely no pleasure to take that away from him. Unfortunately, however, things quite simply were not working out for him here at Meadow Lane. Results have not been good enough and performance levels are a continuing concern. We see no reason to continue with something we don’t think can work. Harry leaves with our best wishes for the future and our search for a new manager begins immediately.<br /><br />We hope to make an appointment before Saturday’s Sky Bet League Two match at home to Cheltenham Town</p>
