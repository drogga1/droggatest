<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On his journey]</b> I came to Zilina in order to play senior football. In Gyor, I had played only one game for first team. In Zilina, I was getting opportunities regularly. The essential thing for any player is to work really hard every day and to give his best to improve. I consider it to be only another test for me. I cannot get satisfied with what I have already achieved. I have to continue like this. I will do everything I need to move to a higher level<br /><br />I could have played in the summer friendly matches for Monchengladbach, but as I got injured, I got only 45 minutes. I was injured for six weeks and, during the autumn, I started only for the Under-23 team. I was in similar situation after I arrived in Zilina<br /><br /><b>[Monchengladbach’s coach Dieter Hecking gave him a chance off the bench in the Bundesliga clash with the mighty Bayern Munich]</b> The night before the game, I was not even able to sleep. It was my dream to play against Bayern. My dad was crying a little but that’s a normal thing, in my opinion!<br /><br /><b>[For the moment, he is thinking only of his country and openly admits]</b> In the future, I would love to play alongside Marek Hamsik in Slovakia’s midfield</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal were among Monchengladbach’s opponents in the battle for Laszlo Benes’ signature but his agent Karol Csonto felt that his client would be better served by a move to Germany]</b> Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Monchengladbach were the only two clubs we would allow him to join. Currently, I would not let him go to England. Arsenal were interested in him, too, but we had to be realistic about first-team chances.</p>
