  <p><b>[Franck Kessie angered Gasperini in a 2-1 win over Torino by taking the ball off designated penalty taker Alberto Paloschi when Atalanta were awarded a penalty with eight minutes to go. Kessie converted the spot-kick but that was not the point]</b> He should not have taken it. There’s a designated list and it should have been Paloschi or <b>[Alejandro]</b> Gomez. He put himself in the middle of something he had no right to be in even as his team-mates were warning him not to get involved. Such things are not right. In the big teams, it doesn’t work like this. If he wants to become a great player, he must grow also in this regard.</p>

  <p><b>[Gasperini is just as awestruck by his players’ resilience]</b> This team is extraordinary in terms of mentality. The rest comes later, tactically, physically, but the psychological level is so important. I see every fear and doubt disappear in that dressing room and we focus entirely on winning the game.<br /><br />I gained a spare man that I could commit to tactical manoeuvres. It was worth the risk. The Atalanta defenders you see attacking constantly today were born from that intuition<br /><br /><b>[Gasperini insists he’s not surprised that Atalanta have also upset many far richer rivals this season]</b> Economic considerations are one thing, but sport is another. I firmly believe you are more likely to get good results if you play good football</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta boss Gian Piero Gasperini vented his frustrations at officials following his side’s 2-0 loss to Lazio in the Coppa Italia final]</b> This is very serious. That was going into the goal, it was clearly deflected. I didn’t like Banti throughout the game, but this incident is absolutely worthy of a VAR review. This completely changes everything that had been done during the season in Serie A. It is very serious. It’s unjustifiable. It is unacceptable. We accept the defeat, Lazio are a very good team, it was a balanced game, but no this incident is absolutely unacceptable. I wasn’t angry before I saw that replay, as from the bench I absolutely didn’t see that. My players told me there was a hand, but I thought it was one of those handballs that saw some absurd penalties given during the season, but this was far worse. It’s very clear.<br /><br />Maybe we wouldn’t have won anyway, but it’s really ugly to see this. It’s ugly. This was a very balanced game decided late on and a penalty, not to mention Bastos was already on a yellow card before that, it changes the game. We played this Coppa Final with 21,000 fans following us. It shows no respect at all for the Atalanta supporters. We saw all season that penalties were given for absurd touches, but this is far worse than many that were awarded. If there hadn’t been VAR, then that’s understandable, but no, this is unjustifiable<br /><br />It is a shocking incident and shameful to do this to Atalanta. This takes away credibility from VAR. It’s also a bad sign for Italian football. It’s incomprehensible, as of course the same clubs keep winning. Are we meant to only use VAR when it’s handy? It was a penalty and a red card. This is a scandal! Tell me why it happened? Give me some justification, if you can? It might not have been seen by the referee, and indeed I didn’t see it either, but the VAR? I want those officials in the booth to come here and explain to me what they saw! The only possible explanation is they had a blackout and couldn’t see the screen. Either that or they just closed their eyes and looked the other way. It changes the game! It would’ve been 11 against 10 just 25 minutes in with a penalty … You’re taking 21,000 people for a ride. You’re making fun of them!</p>

He cooked a great risotto. Today, Paolo is a great friend. From risotto to risotto, we’re in the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Atalanta had dominated Copenhagen over two legs but were eliminated 4-3 in a penalty shootout at Parken on August 30.

  <p><b>[Atalanta defeated Udinese 7-1 on Sunday to equal their biggest ever <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> victory.

After nine rounds, this all just confirms it is a very difficult season for everyone at both ends of the table. We’re trying to use the Champions League to gain experience and it helps us become better in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> too. We make mistakes every now and then, but we have also been scoring regularly for 18 months and it really helps us to fight back from difficult situations, as for example we went behind today. If we made no mistakes at the back and kept scoring like this, then we would be even higher up the table</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini on VAR]</b> In my view, the technology has totally failed. The objective was to provide justice in incidents of clear and obvious error, but instead it is doing the contrary. VAR ended up creating even bigger doubts. When you are faced with footage that is so obvious and still make a mistake, that turns into a very dangerous boomerang</p>

Football is not just an economic endeavour, of course, as I am the first to highlight the importance of tactics and playing style, but the size of a club does count. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> had a fairy tale, but they were able to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because that season (in 2015-16) all the big clubs had an off year.

It must be remembered that this game was held behind closed doors, amidst strict measures in this regard, on the orders of the Spanish health authorities to prevent the risk of contagion by Covid-19, precisely due to the presence of persons from an area already publicly classified as ‘at risk’ at that time</p>

  <p><b>[Gasperini didn’t test positive for coronavirus before the match in March, his symptoms were extreme and had the Italian concerned for his own health]</b> I was scared. The day before the game I was sick, the afternoon of the game worse. The two nights after I slept little. If you look at the pictures, I did not look good on the bench. That was March 10. The two nights afterwards, I did not sleep well. I didn’t have a fever, but I felt like I did. Every two minutes, an ambulance would go past, as there’s a hospital near the training ground. It sounded like a warzone. At night I would think: ‘What will happen to me if I go into that hospital? I can’t go now, I have so much still to do’. It was in a way a joke with myself to lighten the mood, but on the other hand, I really did think about that</p>

I felt strong, wonderful<br /><br /><b>[Gasperini said he also lost his sense of taste, a common symptom of coronavirus]</b> The day after, the team received food and 2008 Dom Perignon from a Michelin-star chef who is a fan of Atalanta. I tasted it and said: ‘This is water … ‘ The food tasted like bread. I had completely lost my sense of taste.<br /><br />Ten days ago serological tests confirmed that I had Covid-19. I have the antibodies. It doesn’t mean that they are now immune.<br /><br />It’ll take time before we can see the joyful scenes in the square or at the airport again, but the people of Bergamo are the burning embers under the ash. They will slowly emerge again. This team remained connected to the suffering of Bergamo, none of the players left the city during the lockdown, and they will represent Bergamo on the pitch. There is this deep, dignified sadness in the city. The air is thick with it, you feel it everywhere, in the street, in people’s eyes, in the shuttered bars and restaurants, in the silence of my staff member who lost his father. It’ll take years to truly understand what happened, because this was the centre of the tragedy. Every time I think about it, this feels so absurd: the peak of sporting joy coincided with the depths of despair for Bergamo</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta coach hits back over coronavirus controversy]</b> It is a very offensive controversy. I know I respected the protocols, I was in quarantine like everyone else. I did not do a swab test but in May when we did serological tests I discovered that I had contracted the virus. I had aches and pains, but I never had a fever or lung problems of any kind. When I left Bergamo I was fine, I had some problems in the evening and the next day. But the controversy is offensive and ugly. Atalanta owner Antonio Percassi has given his backing to Gasperini, insisting the club followed the rules and are moving forward. I am with Gasperini and the players. I am looking ahead. The controls say that, like Atalanta with our members, we did everything in compliance with the rules and with the utmost prudence. This is fundamental for us. We are in Bergamo.<br /><br />I was scared. The day before the game I was sick, the afternoon of the game worse. The two nights after I slept little.
