They’re all really positive guys<br /><br /><b>[Gasperini admitted that for the majority of his coaching career he had been too dogmatic in his approach]</b> Just because you’re humble, doesn’t mean you can’t be ambitious. I firmly believe you are more likely to get good results if you play good football<br /><br /><b>[To place above Inter and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> was a staggering achievement for a club with just the 13th-highest wage bill in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, making them arguably the biggest over-achievers in Europe]</b> It’s undeniable that securing Champions League qualification with a provincial club is even more satisfying. <br /><br /><b>[Gasperini and his players are now determined to repay that love by lighting up the Champions League]</b> We want to give the people of Bergamo enthusiasm and joy because throughout this whole story. the thing that moved us the most was seeing happiness in the eyes of the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta defeated Udinese 7-1 on Sunday to equal their biggest ever <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> victory. When asked if Atalanta could challenge for the Scudetto]</b> No. Only <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> can lose it, but then there are Inter and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, as well as the other so-called big clubs like Roma and Milan, who are perhaps considered big more for what they represent than their current results. After nine rounds, this all just confirms it is a very difficult season for everyone at both ends of the table. We’re trying to use the Champions League to gain experience and it helps us become better in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> too. We make mistakes every now and then, but we have also been scoring regularly for 18 months and it really helps us to fight back from difficult situations, as for example we went behind today. If we made no mistakes at the back and kept scoring like this, then we would be even higher up the table</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini on VAR]</b> In my view, the technology has totally failed. The objective was to provide justice in incidents of clear and obvious error, but instead it is doing the contrary. VAR ended up creating even bigger doubts. When you are faced with footage that is so obvious and still make a mistake, that turns into a very dangerous boomerang</p>

  <p><b>[Gasperini on ambition]</b> Just because you’re humble, doesn’t mean you can’t be ambitious. I firmly believe you are more likely to get good results if you play good football. Football is not just an economic endeavour, of course, as I am the first to highlight the importance of tactics and playing style, but the size of a club does count. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> had a fairy tale, but they were able to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because that season (in 2015-16) all the big clubs had an off year.

We know that many people followed us at home, who cannot go out to celebrate. But we will have time to do it in June at the end of the championship. We will have a big party for everything, also for this danger that we will defeat</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia slam Atalanta coach <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gasperini</a> for attending Champions League game with coronavirus]</b> Given the statements by Atalanta coach <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gian Piero Gasperini</a>, which appeared in the Italian press this Sunday, <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> CF wishes to publicly express its surprise at the fact that the coach of the opposing team in our <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League quarter-final tie recognises that, both the day before and the day of the match played on March 10 in <a href="valencia-fc.html">Mestalla</a> he was aware of, at least himself, suffering from symptoms theoretically compatible with those of coronavirus without taking preventive measures, putting at risk, if that had been the case, numerous people during their trip to and stay in <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>. It must be remembered that this game was held behind closed doors, amidst strict measures in this regard, on the orders of the Spanish health authorities to prevent the risk of contagion by Covid-19, precisely due to the presence of persons from an area already publicly classified as ‘at risk’ at that time</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta coach hits back over coronavirus controversy]</b> It is a very offensive controversy. I know I respected the protocols, I was in quarantine like everyone else. I did not do a swab test but in May when we did serological tests I discovered that I had contracted the virus. I had aches and pains, but I never had a fever or lung problems of any kind. When I left Bergamo I was fine, I had some problems in the evening and the next day. But the controversy is offensive and ugly. Atalanta owner Antonio Percassi has given his backing to Gasperini, insisting the club followed the rules and are moving forward. I am with Gasperini and the players. I am looking ahead. The controls say that, like Atalanta with our members, we did everything in compliance with the rules and with the utmost prudence. This is fundamental for us. We are in Bergamo.<br /><br />I was scared. The day before the game I was sick, the afternoon of the game worse. The two nights after I slept little. If you look at the pictures, I did not look good on the bench. That was March 10. The two nights afterwards, I did not sleep well. I didn’t have a fever, but I felt like I did. Every two minutes, an ambulance would go past, as there’s a hospital near the training ground. It sounded like a war zone. At night I would think: ‘What will happen to me if I go into that hospital? I can’t go now, I have so much still to do’. It was in a way a joke with myself to lighten the mood, but on the other hand, I really did think about that</p>

  <p><b>[Atalanta coach Gasperini reveals he had Covid-19 during <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> game and feared for his life]</b> I was scared.

The two nights afterwards, I did not sleep well. I didn’t have a fever, but I felt like I did. Every two minutes, an ambulance would go past, as there’s a hospital near the training ground.

It was in a way a joke with myself to lighten the mood, but on the other hand, I really did think about that. Then, on Saturday March 14, I had the toughest training session in years, an hour on the running machine, plus a 10km run. I felt strong, wonderful<br /><br /><b>[Gasperini said he also lost his sense of taste, a common symptom of coronavirus]</b> The day after, the team received food and 2008 Dom Perignon from a Michelin-star chef who is a fan of Atalanta. I tasted it and said: ‘This is water … ‘ The food tasted like bread. I had completely lost my sense of taste.<br /><br />Ten days ago serological tests confirmed that I had Covid-19. I have the antibodies. It doesn’t mean that they are now immune.<br /><br />It’ll take time before we can see the joyful scenes in the square or at the airport again, but the people of Bergamo are the burning embers under the ash. They will slowly emerge again. This team remained connected to the suffering of Bergamo, none of the players left the city during the lockdown, and they will represent Bergamo on the pitch. There is this deep, dignified sadness in the city. The air is thick with it, you feel it everywhere, in the street, in people’s eyes, in the shuttered bars and restaurants, in the silence of my staff member who lost his father. It’ll take years to truly understand what happened, because this was the centre of the tragedy. Every time I think about it, this feels so absurd: the peak of sporting joy coincided with the depths of despair for Bergamo</p>
