<blockquote>
  <p>[Saint-Etienne striker Nolan Roux has rubbished the reports of a parody site linking him with Baywatch star Pamela Anderson] I do not know what guy pulled out that, but congratulations to him. I do not see how we can get things out like this! So yes, it’s funny for a minute because parody sites do not know what to write. But I wonder how the reporter could believe it and not take it back! Pamela Anderson in Saint-Etienne? It would be a little weird.<br /><br />What bothers me is that it affects personal life. I think no one believes in it, and so much the better. This story reminds me of an article that Benoit Assou-Ekotto stopped football to get into porn. That was also a lack of respect<br /><br />[Asked what his wife had made of the story] She also laughed. But it is always a bit annoying to receive text messages from people who wonder how it is possible. Our friends and family do not believe it, fortunately! My friends laugh even. I sent the picture to my mother, she told me they did not know what to invent</p>
