<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On why he choose Canada]</b> In the Czech Republic you’ve got 90-95 percent of the boys in one country, domestic, and it’s kind of everybody knows everybody well. That group that we had in Toulon, it just kind of sums up Canada. There are so many backgrounds where people are playing and the diversity in the group from some boys playing first-team level in various European leagues, some people coming through the academy. This group just kind of formed and it really clicked and a lot of it was down to the new leadership coming through. The new manager, John Herdman, his main focus was kind of bringing the group together because he knew that could be the biggest weakness if we didn’t have that happen. Because we kind of really targeted that and really tried to get the group to jell..<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be in the first men’s national team camp that he had and also Toulon and it was nailed on, exactly the same. The approach was just mirrored between the two. You’ve got his philosophy of breaking it down into four stages of the game and just getting a way that we play rather than always adjusting to the opposition. If you can bring that into the 23s or the 20s, it was a young group there were even 17-year-olds. If you can get the 17-year-olds to the 23s really following the way the men’s group is going to play, then for years to come you’re going to have success</p>
