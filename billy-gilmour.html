  <p><b>[Meet Billy Gilmour: The latest Chelsea academy star making a name for himself]</b> When I see Ethan and Callum Hudson-Odoi get their chance with Chelsea’s first team it gives me hope because we’re a similar age. So, I’ll just continue to work really hard and try to do that as well. Since Ethan has been involved with the first team he has done really well and kept his standards high. You just have to work so hard to get there. I’ve been playing well for the Under-23s at Chelsea and hopefully that will continue. It’s different for me. At Under-18s last year, I was dominating games but it’s not as easy now. Most of the boys I’m playing against are older and more experienced and because we’ve so many away out on loan, we have a young team. But I want to make an impact at that level for the full campaign. That’s my aim and then we’ll see what happens next season</p>

  <p><b>[Billy Gilmour starred for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on his full debut against Grimsby]</b> I’m Scottish! No, I’m not shy. On the pitch it’s football. If you’re not going to talk, what are you doing on the pitch? You need to communicate. I love football, a big part of my game is communicating. I’m just taking it a step at a time. I’ve got the 23s, we’re doing really well there. Of course, I want to get as many opportunities with the first team as possible. I just need to keep training hard and working hard<br /><br />It was a really good feeling to make my full debut, and it was really good to get the win. It was breathtaking. It was a great night to walk out in front of all the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans. And the boys performed really well. You could see the attacking threat we had with the goals. The gaffer has come in and wants to play the youth. It’s been a really good experience for us and we’re gaining confidence from it. I have worked hard for this so it wasn’t a shock, but I had to step up and show what I’m capable of. I think I played well</p>

  <p><b>[Billy Gilmour has revealed that he was considering pushing for a loan move away from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> stepped in]</b> In pre-season, the manager had a chat with me saying he knew I wanted to go on loan but said it would be better if I stayed. Obviously it’s working. He’s looking at younger players. With the transfer ban it’s hard but it’s good experience for us. Hopefully, I can try to get more first-team games. He talks to you normally, tells you you’re doing well and says if I want to keep training with them I need to keep my standards up. I wanted to follow my dream and to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and choosing <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has turned out to be the right move. I’m enjoying it. The plan for me was set up and I’m now ahead of the plan<br /><br /><b>[Gilmour admits he is surprised to have earned senior outings so soon]</b> I thought I was going to play two years at Under-18s but I played one at 18s and then moved on to the Under-23s. This year should be my first year at 23s but I’m one of the senior players. I am training with the first team and I have had a couple of games so I’m in a good position now</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youngster Billy Gilmour has revealed that he idolised <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> pair <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> when he was growing up]</b> If you are small, it doesn’t matter. Some of the best players in the world are small like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. When I get on the ball I move it quickly so I am two steps ahead. It was always El Clasico that I loved to watch when I was young. I loved watching <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>. They were my favourite players. You can put <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> up there but <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> was more like my style of play.<br /><br />Looking at <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, that’s what I wanted to focus my game on. Then in the academy, you are asked to compare your game to other players so I looked to <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a> when he was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is a top player, how he got on the ball, received it and passed it. So I was looking at that and then right now there’s a lot of players to look at. When I watch games now I like to see <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a>, Luka <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a>, <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a> and Jorginho<br /><br />They are top players to look at because I like to get on the ball, drop deep, create play and I am always hardworking and on the move searching for space. I like to give out a few tackles too, though I might be small. I think I am also a bit of a leader on the pitch too. I am always talking and in the game<br /><br />I grew up with Rangers since I was young. I made a lot of friends and knew all the coaches so it was hard but it was time for a change. I wanted to fulfil a dream in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is the best league in the world. When you watch the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> and <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a> - we have all the best players here so that’s why I wanted to come here to test myself. Joining <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has been the right decision with everything that was there for me.<br /><br />The first season showed that when we won the quadruple so it was a great season. You can’t beat that really can you? In the squad now you learn a lot about your game with the team. Especially <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>, being the leader that he is but they are all good at talking to you and helping you out. It is exciting. The experience I am gaining is massive. When I came, it was <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> in the Under-18s and Joe Edwards in the Under-23s so when you go around there you can feel a bit more relaxed because you know Joe and Jody. Then <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> comes in - it is really good.<br /><br />He is doing really well. It is a real bonus he came back. There is a real togetherness when a lot of young players come over in training. Just being around the top players we have there, especially with the gaffer putting a lot of trust in the young ones. You can see it has shown as we are in good form right now. It has been a good season. I definitely learned the most from that game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the cup. It was tough, you learn you have got to move the ball quickly, not to take many touches on the ball, think of your next pass and be two steps ahead of the defender. Against top midfielders, top players. I learned a lot from that opportunity. I have played a lot of games across all levels. The Under-23s are top of the league by four points and then any more chances I can get in the first team will be really good</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ross-barkley.html">Barkley</a>’s 18-year-old team-mate Gilmour earned headlines for his display and the England midfielder was not surprised to see the Scot performing so well despite his lack of experience]</b> It doesn’t surprise me. I see him doing it in training every day. He doesn’t have a day when he is struggling. For a young lad, he is really mature with his ability on the ball, he makes the right decision most of the time.<br /><br />He is similar to <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>. He is a quality player and a good addition to the squad. He recently moved into the first-team changing room with us and he’s settled in really well and long may it continue.<br /><br />He is always asking questions as well which is a sign of a player that wants to improve and do well for the club. I like him and the manager and coaching staff love him as well</p>

I was gutted at myself just because of the score<br /><br />The gaffer texted me later saying ‘these are the moments I want you to remember. When you’re training hard, that’s what you need to bring into the games when people aren’t playing well. You need to take the good and the bad together’<br /><br />It was a tough game. <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> worked really hard.

They wanted to take pictures afterwards but I wasn’t really smiling because I was in a bad mood!<br /><br /><b>[The Scottish starlet went on to express his gratitude towards <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> One of the best things that’s happened this season has been training with the first team because it means I have to keep my standards high and train hard every day. Then when I go down to my own age group with the development squad, I’m continuing to keep the standards high and take that into games - we’re still unbeaten, top of the league and we’ve done so well.<br /><br />I felt I did well in pre-season but I did think when we came back that I’d be going on loan. The gaffer and Jody <b>[Morris, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> assistant manager]</b> spoke to me and said they thought it was best for me to stay, play games with the Under-23s and train with the first team a lot more.<br /><br />I was happy with that, especially the chance to get more opportunities to train with the first team and express myself and show them what I’m about. At Christmas time, I was thinking I might go out on loan for the rest of the season but got told to stay again and got moved into the first-team building. That’s when I started to kick on from there by playing games consecutively and playing well so it’s worked out really well for me. All I can do is thank the manager for trusting in me.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> thrashed QPR 7-1 in a friendly match on Sunday, with midfielders <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a> and Billy Gilmour each scoring twice]</b> When I was real young I used to watch <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, as everyone did, but when I started analysing my game more and seeing who I would progress and hope to be like, it was more like <b>[Andres]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, <b>[Cesc]</b> <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Fabregas</a>, all them type of players. It was just something I loved watching, seeing how they pass the ball, receive the ball and everything was sharp. <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> as well, when you watch <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, you watch <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> individually and everything happens around him. But when you watch <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, you don’t really see <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>. But that’s the kind of player I’ve always looked up to and just wanted to be that kind of player to get on the ball and make things happen</p>

  <p><b>[Billy Gilmour: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder set to miss rest of season with knee injury]</b> I just have to stay focused on when the teams need me. There have been rumours but I haven’t heard anything; I am just focusing on finishing the season well with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and qualifying for the Champions League</p>
