  <p><b>[Motivation isn’t a problem at Melbourne Victory, with coach Kevin Muscat claiming his players are so thirsty for improvement]</b> The things that are driven from the playing group themselves bear the most weight. It’s as simple as that. We’re travelling along very well at the moment in terms of the way we’re playing. There are players who are not in the team, who believe they should be in the team and it’s pretty simple - you’re history’s not going to get you back into the team. Being consistently better than the person who’s playing in your position is going to get you back into the team, so if you’re not thirsty and you’re not hungry for that it’s not going to happen. Everyone will get an opportunity, everyone will be required at some point. It’s <b>[about]</b> making sure you’re prepared and ready for when that does happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Geria]</b> I think he’s <b>[Geria]</b> made a good solid decision that he wants to be the best player in his position in this country and in this competition, and then, you know what, once he does get to that he won’t be asking to get into the national team or people won’t be pushing his <b>[case]</b>, he’ll be selected. I think we’re fortunate that he’s committed his future to the football club</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat has claimed Brisbane Roar defender Luke DeVere told him Besart Berisha shouldn’t have been sent off]</b> Bes is really unlucky. I haven’t come across anyone that says it’s a red card. Luke DeVere comes up to me after the game and was embarrassed because he said ‘I wasn’t making a meal of it. It was accidental. I told the referee that.’ They were his words, not mine. Subsequently I’ve seen it. The ball’s coming up to him <b>[Berisha]</b>, he puts his arms out and he doesn’t even know where Luke DeVere is but the decision’s been made. We move on.<br /><br /><b>[Many Victory fans must be expecting their club will appeal Berisha’s sanction]</b> As far as I know there are no grounds to appeal.<br /><br />That first 27 minutes we played some great football and they were on the back foot. Let’s call a spade a spade. They were on the back foot, we were dominating with presence, with a clear intent to attack. Through our own fault, we got Brisbane back into the game</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC know Melbourne Victory can beat them]</b> If we put every brick in place, we’ll beat them. If we prepare well, which we have, if we turn up, if we deliver our best is good enough to beat them. We know that and they know it also. If we start worrying and concentrating on that I dare say we’ll miss the detail and detail in the last two games has cost us points<br /><br />I don’t really get sentimental … but this one particularly, I felt the need to remind the players and congratulate him <b>[Broxham]</b> in front of his peers because he’s stood the test of time. He’s really had to earn every one of those games. He’s someone who really epitomises what it’s all about at this football club - working hard, getting your head down, being humble, being respectful</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Kevin Muscat blamed poor decision-making for Melbourne Victory’s loss to Sydney FC]</b> It’s our own doing if we were. I’m not walking away from tonight terrified whatsoever. I will never give up trying to catch <b>[Sydney]</b>. We haven’t been opened up tonight. We haven’t been out-passed or outplayed. I was really happy with the football we played.<br /><br />We scored a very, very good goal but it’s disappointing at the moment that we’re making some decisions defensively that are resulting in goals<br /><br />We’re going to have eliminate these errors that result in goals because they’re soft. Maybe we could be slightly fresher but it didn’t affect the outcome of the game</p>

  <p><b>[While unable to inspire Victory to success on the pitch, departing coach Kevin Muscat is adamant Honda had a significant overall influence]</b> <a href="keisuke-honda.html">Keisuke Honda</a>’s had a huge impact on the football club, his peers, the younger players and myself without a doubt. Listening to Keisuke’s answers, he’s a winner and his frame of mind is always positive. He’s applied himself in the right manner at every opportunity</p>
