  <p><b>[Motivation isn’t a problem at Melbourne Victory, with coach Kevin Muscat claiming his players are so thirsty for improvement]</b> The things that are driven from the playing group themselves bear the most weight. It’s as simple as that. We’re travelling along very well at the moment in terms of the way we’re playing. There are players who are not in the team, who believe they should be in the team and it’s pretty simple - you’re history’s not going to get you back into the team. Being consistently better than the person who’s playing in your position is going to get you back into the team, so if you’re not thirsty and you’re not hungry for that it’s not going to happen. Everyone will get an opportunity, everyone will be required at some point. It’s <b>[about]</b> making sure you’re prepared and ready for when that does happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Geria]</b> I think he’s <b>[Geria]</b> made a good solid decision that he wants to be the best player in his position in this country and in this competition, and then, you know what, once he does get to that he won’t be asking to get into the national team or people won’t be pushing his <b>[case]</b>, he’ll be selected. I think we’re fortunate that he’s committed his future to the football club</p>

  <p><b>[While unable to inspire Victory to success on the pitch, departing coach Kevin Muscat is adamant Honda had a significant overall influence]</b> <a href="keisuke-honda.html">Keisuke Honda</a>’s had a huge impact on the football club, his peers, the younger players and myself without a doubt. Listening to Keisuke’s answers, he’s a winner and his frame of mind is always positive. He’s applied himself in the right manner at every opportunity</p>
