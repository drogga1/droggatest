  <p><b>[Motivation isn’t a problem at Melbourne Victory, with coach Kevin Muscat claiming his players are so thirsty for improvement]</b> The things that are driven from the playing group themselves bear the most weight. It’s as simple as that. We’re travelling along very well at the moment in terms of the way we’re playing. There are players who are not in the team, who believe they should be in the team and it’s pretty simple - you’re history’s not going to get you back into the team. Being consistently better than the person who’s playing in your position is going to get you back into the team, so if you’re not thirsty and you’re not hungry for that it’s not going to happen. Everyone will get an opportunity, everyone will be required at some point. It’s <b>[about]</b> making sure you’re prepared and ready for when that does happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Geria]</b> I think he’s <b>[Geria]</b> made a good solid decision that he wants to be the best player in his position in this country and in this competition, and then, you know what, once he does get to that he won’t be asking to get into the national team or people won’t be pushing his <b>[case]</b>, he’ll be selected. I think we’re fortunate that he’s committed his future to the football club</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat has claimed Brisbane Roar defender Luke DeVere told him Besart Berisha shouldn’t have been sent off]</b> Bes is really unlucky. I haven’t come across anyone that says it’s a red card. Luke DeVere comes up to me after the game and was embarrassed because he said ‘I wasn’t making a meal of it. It was accidental. I told the referee that.’ They were his words, not mine. Subsequently I’ve seen it. The ball’s coming up to him <b>[Berisha]</b>, he puts his arms out and he doesn’t even know where Luke DeVere is but the decision’s been made. We move on.<br /><br /><b>[Many Victory fans must be expecting their club will appeal Berisha’s sanction]</b> As far as I know there are no grounds to appeal.<br /><br />That first 27 minutes we played some great football and they were on the back foot. Let’s call a spade a spade. They were on the back foot, we were dominating with presence, with a clear intent to attack. Through our own fault, we got Brisbane back into the game</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC know Melbourne Victory can beat them]</b> If we put every brick in place, we’ll beat them. If we prepare well, which we have, if we turn up, if we deliver our best is good enough to beat them. We know that and they know it also. If we start worrying and concentrating on that I dare say we’ll miss the detail and detail in the last two games has cost us points<br /><br />I don’t really get sentimental … but this one particularly, I felt the need to remind the players and congratulate him <b>[Broxham]</b> in front of his peers because he’s stood the test of time. He’s really had to earn every one of those games. He’s someone who really epitomises what it’s all about at this football club - working hard, getting your head down, being humble, being respectful</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Kevin Muscat blamed poor decision-making for Melbourne Victory’s loss to Sydney FC]</b> It’s our own doing if we were. I’m not walking away from tonight terrified whatsoever. I will never give up trying to catch <b>[Sydney]</b>. We haven’t been opened up tonight. We haven’t been out-passed or outplayed. I was really happy with the football we played.<br /><br />We scored a very, very good goal but it’s disappointing at the moment that we’re making some decisions defensively that are resulting in goals<br /><br />We’re going to have eliminate these errors that result in goals because they’re soft. Maybe we could be slightly fresher but it didn’t affect the outcome of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Both coaches were left frustrated after Monday night’s 0-0 draw between Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory in the A-League]</b> We improved dramatically in the second half. In the second half we were much better in possession of the ball and it’s no coincidence that you start creating some chances. It’s a missed opportunity for us in terms of taking two extra points. But after we review this game I dare say there’ll be some room for improvement.</p>

Everything’s dictated to by what happens out on the training pitch and Fahid’s trained really well this week.<br /><br />Any decision I make, as small as someone might think it is or as big as someone might think it is, it’s a decision that’s based on what’s best for the football team, and then what’s best for the football club</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory captain Carl Valeri has signed a year’s contract extension to remain at the club until 2017-18]</b> Carl has been a terrific leader on and off the pitch for Melbourne Victory, and we’re excited to extend his contract. Carl leads by example, demands excellence and has been an asset to this football club over the last three seasons. He brings composure and a winning attitude to the playing group, is a great role model and his thirst for success is infectious. This is a great outcome for the club and the playing group as we head into an important part of our season</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat is concerned with his side’s lack of defensive concentration ahead of Saturday’s A-League clash with Perth Glory]</b> If you look at those goals, it’s not as if we’re getting carved open… it’s that concentration, those moments in time because you look at last week’s goal and <b>[Josh]</b> Brillante’s got the ball in his own half, seemingly no danger, and then all of a sudden we have one opportunity to clear it, a second opportunity to clear it and a cross comes in and we’re not picking up in the box. So it’s not as if we’re getting carved open<br /><br />It’s not really a big skill set you need to be dealing with these situations. It’s a mindset and an attitude and an awareness of what’s going on around you<br /><br />The only thing that I’d like to change is that we perform to our capabilities for longer. This season it hasn’t really happened often enough where we’ve performed to our level for 90 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Why Perth Glory are willing to wait for Diego Castro’s signature]</b> Castro is a phenomenal player. So I’m mindful of when we’re attacking our responsibility is to ensure that when we’ve got the ball that he can’t hurt us. That might sound confusing but he’s at his most dangerous when you’re attacking, so <b>[we need to make]</b> sure he’s looked after because he supplies the likes of Taggart, Keogh and <b>[Chris]</b> Harold.</p>

We know to get to the Grand Final and to win it, you’ve got to be performing really well, at your top. We asked the group during the week and today … because our good has been very good, it’s been enough but we haven’t quite done that for long enough in games. That’s been the focus, let’s start preparing for the finals by being good for longer. As the second half went on, I thought that’s exactly what we did tonight and we took some chances and in the end, there were a plethora of chances we maybe could have scored from</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Kevin Muscat was frustrated by his team’s 3-0 defeat to Wellington Phoenix on Sunday]</b> I can’t remember the last time I have come here and been so disappointed in the performance. You can’t get to the finals coasting and flick a switch and then you perform well. You might do it for 10 minutes, you might do it for a half. If you’re lucky, you might do it for a game. But it won’t last. That’s the biggest challenge for me and the group. To make sure, we’ve had a good season, to not just coast our way to the finals and then expect to perform well in them.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat has fired the first shot in the lead-up to the 2017 A-League Grand Final]</b> One thing’s going to change - the most important thing - we’re going to beat them. That’s the thing that’s going to change. It’s a grand final. You won’t hear too much from me throughout the week because the time for the words will stop Sunday evening and the actions will determine the game. And off that performance there, the number of chances we created and not allowing Brisbane into the game at all tonight gives me great confidence, and gives the playing group some real, serious belief.<br /><br />The performance was outstanding from start to finish. We understand and we spoke about it, unfortunately we had a little bit of time to do so, executing in finals football - the intensity’s that little bit higher. I thought, when we didn’t have the ball, our intensity to get it back was frightening, which didn’t allow them to get a foothold in the game … and then we got it, I thought we were outstanding</p>

It’s well known that we like versatility in our squad and not only is Rhys an outstanding defender, he is also very good on the ball and is equally comfortable playing as a full-back or even in midfield.</p>

Kosta is a player who really complements the way we like to play and to be able to sign him for the next two years is a big boost so early in the recruiting process. There’s no doubt in my mind that his best years are still ahead of him, so he’ll be an important player as we navigate our way through a busy campaign that also includes AFC Champions League. I’m sure our fans will be thrilled with this news as the build-up to next season continues</p>
