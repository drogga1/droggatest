  <p><b>[Motivation isn’t a problem at Melbourne Victory, with coach Kevin Muscat claiming his players are so thirsty for improvement]</b> The things that are driven from the playing group themselves bear the most weight. It’s as simple as that. We’re travelling along very well at the moment in terms of the way we’re playing. There are players who are not in the team, who believe they should be in the team and it’s pretty simple - you’re history’s not going to get you back into the team. Being consistently better than the person who’s playing in your position is going to get you back into the team, so if you’re not thirsty and you’re not hungry for that it’s not going to happen. Everyone will get an opportunity, everyone will be required at some point. It’s <b>[about]</b> making sure you’re prepared and ready for when that does happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Geria]</b> I think he’s <b>[Geria]</b> made a good solid decision that he wants to be the best player in his position in this country and in this competition, and then, you know what, once he does get to that he won’t be asking to get into the national team or people won’t be pushing his <b>[case]</b>, he’ll be selected. I think we’re fortunate that he’s committed his future to the football club</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat has claimed Brisbane Roar defender Luke DeVere told him Besart Berisha shouldn’t have been sent off]</b> Bes is really unlucky. I haven’t come across anyone that says it’s a red card. Luke DeVere comes up to me after the game and was embarrassed because he said ‘I wasn’t making a meal of it. It was accidental. I told the referee that.’ They were his words, not mine. Subsequently I’ve seen it. The ball’s coming up to him <b>[Berisha]</b>, he puts his arms out and he doesn’t even know where Luke DeVere is but the decision’s been made. We move on.<br /><br /><b>[Many Victory fans must be expecting their club will appeal Berisha’s sanction]</b> As far as I know there are no grounds to appeal.<br /><br />That first 27 minutes we played some great football and they were on the back foot. Let’s call a spade a spade. They were on the back foot, we were dominating with presence, with a clear intent to attack. Through our own fault, we got Brisbane back into the game</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC know Melbourne Victory can beat them]</b> If we put every brick in place, we’ll beat them. If we prepare well, which we have, if we turn up, if we deliver our best is good enough to beat them. We know that and they know it also. If we start worrying and concentrating on that I dare say we’ll miss the detail and detail in the last two games has cost us points<br /><br />I don’t really get sentimental … but this one particularly, I felt the need to remind the players and congratulate him <b>[Broxham]</b> in front of his peers because he’s stood the test of time. He’s really had to earn every one of those games. He’s someone who really epitomises what it’s all about at this football club - working hard, getting your head down, being humble, being respectful</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Kevin Muscat blamed poor decision-making for Melbourne Victory’s loss to Sydney FC]</b> It’s our own doing if we were. I’m not walking away from tonight terrified whatsoever. I will never give up trying to catch <b>[Sydney]</b>. We haven’t been opened up tonight. We haven’t been out-passed or outplayed. I was really happy with the football we played.<br /><br />We scored a very, very good goal but it’s disappointing at the moment that we’re making some decisions defensively that are resulting in goals<br /><br />We’re going to have eliminate these errors that result in goals because they’re soft. Maybe we could be slightly fresher but it didn’t affect the outcome of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Both coaches were left frustrated after Monday night’s 0-0 draw between Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory in the A-League]</b> We improved dramatically in the second half. In the second half we were much better in possession of the ball and it’s no coincidence that you start creating some chances. It’s a missed opportunity for us in terms of taking two extra points. But after we review this game I dare say there’ll be some room for improvement.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat has refused to comment on speculation that Fahid Ben Khalfallah hasn’t played in two weeks due to a contract dispute]</b> We don’t discuss contracts, so I think it’d be disrespectful to any of the individuals, who we’re talking about and that’s something that we’ve done right throughout <b>[the club’s history]</b>. Everything’s dictated to by what happens out on the training pitch and Fahid’s trained really well this week.<br /><br />Any decision I make, as small as someone might think it is or as big as someone might think it is, it’s a decision that’s based on what’s best for the football team, and then what’s best for the football club</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory captain Carl Valeri has signed a year’s contract extension to remain at the club until 2017-18]</b> Carl has been a terrific leader on and off the pitch for Melbourne Victory, and we’re excited to extend his contract. Carl leads by example, demands excellence and has been an asset to this football club over the last three seasons. He brings composure and a winning attitude to the playing group, is a great role model and his thirst for success is infectious. This is a great outcome for the club and the playing group as we head into an important part of our season</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat is concerned with his side’s lack of defensive concentration ahead of Saturday’s A-League clash with Perth Glory]</b> If you look at those goals, it’s not as if we’re getting carved open… it’s that concentration, those moments in time because you look at last week’s goal and <b>[Josh]</b> Brillante’s got the ball in his own half, seemingly no danger, and then all of a sudden we have one opportunity to clear it, a second opportunity to clear it and a cross comes in and we’re not picking up in the box. So it’s not as if we’re getting carved open<br /><br />It’s not really a big skill set you need to be dealing with these situations. It’s a mindset and an attitude and an awareness of what’s going on around you<br /><br />The only thing that I’d like to change is that we perform to our capabilities for longer. This season it hasn’t really happened often enough where we’ve performed to our level for 90 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Why Perth Glory are willing to wait for Diego Castro’s signature]</b> Castro is a phenomenal player. So I’m mindful of when we’re attacking our responsibility is to ensure that when we’ve got the ball that he can’t hurt us. That might sound confusing but he’s at his most dangerous when you’re attacking, so <b>[we need to make]</b> sure he’s looked after because he supplies the likes of Taggart, Keogh and <b>[Chris]</b> Harold.</p>

Listening to Keisuke’s answers, he’s a winner and his frame of mind is always positive. He’s applied himself in the right manner at every opportunity</p>
