  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz explains about his success after the age of 30]</b> There’s no magic potion. I suppose it’s got something to do with my genes, so it’s my parents I should be thanking. There’s also the fact that I really enjoy what I do. That’s the biggest secret</p>

  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz believes defending champions Spain are heading into Euro 2016 as the favourites]</b> Today, the best team is the one with the most options. Spain is favourite because they are the reigning champion and because they have shown that they are able to compete with the best. Spain has been the dominant force in recent years. They have earned that credit.<br /><br />I try to do my best work. I’d love to go <b>[to Euro 2016]</b>, but the decision is not in my hands. I’m under no illusions. There is still a long time until June. Before then, I have some nice challenges with Athletic</p>

  <p><b>[Athletic Bilbao striker Aritz Aduriz has announced he will retire at the end of the 2019-20 season]</b> I wanted to communicate that this year is going to be my last year as a professional. I will leave football when I finish this season. It makes me especially excited to be able to leave it at Athletic. The aim of saying it now is to avoid distractions so I can focus everything on the team. Hopefully we can end the year with something very nice and we can offer all our fans something beautiful. I feel very happy to be able to leave football at Athletic. I will compete and enjoy every day until the end. We believe the end never comes, but choosing the end and where I will be at the end is an immense privilege. It is a thoughtful decision, which I could’ve taken last year, but circumstances have made it this year. It is a decision made with my family. I am very proud that I end at Athletic</p>

  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz said he will always be available to help Athletic Bilbao until the last day after his stunning bicycle kick downed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> 1-0 in the <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> opener]</b> The team has been amazing. There is no better way to start than by adding three points against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I said I was going to be there to help Athletic until the last day and today I have been able to prove it. The atmosphere of San Mames is always insurmountable, but it is true that today people have taken this game even more eagerly.<br /><br />Athletic’s base is young people. You have to give them confidence and go slowly with them. They will help us a lot throughout the year. Dedicated to my family and everyone who supports me. These kind of things make football so beautiful. Everything in life has a start and a finish. I’m grateful to be able to choose to end things where I’m happiest</p>

  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz hopes to end his Athletic Bilbao career by winning the Copa del Rey, admitting he had grown tired of watching <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> win everything]</b> <b>[The new format]</b> is not discredited; on the contrary, it has more value. We are a little tired of seeing <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> win everything. But it is nice to see competitions with more dynamism. You can see it in England, <b>[where]</b> it’s enriching. It’s a format that people like. I have been fantasising about <b>[winning the cup]</b> for a long time. At the beginning, it was a fantasy, and it may be closer now, although it is very difficult. Imagine retiring from football this season and winning a title. It’s anyone’s dream<br /><br />I love VAR. It is clear that we have to improve. It is new and it will evolve, but there is more success than the opposite. It makes me calmer on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz does not see his retirement nor Athletic Bilbao’s Copa del Rey final with <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> as important amid the coronavirus pandemic]</b> This coronavirus crisis is forcing us to think twice and consider what matters. And now my retirement, or football in general, or if we will play <b>[the Copa del Rey final]</b> or not doesn’t matter. I think there are many other more important things to stop and solve. I’m sure with everyone’s help together, with each of us playing our role, we will get ahead of it. That’s what I’m focused on at this moment and that’s the most important thing<br /><br />Maybe all of us are keeping in mind the Copa del Rey final, but we’re prioritising other things now. We’re all going through a tough time where many people are struggling a lot and even passing away … so, the final of the Copa has its importance, but maybe not that much now. There are other things we need to solve together, and if the day <b>[of the final]</b> finally comes, I’m Donostiarra <b>[people originally from San Sebastian]</b>. I’ve always felt very comfortable in Donostia <b>[the city’s Basque name]</b> and that won’t change whatever happens in any football game. I’m sure they will treat me in the same way, no doubt<br /><br />If we’ve learned something from this pandemic or virus that we’re struggling with, it’s that we should think twice about what is important. I sincerely believe the people who really deserve a statue and recognition are clear nowadays, and it’s not me or any football player. I would build a statue to those who are battling every day at the very front line against the virus in all the hospitals. They’re showing us what really matters. We have to realise what’s important and what isn’t. And this is probably showing us that football isn’t important enough for this kind of recognition</p>

  <p><b>[Athletic Club striker Aritz Aduriz announces retirement and needs hip replacement surgery]</b> The time has come. Many times, I have said that football will leave you before you leave it. Yesterday, the doctors told me to go to see the surgeon, sooner rather than later, to get a prosthetic to replace my hip and to try and go about my everyday life, as normally as possible. Unfortunately, my body has said ‘enough’. I can’t help my team-mates the way I would like to, nor the way that they deserve. That is the life of a professional athlete. Simple, very simple<br /><br />Unfortunately, we are living through situations much more grim and painful; the pandemic that we are suffering from has left us with irreparable damage and we have to keep fighting it, together. Therefore, I don’t want you to worry about me, this is just an anecdote. Let’s forget about the finals we dreamt about, because we will have time to say goodbye. And yes, the time has come to say goodbye, and this is how the road ends for me - unforgettable and marvellous, from beginning to end. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart</p>

  <p><b>[Aritz Aduriz denied fairytale send-off but his Athletic legacy will live on]</b> The time has come. I have said many times that football leaves you before you leave it. Just yesterday doctors advised I undergo surgery, the sooner the better, to implant a prosthetic hip and try to at least face day-to-day life in the best way possible. Unfortunately my body has said, ‘enough’… Forget about the dream finals, we’ll have time to say goodbye. The time to say farewell has come and here my unforgettable, wonderful road from start to finish comes to an end</p>
