  <p><b>[<a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a> winger James McClean has hit out at the English <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a>, labelling them ‘a bunch of cowards’ for their apparent failure to deal with the racism he receives]</b> The only reason I highlighted it <b>[the birthday card abuse that he shared on Instagram]</b> and the only reason I put it up was to prove a point and I think proved it right. It’s that Kick It Out and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> are a bunch of hypocrites, a bunch of cowards. Look at the Sterling case, previously. He’s been lauded as this kind of hero for speaking out. Getting awards and this and that. What he got is nothing compared to what I’ve got for the past seven or eight years.<br /><br />And there hasn’t been a peep, a single word or contact. I got a token gesture from Kick It Out after people highlighted it and went after them. Nothing will ever be done. I’m a white Irishman, to put it bluntly. That’s not high on the agenda in England. It’s just a fact of proving a point that they are a bunch of hypocrites and a bunch of cowards. They <b>[<a href="fa.html">the FA</a>]</b> never contacted me for starters. Do you watch Sky Sports News? Have you ever seen a story about me being discriminated against? There wasn’t a peep about the birthday card. So, just be consistent.<br /><br /><b>[McClean was given a written warning by <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> after his goal celebration in a game for West Brom in 2015 where he appeared to taunt Sunderland supporters]</b> The same thing happened this year, with the Middlesbrough game where I clearly got abused. People were trying to come on the pitch and I called them uneducated cavemen, which they were. I’m getting a warning from <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>. It’s only when I fire back at <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> publicly that they kind of back off and just give me a warning rather than taking any action. But sure, that’s what it is.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he thought Sterling would be reprimanded if he called supporters ‘uneducated cavemen’, McClean continued:]</b> ‘No, he’d probably have got another award’</p>

  <p><b>[James McClean has been fined two weeks wages and agreed to delete his Instagram account after appearing to make a joke regarding the Irish Repuclican Army]</b> <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a> can confirm that, following an internal disciplinary review, disciplinary action has been taken against James McClean for an inappropriate social media post. McClean has been fined two weeks’ wages by the Club and has also agreed to delete his Instagram account. The player has expressed contrition and recognises that the post was ill-advised and offensive. The Club and the player will be making no further comment on the matter</p>

  <p><b>[James McClean has been fined two weeks wages and agreed to delete his Instagram account after appearing to make a joke regarding the Irish Repuclican Army]</b> I never wanted to cause any offence but I now realise that I did so and for that I apologise unreservedly. I have spoken to the club and will be deleting my Instagram account<br /><br />If the poppy was simply about World War One and Two victims alone, I’d wear it without a problem. I would wear it every day of the year if that was the thing but it doesn’t. It stands for all the conflicts that Britain has been involved in. Because of the history where I come from in Derry, I cannot wear something that represents that.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a> winger James McClean has insisted that the photo he put up on Instagram which showed him teaching his children in a balaclava was supposed to be a light-hearted joke]</b> I never wanted to cause any offence but I now realise I did so and for that, I apologise unreservedly. I have spoken to the club and will be deleting my Instagram account<br /><br />If I sat here and said I don’t regret things I’d be lying but I can take a lot of abuse and can’t have fun back? It was supposed to be a light-hearted joke but I can understand why it didn’t go down well. People think I did a history lesson like that but I didn’t actually do it<br /><br /><b>[Health Secretary Matt Hancock called on <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> stars to play their part in the fight against Covid-19 by taking a pay cut]</b> It’s ridiculous. You’ve got Matt Hancock saying we should take a pay cut. No one seems to like footballers. We’ve got livelihoods too and people might take this the wrong way but we do work hard for our money. Think about what players pay towards government tax. Football is a short career and we’ve got to look after our families once it’s over. I’ve seen players do great deeds from their own pocket</p>

  <p><b>[James McClean on sectarian abuse: People need to be held responsible]</b> People need to be held responsible for their words and actions. What leaves a sour taste though - and not only this, but with everything else of late - I receive and have received more abuse than any other player during my nine years in England, whether that be death threats, bullets sent in the post, birthday cards, letters etc!<br /><br />This is not a cry for sympathy but one to ask the question: What is the difference? 12-year-old boy gets arrested for posting racial abuse online to <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> - again rightly so. Has anyone ever been held accountable for mine? No! Have I ever had my abuse condemned by the media? No! In fact, quite the opposite; the slightest thing that I do that might cause offence to anyone is highlighted by them. I have seen some of my Irish team-mates post a black square in support of anti-racism as well as post condemning the discrimination and AGAIN rightly so! Have I ever seen any of them post a public condemnation of the discrimination I get, which funnily enough is a discrimination against them also? That would be a no! Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination? I would say I am confused but that’s the wrong word because confused means not fully understanding something. In this case, it’s quite clear. If you don’t stand for something, you will fall for anything</p>
