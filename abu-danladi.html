<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Abu Danladi’s delayed arrival finally happens]</b> I thought about it, and went through it with my family and getting the opportunity to come to the United States I always wanted to pursue my education. UCLA is a great school and when I got the opportunity I wanted to make the best out of it. I owe it to myself and to my family back home to finish school. I just wanted to go to college and get close to my degree and I am now.<br /><br />Being around all the meetings and being around Minnesota’s coaching staff, and Adrian, was huge. He’s a really passionate guy, and with his reputation in the league for developing players like me as forwards, it didn’t matter what pick they had. I knew I would love to play for him. I wanted to play for him and I knew it was his decision to make. I showed him what I can do, and he knows I have more to show</p>
