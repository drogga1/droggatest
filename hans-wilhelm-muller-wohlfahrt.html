  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola has been accused of overestimating himself and believing he knows better than anybody]</b> He completely neglected the medical profession. It was not about recovery of the players, but only freedom from pain. It was not about the healing of injuries, it was completely against my philosophy. He underestimated me and wanted to make me a commander. He overestimated himself and thinks he knows better than anybody, but I was too big for him. I had a wonderful status at the club. He could not bear that I was the same as him, so I had to be trimmed and he used every opportunity to dupe me<br /><br />I think Pep Guardiola is a person with a weak self-confidence who does everything to hide that from other people. Because of that he seems to live in a constant fear. Not so much of defeats but of the loss of power and authority</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich complete club-record €80m Lucas Hernandez signing]</b> In our sports medical examination, we found damage to the inner ligament of the right knee, which must be repaired surgically. In my experience, Lucas Hernandez will be available to FC Bayern for the start of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season.</p>
