  <p><b>[Premier League attacker Ayoze Perez reveals Barcelona interest]</b> I only think of Newcastle, it is true that there was interest in Barca but I am here and we have to keep working. Thank God there was interest from several teams - for a footballer it is important. It was a disappointing year due to the relegation. Things did not go as I wanted but there were still some clubs interested that knocked on the door. It’s a good thing but I have my head in Newcastle and we’ll see what happens in the future.<br /><br />Under Rafa, I think the future will be very interesting. Let’s see what happens, but it could be a great future. He is very important for us now and next season</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez turned down Barcelona and Real Madrid in the past]</b> am very grateful to Newcastle - I have grown and matured here, but it is obvious that someday I would like to come back and play in La Liga. To this day, I do not know <b>[what the future holds]</b>. I hope something very good. I believe that I have shown my merit during these five years so that a good opportunity presents itself.<br /><br /><b>[Former Liverpool star Luis Garcia has suggested that the Newcastle frontman deserves a senior international call-up]</b> I appreciate the words of Luis Garcia. He sees me play and he knows that I have not always been able to develop my football; he knows how much I sacrifice myself and that, in the five years that I have been here, I have always tried to give the maximum. I work to be there <b>[in the Spain squad]</b> some day. Obviously, I know it’s complicated because there are many top-level players, but I try to show that I can be there. Of course <b>[I feel ready to represent my country]</b>. I am ready and I have tremendous hope of being able to see myself in a Spain squad. It would be incredible for me. I will keep fighting and hope it happens</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez admits it is special to have earned the slightest comparison to Lionel Messi]</b> Messi is my all-time hero, head and shoulders above every footballer in the world. So to be mentioned in the same sentence by someone I respect so much was special. It also told me I must be doing something right as well.<br /><br />I cannot pretend it was an easy situation. In fact, it was a very difficult time. In that period, you lean on those closest to you and my family helped a lot. They realised what was going on and tried to find the right words without lying to me. But you are the only one who can get yourself out of it. Every player goes through tough moments but it is how you react that is important. That will show up first the person you are, then the footballer</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle forward Ayoze Perez has said he is ready to leave the club this summer]</b> I believe in career cycles and when one is close to ending you start to plan things. It’s the moment for a change. And probably this is that moment. Going back to your country and playing for a big team and being able to enjoy playing La Liga would be a good thing for my career<br /><br />My idea is to return to Spanish football, I want to play for a big club in La Liga, that would be great for my career. I have adapted to this league and have good goalscoring numbers but life here is not as good as in Spain<br /><br /><b>[Perez was capped by Spain’s U-21 side earlier in his career, but has yet to play for La Roja at senior level]</b> It’s a dream that I still want to fulfill. I thought I had a chance with the last squad. I am trying to do something so that they take notice of this kid from the Canary Islands</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United forward Ayoze Perez has opened up about his partnership with fellow striker Salomon Rondon]</b> We’ve got an amazing relationship. If he gets the chance to give me a goal, he’ll do it, and it’s the same the other way around. The main thing is to win matches and it means a lot.<br /><br />I came here as a striker as I was number nine for my old team, Tenerife. You grow up having that in your mind. You know the movements and you live your life in the penalty area. I always try to get into good positions. I’m always looking to cash in on a little deflection or trying to get into the box for the second ball. They are the things that make a difference. You have to get in there to have the chance. I always have that in mind. I used to be a striker and that’s why I am how I am</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez has suggested that a ‘long summer’ could lead him away from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> It’s something that I cannot say right now. You cannot guarantee it. We’ll see. It’s going to be a long summer. Obviously, there’s going to be a day where you make a decision. It depends on many things. Let’s see what happens. Obviously, this place is always going to be in my heart, whatever happens. We’ll see what happens.<br /><br /><b>[While hinting at a switch elsewhere, Perez concedes he will find it difficult to drag himself away from St James’s Park]</b><br /><br />Yes, that’s something that’s always in <b>[my]</b> mind. This kind of environment … you don’t see it in many places. We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a long summer, whatever can happen. I cannot guarantee anything, but we’ll see. It’s time to rest, to enjoy and be with my family and friends. We’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez has explained why he snubbed advances from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> The Under-21s of Madrid and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wanted me but that would mean I was going to play in the second division again. The offers were of <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a>, first team, and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> first team as well. Obviously, being in a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is always special but that second team option made me think maybe it wasn’t the right move. I was close to moving to <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a>, very, very close. Just little details were delaying the move but at that moment <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> made a call and were very interested in me. They didn’t fight for the little details. I always had the dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so that was the opportunity<br /><br />He’s a great manager. A very good manager. You can tell because it’s a young squad and he’s getting the best out of it. That’s not easy. In terms of football he’s very clever. He knows what he wants and tries to make the squad think we can be a top team. We have the quality but it’s not enough with that we need a mix of everything. He’s very close to the players in terms of personal stuff. That’s important in terms of football and the dressing room. It’s that kind of manager that looks after every detail. At the end of the day that matters a lot and that’s very important and that’s why we are doing so well</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez believes <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> have regained momentum in race for Champions League place]</b> It was important, especially at home. There were a couple of games when we didn’t find our best performances, or the result either, so it was important to get the three points. Our schedule is not easy but with this <b>[positive]</b> mentality, we can keep our position. We have another tough test on Tuesday <b>[away to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> but we are ready for it. The team is getting better, it’s getting that confidence and it’s building that momentum back again<br /><br />We need to think about ourselves, it’s still in our hands. We have done some great work in the past and we cannot throw that away. <b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> are obviously putting us under pressure but it’s in our hands and that’s the positive thing<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> is the latest player to join <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> 100 club, take a look at some of his best goals here]</b> It’s an unbelievable achievement. He is a top striker, one of the best in Europe. We’re talking about the best league in the world, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and he managed to get 100 goals. Hopefully there are more to come and he can win the Golden Boot. For me, he is in the top three strikers for running in behind <b>[the defence]</b>. The goal is always is in his mind and he makes it look easy. We are lucky to have him and his goals have helped us a lot.</p>
