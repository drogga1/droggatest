  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez has suggested that a ‘long summer’ could lead him away from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> It’s something that I cannot say right now. You cannot guarantee it. We’ll see. It’s going to be a long summer. Obviously, there’s going to be a day where you make a decision. It depends on many things. Let’s see what happens. Obviously, this place is always going to be in my heart, whatever happens. We’ll see what happens.<br /><br /><b>[While hinting at a switch elsewhere, Perez concedes he will find it difficult to drag himself away from St James’s Park]</b><br /><br />Yes, that’s something that’s always in <b>[my]</b> mind. This kind of environment … you don’t see it in many places. We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a long summer, whatever can happen. I cannot guarantee anything, but we’ll see. It’s time to rest, to enjoy and be with my family and friends. We’ll see</p>

Valencia are interested in making a move for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> forward Ayoze Perez.</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester have snapped up Ayoze Perez from Premier League rivals <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, with a £30 million release clause in the striker’s contract at St James’s Park activated]</b> I’m very happy and very pleased. I’m very proud to be part of the Leicester family and I can’t wait to get started. The club want to keep growing as much as they can and that’s something I like. I spoke with the manager and that was important. That made me feel very comfortable about the decision to come here.</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez has explained why he snubbed advances from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Barcelona]</b> The Under-21s of Madrid and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wanted me but that would mean I was going to play in the second division again. The offers were of Porto, first team, and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> first team as well. Obviously, being in a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is always special but that second team option made me think maybe it wasn’t the right move. I was close to moving to Porto, very, very close. Just little details were delaying the move but at that moment <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> made a call and were very interested in me. They didn’t fight for the little details. I always had the dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so that was the opportunity<br /><br />He’s a great manager. A very good manager. You can tell because it’s a young squad and he’s getting the best out of it. That’s not easy. In terms of football he’s very clever. He knows what he wants and tries to make the squad think we can be a top team. We have the quality but it’s not enough with that we need a mix of everything. He’s very close to the players in terms of personal stuff. That’s important in terms of football and the dressing room. It’s that kind of manager that looks after every detail. At the end of the day that matters a lot and that’s very important and that’s why we are doing so well</p>

  <p><b>[Ayoze Perez believes <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> have regained momentum in race for Champions League place]</b> It was important, especially at home. There were a couple of games when we didn’t find our best performances, or the result either, so it was important to get the three points. Our schedule is not easy but with this <b>[positive]</b> mentality, we can keep our position. We have another tough test on Tuesday <b>[away to Arsenal]</b> but we are ready for it. The team is getting better, it’s getting that confidence and it’s building that momentum back again<br /><br />We need to think about ourselves, it’s still in our hands. We have done some great work in the past and we cannot throw that away. <b>[Chelsea and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> are obviously putting us under pressure but it’s in our hands and that’s the positive thing<br /><br /><b>[Leicester’s <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> is the latest player to join <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> 100 club, take a look at some of his best goals here]</b> It’s an unbelievable achievement. He is a top striker, one of the best in Europe. We’re talking about the best league in the world, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and he managed to get 100 goals. Hopefully there are more to come and he can win the Golden Boot. For me, he is in the top three strikers for running in behind <b>[the defence]</b>. The goal is always is in his mind and he makes it look easy. We are lucky to have him and his goals have helped us a lot.</p>
