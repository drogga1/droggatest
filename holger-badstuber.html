  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defender Holger Badstuber moved by the crowd’s standing ovation on his return from injury]</b> That is outstanding, that’s a really great gesture and gave me goosebumps</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber is targeting securing a place in Germany’s squad for Euro 2016]</b> The European Championship is still far away. The national team is also an issue again at some point, but not currently. All the foundations have been laid for it and I’m ready, but first I want to make my contribution at Bayern again permanently<br /><br />Heading back to #Munich. We had a great time in the Alps with time to rest and to set new goals</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have confirmed that Holger Badstuber has joined Schalke on loan until the end of the season]</b> I’m thankful that Bayern have complied with my request. I’d like to get some much-needed match practice at Schalke and I’m looking forward to my time in Gelsenkirchen.</p>

  <p><b>[Holger Badstuber also found Pep Guardiola to be aloof and standoffish in comparison to Carlo Ancelotti]</b> Our current coach likes to exchange opinions with the players, and so the conversation goes back and forth. With Pep, it was different. I would have to approach him because if I want to have a discussion, then I would have to go looking for him</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Holger Badstuber has revealed he is still in touch with Pep Guardiola]</b> I still have contact with Pep several times a year. We have a good relationship, because we also really understand each other as humans. Pep is pleased that I’m back in full swing. He has had a great season with City, extended his contract and is now planning for the new season. I’m grateful to Stuttgart for the season, with our finish and my personal achievements. I have been backed up in my feeling that Stuttgart was the right decision.<br /><br />It would be wrong to close the door at Stuttgart, but now I have this great urge to play internationally. My goal is not the Europa League, but the Champions League. I do not want to confine myself to moving abroad, but of course that would be an experience that I would like to do someday. There is interest and offers from abroad. The only thing that stands firm for me is that I don’t want to wait as long as last year, but have a complete preseason.</p>
