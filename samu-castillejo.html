  <p><b>[Samu Castillejo thinks he has finally found his feet at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and hopes to stay at the club for a long time]</b> Those who know me know how tough I am, beyond the appearance I give with my hair and tattoos. I’m a very humble boy. The first year was adaptive, it is difficult to show what you can do when getting just 15 minutes and only starting one game every two or three weeks. If there is confidence and you’re made to feel important you feel better about yourself. I always wanted to succeed here. I want to stay at the club for a long time. The truth is that 2020 had started well. I have played every game and at a good level. I hope it continues like this.<br /><br /><b>[Castillejo is enjoying working alongside veteran striker Ibrahimovic]</b> He is a very humble guy. He is a guy who gets along with all his team-mates, off the pitch he is a real joker and nice. During games he knows how to give advice. You can tell he came to help us; sharing the dressing room and the pitch with him makes you learn a lot</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> winger Samu Castillejo robbed at gun point]</b> Is everything fine in Milan? Two guys have robbed me while pointing a gun at my face. Those who know me know how tough I am, beyond the appearance I give with my hair and tattoos. I’m a very humble boy. The first year was adaptive, it is difficult to show what you can do when getting just 15 minutes and only starting one game every two or three weeks. If there is confidence and you’re made to feel important you feel better about yourself. I always wanted to succeed here. I want to stay at the club for a long time. The truth is that 2020 had started well. I have played every game and at a good level. I hope it continues like this</p>
