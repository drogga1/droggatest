  <p><b>[Glasglow Rangers legend Barry Ferguson says Steven Gerrard is setting himself up to walk into a managerial post at Liverpool ‘the moment Jurgen Klopp decides he has achieved all he can’]</b> Let’s be honest, we’ve all known from day one that Steven Gerrard hopes to go back to his own spiritual home at Anfield the way Lampard has returned to Stamford Bridge. But I just hope he has to wait an awful lot longer than his old England team-mate. And the good news is if his dream is to manage Liverpool one day, first he’s going to have to take Rangers back to the top of Scottish football. If he can do that and win the title he’ll walk straight back to Merseyside the moment Jurgen Klopp decides he has achieved all he can in England. But that all depends on the job he does right now. Gerrard has to make Rangers successful or it will throw a massive spanner in his works.<br /><br />If he can then, like Lampard, he won’t have to make the journey back home in steps or stop off along the way to cut his teeth a bit more with a West Ham or a Wolves. No, he’ll be fast-tracked directly into the one job he wants above all others. And in the meantime he can focus entirely on finishing the job he has started with Rangers because he has made some humongous strides up here over the last 12 months.<br /><br /><b>[With Rangers having finished nine points behind Scottish Premiership champions Celtic in 2018-19, Ferguson]</b> Gerrard won’t want to move on until he has achieved what he set out to do when he took this job on. You can tell when you listen to the guy he is as desperate to get Rangers back to the top of the Scottish game as any of the diehards in the stands. So what he has to do now is lead the club to some cup finals and make Rangers properly competitive in the title race by taking it down to the wire. Any thoughts the manager might have of following Lampard’s lead will have to wait. There’s a huge job for Stevie G to be getting on with and the most important part of this entire project is just about to begin</p>

  <p><b>[Former Scotland skipper Barry Ferguson is a big fan of <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> he feels should be fast-tracked to the senior international stage]</b> There’s something special about <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a>. Something very different from the rest. I am absolutely convinced this kid is going all the way to the top. I’m excited for him. I’m excited for his family. But most of all I’m excited for Scottish football because I truly believe we’ll be building our national team around this boy for many, many years to cone. To put it simply, we haven’t produced a player like this in decades. That’s not me having a pop at the likes of <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>, <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> or <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> - who have all made it to the highest level of the English game. These guys are outstanding football players and will be Scotland internationals for years to come. But, like I say, there’s something special about Billy. Something different.<br /><br />Technically, there is no doubt in my mind that he has the ability to go as far in the game as he wants to. But we’ve all seen young boys come through in the past who had the world at their feet but who never quite managed to reach their full potential. The thing that makes Billy that little bit different from the rest is his desire, attitude and hunger. I see it all in his eyes and that’s why I am so convinced we are talking about a special player. When I look at this kid I can’t help but think about Andy Murray leaving Dunblane at a similar age to make it as a tennis player in Spain. That’s the sort of single-minded attitude you have to admire and it’s why I really believe Billy has got it all going for him. Put it this way, if I was Stevie Clarke I’d be having a good hard think about whether or not to bring him straight into the full Scotland set-up. And, after mulling over for five minutes, I would probably call him up for the next squad and next month’s double header with Russia and San Marino</p>
