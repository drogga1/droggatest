<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Zlatan: Jordan shows what playing ‘with a winner’ is like in The Last Dance]</b> Winning has a price and leadership has a price. I pulled people along when they didn’t want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didn’t want to be challenged. I earned that right because my team-mates came after me. They didn’t endure all the things that I endured. Once you join the team you live at a certain standard that I play the game, and I wasn’t going to take anything less</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan’s Last Dance documentary]</b> When people see this they are going say, ‘Well he wasn’t really a nice guy. He may have been a tyrant’. Well, that’s you. Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win to be a part of that as well. Look, I don’t have to do this. I am only doing it because it is who I am. That’s how I played the game. That was my mentality. If you don’t want to play that way, don’t play that way.</p>
