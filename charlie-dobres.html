<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Women’s football’s ‘existential crisis’ isn’t now]</b> When football gets to restart, this is a fork in the road. I think that one route is an existential crisis for women’s football. One possible reaction is, for teams funded by a larger men’s club, will that funding remain? Because I’ve seen situations in the past where men’s teams had a bad patch and the women’s team had their funding cut. The existential crisis is because if that happens on a massive scale, women’s teams losing support either from their club and/or from sponsors, then many won’t be able to operate. When you have an awful lot of clubs not being able to operate, then do you have a viable league?<br /><br />At the same time as being an existential crisis, it’s an existential opportunity as well. If, for example, when the men’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and Championship restart behind closed doors with their television deals, why not, in that situation, do a back-to-back with the women’s teams? Either the one that is your name or the one that is near to you. Because all of the practical problems in the past about that go away. Play two matches, put them both on television, one after the other with the same coverage and that way you suddenly level the playing field. The opportunity here is that women’s football gets massive exposure that it wouldn’t otherwise have had. I think what we’re looking for is really big, imaginative solutions to what is therefore an entirely avoidable moment for women’s football. The moment isn’t now, I don’t think. Although some will struggle, it isn’t predominantly now during the lockdown, when you can get grants and stuff. The moment is when we come out of it and then how do you support women’s football? That’s the big question.</p>
