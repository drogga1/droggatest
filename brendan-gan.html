<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brendan Gan believes Malaysia’s 2-1 win over Thailand was well worth his sacrifice]</b> I was with my son for just two days so it makes it all worth it. The other players are also sacrificing a lot of things to be here. We just have one thing in common… and that is to win for the national team. To me it doesn’t matter who scored and who assisted as long as we get to be the winner at the end of the day<br /><br /><b>[Brendan also paid tribute to the fans who rooted for them until the final whistle]</b> The atmosphere was unbelievable. The fans came out and they were our 12th man. They have always given us the support and we thank them for it. We have a great team, we play good football and tonight we put in a lot of effort, we ran a lot and that was the key for the win. The great thing about this team is whoever came in did the job well. It didn’t matter who started and it didn’t matter who came in from the bench, we all had one goal in mind and that was to win, to qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup. We pressured Thailand and made them make mistakes and we capitalised on that. It was a good game and we deserved the win<br /><br /><b>[Ahead of the match against Indonesia at the National Stadium on Tuesday, Brendan urged his teammates to maintain their focus to clinch another victory to improve on their chances of qualifying]</b> It’s very exciting to win this time but our job is not done yet. We still have Indonesia (to deal with) and we need to focus on that</p>
