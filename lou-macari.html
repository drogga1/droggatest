  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> I played with him briefly toward the end of his United career, and he was just gobsmacking to witness. He was 35 when I got to Old Trafford, and he was as fit and enthusiastic as a 25-year-old. He’d done so much, but his desire never faded - his work-rate kept him right at the top. He was still trying to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Lou Macari feels <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> needs more options at his disposal]</b> I thought in the last window, I thought there were players needed then. We didn’t bring the number in that I thought we should have brought in. When you have an injury or two and you look at your squad and the bench, it then hits you that you are so short of numbers. As the season goes on you will get people suspended, you’ll get more people injured. There’s no doubt that when the next window opens, and we’re looking a bit far ahead now, that one or two players need to come in.<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer conceded afterwards that further improvement is required from his side, with Macari echoing those sentiments after seeing <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> battle their way to three points]</b> I’m happy we won but I wasn’t all that convinced about the performance. I thought that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, with all the possession they had, didn’t really convince that they were going to open the door and get a goal. If they had got a little break at some stage in the game then they may have got that goal, it may have been 1-1 and we’d be sat here thinking a lot different. We have won the game, got three points and it pushes you up the table</p>
