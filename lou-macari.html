  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Sir Bobby Charlton</a>]</b> I played with him briefly toward the end of his United career, and he was just gobsmacking to witness. He was 35 when I got to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, and he was as fit and enthusiastic as a 25-year-old. He’d done so much, but his desire never faded - his work-rate kept him right at the top. He was still trying to improve</p>

  <p><b>[On Alexis Sanchez]</b> Beforehand we never looked like a team that could win the Champions League, but with him there stranger things have happened. There wouldn’t be many United supporters before saying there’s an outstanding chance of us winning the Champions League, but when you sign somebody like him it can be the turning point in your season in the biggest competition there is.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd warned spending big ‘hasn’t worked for years!]</b> I don’t think we can look at last season and look at the gap between ourselves and City and say anything else apart from that was probably a true reflection of the way both clubs played. Once that happens, the players’ job is to shorten that gap between you and them. What everyone forgets is that there is such a thing as hard work, coming back and bettering yourself, coming back and improving your own game, and trying to bridge that gap. But now everyone seems to talk about getting more players in, ‘Go get another three, get him, get him’. That hasn’t exactly worked in the last three or four years has it?<br /><br />It should do <b>[the gap behind City hurt the players]</b>! It was all over by January, and you can’t afford that to happen again. The players have got to realise that the demands of any player at Manchester United are colossal. During my 11 years there I saw good players come and go because they couldn’t handle Manchester United, they couldn’t handle the club. Well, you’ve got to! You’ve got to be able to handle it. Everyone’s had their say about Jose and everything, but I think the players have got to realise that they’ve got to up their game. And if they do up their game and the crowd see that, the crowd could lift them to a title, because once the crowd get behind you at Old Trafford it can work wonders for you. There were too many games last season where nothing happened and there was no reason for the crowd to get up and get behind them. If you can get the crowd responding to what they’re watching then they can help you close that gap</p>

  <p><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> When he came to the club he’d have realised how big a club it was, but I think he’s just finding out now how massive it is. All the attention’s on Manchester United because it’s the biggest, and I think he’s getting more than a little bit annoyed about all the headlines. I just think it’s a bit of a tough time for him at the moment. He’s been at Chelsea, and they would never attract the same attention as Man United, and there’s a different type of media probably in Spain when he was there and he’s been in Italy, but there’s nothing bigger than Manchester United and you’ve got to handle all sorts of things.<br /><br />You’ve got to win something wherever you are, but more so at Manchester United. If you win something, you haven’t failed, and obviously if you don’t win something then you have failed. Already, whether you like him or not, he’s won things. Even if you don’t like the style of play and all that, there are trophies there. That might not be good enough and Jose will realise that, and if he’s not happy with what he’s seeing then he’ll attempt to change things. But I think he’s finding it a little bit tough to concentrate on all of that. I think Jose will be starting to realise now that there’s a story from Manchester United every day even when there isn’t a story, and that wouldn’t have happened at his previous clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder Lou Macari has criticised <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> for inciting abuse from supporters after a home defeat to <a href="cardiff-city-fc.html">Cardiff City</a>]</b> Oh come on, come on! I haven’t come here today to <b>[see this]</b>. If it was somebody else I’d pick on somebody else. Whoever it would be I’d be saying: ‘what are you thinking about?’ Keep your strip on to start with, who else do you see with a strip off?<br /><br />Well he shouldn’t do!. He should get off the pitch and then send someone out with a strip. It’s all about discipline. The discipline here under Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Lou Macari feels <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> needs more options at his disposal]</b> I thought in the last window, I thought there were players needed then. We didn’t bring the number in that I thought we should have brought in. When you have an injury or two and you look at your squad and the bench, it then hits you that you are so short of numbers. As the season goes on you will get people suspended, you’ll get more people injured. There’s no doubt that when the next window opens, and we’re looking a bit far ahead now, that one or two players need to come in.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> conceded afterwards that further improvement is required from his side, with Macari echoing those sentiments after seeing <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> battle their way to three points]</b> I’m happy we won but I wasn’t all that convinced about the performance. I thought that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, with all the possession they had, didn’t really convince that they were going to open the door and get a goal. If they had got a little break at some stage in the game then they may have got that goal, it may have been 1-1 and we’d be sat here thinking a lot different. We have won the game, got three points and it pushes you up the table</p>
