  <p><b>[Francesco Totti was planning to miss his final penalty for Roma if presented with an opportunity]</b> He was nervous all week. One day he would say, ‘I’m quitting,’ and the next he would be, ‘I’m going to keep playing’. Before Roma-Genoa, we all got together in the dressing room and he said, ‘If I get a penalty, I won’t score it, I’ll kick the ball into the Curva <b>[Sud]</b>’. There wasn’t a penalty so instead he sent an autographed ball into the Curva after the game.<br /><br />Totti is a fantastic person and he deserves far more than just that party. He’s somebody who helps those in need a lot, without anybody needing to know about it. We’re honoured to have played alongside him in this, his final season with Roma. He could have won a lot at other clubs because there are technically few around in the world like him</p>
