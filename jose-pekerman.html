  <p><b>[Jose Pekerman on Falcao]</b> I think Falcao will be the best player at the World Cup. He has great qualities and a team that supports him at all times. He is smart and very technical. He is a unique player</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia coach Jose Pekerman stood up for Yerry Mina before the World Cup, criticising Barcelona for not playing him]</b> In the last few months in Barcelona he hasn’t played much and that’s not great, when he had to play they weren’t many expectations. Football is very fast, a very fast paced game, we have to decide very quickly what you’re going to do. I’m sure it was tough with him to cope with that situation, we have no doubts and we have no doubt about him being here. I think he’s got a great future in world football. We know that the current situation is difficult because it’s a very important club and he joined the club at a moment when they really wanted to play with just one play. It shouldn’t be like that, football is a team game and when you have a team you have to play the same way.</p>

  <p><b>[Why Colombia’s World Cup hero Yerry Mina has been a flop at Barcelona]</b> I have to say he’s coming out of a hard season with Barcelona. That game looked easy but it was not because they had already won the Spanish league and there was pressure on them to continue that undefeated streak. He did not play well in that <b>[Levante]</b> match. He didn’t play at the usual level we have come to expect. I think he was affected by a poor match of the whole team, Barcelona conceded several times against a team that usually doesn’t score so often. I’m sure that affected him and on top of that there are always other things on people’s minds since he was a key player in Brazil. He chose Barcelona thinking the situation would be different. I’m sure it was a hard time for him and that’s how he reached us at the World Cup but we never doubted him or his talent. I do think he’s going to be one of the greatest central defenders in the world, he has enormous potential. Obviously he needs to feel the support of his club, his team-mates, he needs to adapt to Barcelona in an ongoing context and he’ll play at the level he played at with the national team in the last game. I’m completely convinced of this, Yerry will go on to do great things.</p>

  <p><b>[Will James Rodriguez be fit to face England?]</b> What I can say is I’m extremely concerned, it’s a very tough situation for my team. I didn’t want to address this in comments because it seems one of these topics <b>[that]</b> can overshadow everything else. In the last Poland match James felt fatigue but it was only fatigue and that was due to him not being present in the previous match.</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia boss Jose Pekerman was also of the opinion that his side had plenty to be proud of, as they and England played out an intense clash.]</b> All the teams have that expectation of taking the trophy home, that’s why we compete. Like every other team here we also had that ambition and we made an effort. We think the team has made every effort to progress. This tonight was the last definitive duel. It was highly intense, very competitive and both sides have testified to the importance of this match</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Pekerman reveals his hopes for Colombia’s future after stepping down as coach]</b> My Colombian daughter must be sad, but I leave with happiness for having people’s support. I said it when I arrived, we need to work together, support the national team to achieve great things. There is a hard path that has been walked and we need to keep up the great work</p>
