  <p><b>[Analysis: Stones, Otamendi give Pep little food for thought]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> made six changes as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> hosted Bournemouth on Wednesday, potentially with one eye on this weekend’s FA Cup semi-final with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Among other things, it presented <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> and Nicolas Otamendi a chance to prove him wrong. Despite City’s defensive injury problems, the centre-back pairing have been picked together only twice all season - and one of those games was City’s calamitous 3-2 defeat at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> back in September. Plenty has been said about the club’s failure to replace <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> last summer, and perhaps this was a last-chance saloon for both to stake a claim for their City future. As it was, despite the Citizens’ victory, they did little to suggest Pep has been wrong to entrust even midfielder <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> or youngster <a href="eric-garcia.html">Eric Garcia</a> at the back ahead of picking them both. With both full-backs bombing on as usual, the defensive responsibility lay with them - and they struggled with Dominic Solanke, Junior Stanislas and <a href="joshua-king.html">Josh King</a> all evening. To put it into context, no side had previously managed more shots than City in a Premier League game at the Etihad in <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s four-year reign. The team to break that duck are third bottom, having previously scored 36 goals in 35 games</p>
