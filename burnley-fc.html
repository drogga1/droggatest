  <p><b>[Burnley will run out of money by August]</b> Burnley FC is keen to be transparent with supporters, staff and stakeholders and is therefore able to confirm that due to the continued suspension of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games this presents some significant challenges for the football club.<br /><br />Burnley FC are set to lose around £5 million in lost revenue from the remaining home games which in the event that the season finishes would be unlikely to be recouped owing to the likely prospect of these fixtures being played behind closed doors.<br /><br />In addition, the Clarets face missing out cash payments from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> of up to £45 million in broadcasting revenue and other items if the season is not finished. It is believed that other clubs could be looking at up to a £100m shortfall</p>

  <p><b>[White Live Matter, Burnley]</b> Burnley Football Club strongly condemns the actions of those responsible for the aircraft and offensive banner that flew over The <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a> on Monday evening. We wish to make it clear that those responsible are not welcome at Turf Moor. This, in no way, represents what Burnley Football Club stands for and we will work fully with the authorities to identify those responsible and issue lifetime bans. The club has a proud record of working with all genders, religions and faiths through its award-winning Community scheme, and stands against racism of any kind. We are fully behind <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s Black Lives Matter initiative and, in line with all other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games undertaken since Project Restart, our players and football staff willingly took the knee at kick-off at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. We apologise unreservedly to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and to all those helping to promote Black Lives Matter</p>
