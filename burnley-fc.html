  <p><b>[Burnley have confirmed that Peter Crouch will join the club from Stoke City until the end of the 2018-19 season]</b> The Clarets have added more England pedigree to their ranks with the capture of striker Peter Crouch. Crouch - who scored 22 times in 42 international appearances and becomes the seventh member of the Clarets’ squad to have been capped by England - joins Burnley from Stoke City on a deal until the end of the season. The 38-year-old, who will wear squad number 15 at Turf Moor, brings a wealth of Premier League experience following spells in the top flight with Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke.</p>

  <p><b>[Burnley will run out of money by August]</b> Burnley FC is keen to be transparent with supporters, staff and stakeholders and is therefore able to confirm that due to the continued suspension of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games this presents some significant challenges for the football club.<br /><br />Burnley FC are set to lose around £5 million in lost revenue from the remaining home games which in the event that the season finishes would be unlikely to be recouped owing to the likely prospect of these fixtures being played behind closed doors.<br /><br />In addition, the Clarets face missing out cash payments from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> of up to £45 million in broadcasting revenue and other items if the season is not finished. It is believed that other clubs could be looking at up to a £100m shortfall</p>

  <p><b>[White Live Matter, Burnley]</b> Burnley Football Club strongly condemns the actions of those responsible for the aircraft and offensive banner that flew over The <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a> on Monday evening.
