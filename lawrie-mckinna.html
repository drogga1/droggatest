  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets will explore an invitation to form a partnership with a club from Chile’s Primera Division that sees the A-League outfit as a bridge to the Chinese Super League]</b> Audax Italiano approached us through a match-agent based in Australia and are flying us over for discussions. It would be great to play against a top Chilean side. We will also talk about the potential for their players to come here to play for the Jets in the A-League and on-selling them to China. They want to talk about that and also getting a Chinese player to play in Chile to open up the market for them.<br /><br />There is a big Chile population in Sydney. Obviously it will attract Jets fans. When you bring out an English Premier League club you are talking about seven figures to underwrite it. This is not like that. It is an opportunity for us to play a top Chilean team</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets CEO Lawrie McKinna has revealed the A-League cellar-dwellers have made informal enquiries about signing Perth Glory’s Diego Castro]</b> If we’re going to do better we have to try to get players like a Castro. It’s just an informal thing at this stage. It wasn’t Castro’s actual agent we spoke to, but sometimes there is more than one person involved in a process like this and it’s someone we’re familiar with in this case. We gave him authority to ask questions on our behalf. It happens all the time in the UK. Now we’re just sitting back and reflecting and we’re going to get this weekend out of the way and see where we go after that. We have to get a final budget from the owner, weigh things up and decide if we can press for a player like him.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets will face Audax Italiano in a pre-season friendly at McDonald Jones Stadium in July as part of a new partnership between the two clubs]</b> Audax Italiano may not be a household name in Australia, however, they are a very competitive and financially sustainable club playing in a challenging 16-team league, so this represents an unique opportunity for us to be exposed to and interact with a club that we would not otherwise encounter.<br /><br />This match will take place at the end of the second week of our pre-season and will most likely provide our members and fans with their first opportunity to witness our new recruits in the flesh against a quality opponent. There are approximately 50,000 Chilean-Australians living in Australia, and roughly 25 per cent of those people reside in and around Sydney</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets-Audax Italiano friendly cancelled]</b> Club staff have worked diligently to assist the match promoter leading into what would have been a unique international friendly for our club, team, members and fans. Nevertheless, factors outside of our control mean that Audax Italiano will no longer travel to Australia next month. All fans that have purchased a ticket to the match will be refunded in full. We apologise to our members and fans who, like us, were looking forward to this fixture early in our 2017 pre-season.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets’ efforts to sign star striker Roy O’Donovan have failed]</b> We made a number of generous offers to Roy and his management. Talks began <b>[about re-signing]</b> midway through the season, with serious discussions beginning about two months ago. As <b>[coach]</b> Ernie <b>[Merrick]</b>, <b>[operations manager]</b> Joel <b>[Grifftihs]</b> and myself said from the beginning we wanted to keep Roy and did everything within reason to extend his stay in Newcastle. We were close on a number of occasions, but unfortunately from our perspective the goal posts continued to shift. It was disappointing from as the club has stood by and supported him through some difficult circumstances</p>

  <p><b>[Lawrie McKinna tells about the club’s decision to grant indefinite leave to winger Joey Champness so he can pursue a career in hip hop in Los Angeles]</b> We allowed Joey to head to the United States to pursue a dream in music at the start of last month. He’s made inroads in the business and the opportunity to remain in LA to chase those dreams is one that’s too big for him to pass up</p>
