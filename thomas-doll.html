  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> boss Doll reflects on the time <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> took his job: It wasn’t pleasant to hear before a cup final]</b> It is not pleasant to hear something like that just before such an important game, but nobody from the club contacted me about it. Aki <a href="hans-joachim-watzke.html">Watzke</a> (Dortmund’s CEO) and I only sat down after the season and decided that a fresh start would be best for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>. My focus is always on the here and now and you could see in the final that the whole team was at the top. Unfortunately we lost 2-1 in extra time, otherwise it would have been a nice reward after all the bad games in the Bundesliga<br /><br />We had a few young players with great potential. <a href="mats-hummels.html">Mats Hummels</a> for example. At that time, many would not have believed that he would have such a global career. I can still remember when we watched an Under-23 game from him at Bayern before signing him. <a href="hermann-gerland.html">Herrmann Gerland</a> <b>[Bayern’s reserves coach]</b> then tested him in defensive midfield. He liked to put central defenders a little bit further up from time to time because it is more unusual for these players to stand with their backs to the opponent. It was very interesting to see. Mats did a good job, but he was just very young and just not that far along physically. When he came to us in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he had two old hands <b>[ahead of him]</b> in Christian Worns and <a href="robert-kovac.html">Robert Kovac</a>. So, it was not easy for him, but he remained patient and has become one of the best central defenders in the world. I take my hat off<br /><br /><b>[Despite Doll’s time at the club being followed by a true <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> golden era under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, he sticks by his own achievements in helping to lay the foundations]</b> I’ll stick with the positive. One should not forget: When I came to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in March 2007, the club was close to relegation. It was almost done, internally there was doom and gloom. We had nine games to get the job done and I’m glad we did it</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga restart backed to succeed by former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> boss Thomas Doll]</b> I am more than ready for the restart. Everybody who loves football must have been missing it really bad - even if we know that there are a lot of topics, which are even more important than football. I also talked to a lot of guys, everybody is happy about the restart. There is a difference between an arena with spectators and an empty one, but I think everybody is aware of the fact, that there is no other possibility right now<br /><br />I think the restart can succeed, if everybody is acting according to this brilliant concept of the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a>, which is not that easy to handle. If everybody sticks to this it can work out. We already saw a lot of tests, to I think about 2,000 persons only in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Cologne were affected already, unfortunately now it is Dynamo Dresden and Hannover. That’s too bad, because you don’t want to be behind the other teams<br /><br />There was no other possibility to protect the club. The decision was not only made by <b>[head coach]</b> Bruno Labbadia, the whole club decided to suspend Kalou. By now Kalou realises his mistake. But that’s no excuse for his failure. He is not 18 anymore, so at his age you should be a little bit smarter. He already had paid his price for that. He put Hertha in a very bad situation, so they only had the option to pull the ripcord</p>
