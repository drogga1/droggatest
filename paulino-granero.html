  <p>[Russia’s fitness coach Paulino Granero is baffled why people are surprised by the host nation’s impressive running statistics at the World Cup] I don’t know why people are so impressed. Russia, in the last two years, in all their friendly matches, they are reaching the same distance, the same total distance and high-intensity distances. It was even better than now. Look at us against Brazil, Argentina and Spain [in the friendlies]. Russia has shown amazing fitness in past games but even now it is a little worse than in September, October and November. I am surprised that people are surprised. We will see what happens in the next match. The boys are training very hard. Our two weeks in Austria prepared each player for their individual capacity and that’s it. They are running 13km more than Saudi Arabia. Spain are running 103km and Russia at 115km. It is different, our players are very, very strong and Spain has more technical players, for example, more control over the ball, they keep the ball longer, tactically they are different.<br /><br />I invite you to come one day to see how he is training day by day, in the pitch and you will see a big surprise at how he is training every day. He is one of the best, most professional trainers that I have seen in my life. Absolutely. He is a very strong player and he has done it for his whole career</p>

  <p>[Why former Football Manager wonderkid Igor Akinfeev never became a superstar] Igor Akinfeev is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. He is a good professional, just like Sergei Ignashevich, Mario Fernandes, Alan Dzagoev and Alexandr Golovin. They are all good, good professionals. They train very hard every day. They take care of the small aspects like drinking, eating and sleeping. Everything. They control every aspect of their lives.<br /><br />Of course, of course [Russians are good enough to play in the top five leagues]. They need to try out other competitions. They need to know other competitions and I invite them to play in England and Spain because they have the capacity to play there</p>
