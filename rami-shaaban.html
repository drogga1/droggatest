  <p><b>[Rami Shaaban and the accident that changed his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> career]</b> There was suddenly this big bang. It sounded like a shin pad had broken or something.<br /><br />It was <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a>. It’s not surprising maybe that it was him, but he was on my team. It was just a freak accident. Dennis <b>[<a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a>]</b> tried to lob me, I went backwards and tipped the ball onto the underside of the bar and as I was on the ground, I tried to kick it away with my foot and at the same time Martin tried to clear it, but he cleared my leg instead. I didn’t feel any instant pain and I saw Martin strolling around, so I thought to myself, what was that? Then after a few seconds I started to feel my whole leg go numb, like when you sleep on your arm. Then I saw my players running to me and I saw their faces, they all went pale because they could see my leg was totally disconnected. I remember my mum was in London because we were going to celebrate Christmas that day. I called her from the ambulance and told her I had broken my leg and she thought I was joking. I had to tell her like 10 times.<br /><br />The season in Sweden starts in April and goes through to November. I was on the bench until the middle of July. But our first choice keeper was in the 2002 World Cup squad and when he came back he wasn’t in good shape, so the manager put me in and from there it all took off. Remember we are talking about mid-July and just over a month later I had signed for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. That shows how fast things happen sometimes<br /><br /><b>[He then returned to Sweden to await <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s decision]</b> A few days later my lawyer called and said it was between me and the Argentinian keeper, Carlos Roa. We were in the last week of the transfer window and that was the hardest week of my career. One day it seemed like it would be a deal, then the next day the deal was off because <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> didn’t want to pay what my club was asking for. It went back and forth and then finally they agreed. I even had to give up some money to my Swedish team as well because my contract said I would get 10 per cent, but they said I had to give it up if there was going to be a deal.<br /><br />The game was hostile, but it was more hostile in the stands than on the pitch. I went onto the pitch knowing that it would be a game I would always remember. I just wanted to enjoy it, I felt so privileged to get the chance to play. Even in the tunnel, it felt like we had almost won the game before it started. We were so high on confidence and it felt like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were weak at the knees - you could almost touch the feeling in the air. Then we started well, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> scored that goal and we won easily<br /><br /><b>[<a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a> had left and <a href="bob-wilson.html">Bob Wilson</a> had retired, with <a href="jens-lehmann.html">Jens Lehmann</a> coming in as No.1 and Gerry Peyton appointed goalkeeper coach]</b> You can’t imagine how different it was. Jens was so competitive and there’s nothing wrong with being competitive. I didn’t mind that and Jens was fair as well. When he got angry, it didn’t matter if it was a youth player or <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a> - they got something. He was very honest and I liked that about him. If he thought something was wrong, you heard it. And you heard it very well! You had to cope with it and I didn’t take it personally because he was like that with everyone. So it was nothing against me, but it was night and day comparing David and Bob to Jens and Gerry<br /><br />The only thing I had a problem with is that as a goalkeeping coach, your goal is to keep everyone happy and have a good atmosphere and I think that was what let Gerry down a bit. His training was really good, but when it came to people, he wasn’t that good. That’s where I had a problem. That was the only hard part that season<br /><br />My time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is up there with the World Cup game I had. The clean sheet on my debut, the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game, winning in Rome in the Champions League. And even though I didn’t play a single minute in the Invincibles season, I was still on the bench and involved. Those are memories that will be with me my whole life</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Rami Shaaban has offered a fascinating insight into the key ingredients which made <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s Invincibles so exceptional during the 2003-04 campaign]</b> We were a group that gelled so well together. So even when the tension was high, you had people like Vieira who could be easy going and you had Ray who could pull out a joke when the time was right. But then they would switch on as well. I said Vieira, because when there was a game, Patrick was totally different. The presence of Patrick was so important for every one of us. But to have someone like Parlour - and <a href="sylvain-wiltord.html">Sylvan Wiltord</a> as well - it was such a great mix. You need to have those players to let down the tension sometimes. Arsene wasn’t demanding, he just put so much belief in us. Even me. I wasn’t playing, but I still felt like I was one of the most important players in the squad. He put that confidence in every single player, everyone accepted their role in the team and I think that was the biggest task, to keep everyone happy when you had a squad like we had<br /><br /><a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> was amazing, he won a lot of games for us. But we had <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> as well, the cleverest player I ever played with. I don’t think <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> would have been the player he was if we didn’t have Dennis in the team. A lot of people say, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>. But when Dennis was on the pitch, he saw things that no-one else saw. His passes, everything, he was just a magician<br /><br />I don’t think going unbeaten was in our mindset at the beginning. Winning the league was the first priority because we lost it very badly the year before. I actually think we played better football the first year I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> even though we didn’t win, but we built something that year character-wise which allowed us to be invincible the second year. I don’t think we would have come back to win that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game, especially after losing against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, if we hadn’t built that character from the season before. We were one year older.<br /><br />We all believed we could do it <b>[go unbeaten]</b>, but we didn’t talk about it until the very end. Even when we did it, we didn’t really know what it would mean. If you look now, 15 years afterwards, people still talk about it every season. Even I do it. I sat there in January watching <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> thinking ‘bloody hell, when will that first loss come’. It was the same last season. When City beat them I was so happy. It does mean a lot.</p>
