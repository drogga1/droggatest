  <p><b>[After a decade away Brazil international Diego Alves came home this week, putting pen to paper on a switch to Flamengo in his native Rio de Janeiro]</b> Right now, I am thinking only about my life at Flamengo. I believe that the national team is a reward for the form a player shows at his club. I am going to work hard to earn a call-up for Flamengo first. I came to Flamengo thinking only about Flamengo.<br /><br />Of course, we are solving the administrative tasks, the papers that need to be exchanged, but I have been training over my summer holiday. I had about 10 or 15 days that I stopped to rest, because we are not machines, but other than that I was always training. I want to be on the field, but I need to train, meet the coach, and talk to everyone. Even though we are now in the middle of the season, with important games to come… You can be sure that I will train hard and make myself available as quickly as possible<br /><br />Alex Muralha and I have known each other since has known me since he was in the Commercial, I never trained with him, but I’ve always been close to him, he’s a very valuable goalkeeper<br /><br />I think Brazilian football has improved a lot, that is illustrated in the willingness of players to return. Regarding Flamengo, there is a lot of ground ahead of us, but it’s a big club. <b>[Winning titles]</b> is the goal for the players and everyone at the club. I believe we have a great chance of having a great amount of joy</p>
