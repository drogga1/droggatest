  <p><b>[Manchester United, Liverpool, Inter and Juventus have been warned by Lazio that they face frustration in the ongoing pursuit of Stefan de Vrij]</b> are on the right track and have to decide together. I hope his journey will continue with us. It is something he wants too, because he is very fond of this place and the club. He has many offers from top level clubs, obviously, but his heart beats for Lazio and I hope in the end he’ll stay. It could be sorted out by tomorrow, as it’s not an issue of when, but what the deal will be.<br /><br />With the arrival of Martin Caceres, the Lazio squad is more than complete. Luis Alberto has a long contract, but we’ll soon meet with his agents to reconsider it, because he has proved to be an important player</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio have reached complete agreement with Stefan de Vrij over a new contract]</b> I prefer not to talk about this tonight, there will be a communiqué soon to that effect. It’s more in than out though. There is complete agreement with the player, the problem is with his agency but these are bureaucratic matters. It’s a never-ending story but we’ll decide soon.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan de Vrij will not be returning to Lazio after his contract expires this summer]</b> Lazio have withdrawn the proposal we made for a new contract to De Vrij. We are withdrawing for reasons that we will explain later on. It was a choice made after many months of negotiations, but there is also a limit to how things went.<br /><br />He has been an exemplary professional and we thank him for that. He gave a lot to the club, just as we gave a great deal to him, but our paths will divide in June. It’s not an issue of him agreeing terms with other clubs, but of being fair in negotiations. We did things the right way, but things changed at the last moment. We no longer wish to continue along this path</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United and Real Madrid have been made aware it will take more than €70 million to land Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic]</b> Over the summer we received, and rejected, an offer worth €70m for Milinkovic-Savic. We want to make Lazio a point of arrival for players rather than a stepping stone to bigger clubs. We have a lot of work to do, but that is our objective. The team was built to achieve certain objectives and from now until the end of the season, there will be no more transfer market distractions. Rumours in the media are part of the profession and you must learn to live with them. We want to win the Coppa Italia and qualify for the Champions League. We won’t snub the Europa League, but the principle target must be a top four finish in Serie A.</p>

  <p><b>[Milinkovic-Savic worth over €90m]</b> I don’t know how much he could be worth and I don’t even want to think about it. It’s certainly a figure well over €80-90m, in any case. Sergej is very important to us and has not yet reached his peak. There are always more players who can be found and developed.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan de Vrij rejected the offer of a new contract with the Biancocelesti]</b> We’ll explain our reasons later. There’s a limit and that’s been breached, and it’s not become a question of correctness. He’s always been an exceptional professional and he’s given a lot to Lazio, and Lazio has given a lot to him, but at the end of the season, our paths will divide.</p>

  <p><b>[Cancelling <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season due to coronavirus would be a disaster]</b> The season must be completed. The championship must go on out of respect for the dead and all the fans. The time is not yet ripe to decide on the cancellation. The number of infected people is decreasing and interrupting the season would be unfair.<br /><br />For Italian football, stopping here would be a disaster. We will try to prevent this from happening with all our strength. In Italian football over 75% of clubs finance their budget through TV rights, if these revenues were not there, it would come to collapse<br /><br />We would like to return to normal and this also means training. The players do not wait for anything else, they only wait for the moment when everything can return to normal within the club. At that point, we will have to slowly regain shape and get out of this horrible moment as soon as possible</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> sporting director Igli Tare says the Italian government has no right to order the football season to be cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I heard that the order could come from the Minister of Sport this week. But that would not be within his remit. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> have explained that the leagues must be finished within the calendar year. If we don’t start the league again in June, we will do it when it’s possible. I’m also talking about August and September and taking advantage of the fact that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be in December. I think finishing the season would be a great experience for the next one<br /><br /><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> will begin testing their players for Covid-19 when they return to the training ground this week, says Tare, who says he is proud of his club’s response to the pandemic]</b> We will start again on Wednesday, but as soon as we start the tests we will understand if we can bring forward this date for the resumption. <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> was the first club to stop playing and training for this pandemic. We were among the few teams in Italy to comply with every government order from start to finish. No player left the city. We appeared to be aggressive in our communication for a simple reason: we have analysed how much football, as the third largest industry in the country, faces serious damage. It was very important for the players to receive signs of progress. When we heard that we would return to training we celebrated in the chat.</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting director Igli Tare said <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Sergej Milinkovic-Savic</a> will not be available at a reduced rate due to the coronavirus pandemic]</b> We certainly don’t need to sell right now. I think a lot will change on the transfer market, because the pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence that transformed everything, so we have to be creative, but above all very clear on our planning for the present and future. I think that prices won’t drop for first-rate players. Obviously for the medium and low-end players, there will be a downward trend. On <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Milinkovic-Savic</a>, the boy’s relationship with the city and <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> will never die because there is a very strong bond that has grown over years. On the other hand, considering the situation, his wishes, everything we’ve talked about, every situation will be evaluated at the right time without any pressure, but above all for the good of both parties. If there is a possibility that satisfies the club and the player, it will be taken into consideration. If there is not, he is happy and we are very happy for him to stay<br /><br />We will shortly be announcing a new signing, Escalante from <a href="eibar.html">Eibar</a>. He is a player who has the right experience but above all the right characteristics to play for Lazio</p>
