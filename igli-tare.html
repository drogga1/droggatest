  <p><b>[Cancelling <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season due to coronavirus would be a disaster]</b> The season must be completed. The championship must go on out of respect for the dead and all the fans. The time is not yet ripe to decide on the cancellation. The number of infected people is decreasing and interrupting the season would be unfair.<br /><br />For Italian football, stopping here would be a disaster. We will try to prevent this from happening with all our strength. In Italian football over 75% of clubs finance their budget through TV rights, if these revenues were not there, it would come to collapse<br /><br />We would like to return to normal and this also means training. The players do not wait for anything else, they only wait for the moment when everything can return to normal within the club. At that point, we will have to slowly regain shape and get out of this horrible moment as soon as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio sporting director Igli Tare says the Italian government has no right to order the football season to be cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I heard that the order could come from the Minister of Sport this week. But that would not be within his remit. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> have explained that the leagues must be finished within the calendar year. If we don’t start the league again in June, we will do it when it’s possible. I’m also talking about August and September and taking advantage of the fact that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be in December. I think finishing the season would be a great experience for the next one<br /><br /><b>[Lazio will begin testing their players for Covid-19 when they return to the training ground this week, says Tare, who says he is proud of his club’s response to the pandemic]</b> We will start again on Wednesday, but as soon as we start the tests we will understand if we can bring forward this date for the resumption. Lazio was the first club to stop playing and training for this pandemic. We were among the few teams in Italy to comply with every government order from start to finish. No player left the city. We appeared to be aggressive in our communication for a simple reason: we have analysed how much football, as the third largest industry in the country, faces serious damage. It was very important for the players to receive signs of progress. When we heard that we would return to training we celebrated in the chat.</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting director Igli Tare said <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Sergej Milinkovic-Savic</a> will not be available at a reduced rate due to the coronavirus pandemic]</b> We certainly don’t need to sell right now. I think a lot will change on the transfer market, because the pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence that transformed everything, so we have to be creative, but above all very clear on our planning for the present and future. I think that prices won’t drop for first-rate players. Obviously for the medium and low-end players, there will be a downward trend. On <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Milinkovic-Savic</a>, the boy’s relationship with the city and Lazio will never die because there is a very strong bond that has grown over years. On the other hand, considering the situation, his wishes, everything we’ve talked about, every situation will be evaluated at the right time without any pressure, but above all for the good of both parties. If there is a possibility that satisfies the club and the player, it will be taken into consideration. If there is not, he is happy and we are very happy for him to stay<br /><br />We will shortly be announcing a new signing, Escalante from Eibar. He is a player who has the right experience but above all the right characteristics to play for Lazio</p>
