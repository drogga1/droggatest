  <p><b>[Lyon spring 16/1 shock by beating Champions League favourites Manchester City]</b> The Champions League kicked off with quite a few predictable results but having said that, Manchester City’s defeat was the single best result we could have hoped for in this opening week of fixtures</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho cut to 6/4 as Pogba rift continues]</b> Mourinho’s odds have come in from 6/1, spent a bit of time at 3/1, however that price has been hammered as well and he is now in to 6/4. No doubt the majority of wagers have come off the back of the results against Wolves and Derby but there must surely have been a bit of cash from Paul Pogba sympathisers</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham 5000/1 to win the title next season after Claudio Ranieri appointment]</b> Fulham fans will be hoping that Ranieri can steer them to safety this season but given what happened at Leicester a couple of years back, there may be a few that are starting to dream</p>

A gamble like this often suggests something</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United biggest price in 25 years ahead of derby clash at Old Trafford]</b> The prices for Wednesday’s match are not just a reflection of how good Manchester City are but an indictment of Manchester United’s season. Not even against Bayern Munich under David Moyes were United this big a price to win at Old Trafford</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> the second biggest price ever to win a Premier League match]</b> It is rather indicative of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the Premier League that the three biggest prices ever offered have been within the last two seasons, and the two biggest have come within the last month. It is expected that Liverpool will win on Friday and they will do so comfortably</p>
