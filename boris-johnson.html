  <p><b>[On Saturday night, Johnson signalled that he would again challenge the judiciary by introducing US-style political screening of supreme court judges before they are appointed. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, the prime minister said]</b> If judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup winner and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> legend Martin Peters has died aged 76]</b> Very sad news. No England fan will ever forget the heroics of Martin Peters and his fantastic team-mates. My sympathies go out to all of those who knew and loved him</p>

  <p><b>[What did Boris Johnson say during his coronavirus speech today?]</b> The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades - and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger…</p>

  <p><b>[Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus]</b> I’m working from home and self-isolating and that’s entirely the right thing to do. But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus</p>
