  <p><b>[Mexico national team member Jesus Gallardo joins Rayados from Pumas]</b> First of all, I’m really happy to come into a situation like Rayados and also to have a place in the World Cup. I’m excited for the World Cup. It’s something that every footballer dreams of</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico is enjoying its 1-0 victory over Germany in the first Group F match of the 2018 World Cup]</b> I think so. Today was a great game. We were able to dream and believe in ourselves and beat the champion of the world.</p>

  <p><b>[Jesus Gallardo turning in a tremendous performance to help El Tri to a 1-0 victory over the reigning champion Germany]</b> I had a lot of contrasting feelings. There was pride, excitement. I think I was really happy and just excited.<br /><br />I’ve always said I’m with Osorio to the death. I’m really thankful to Osorio because of the chances he’s given me in the national team and the confidence he has in me, and I have in him. I’m really confident and what I can do for him is to give 100 percent in the games. I never expected I’d have that kind of confidence, but he’s believed in me, and I’m trying to respond to that on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Rayados’ finally-fit attackers could be key in Liga MX playoffs]</b> I’m with the manager until the end. He works really well and pushes all the players. Support him, be at 100 percent and you have to take advantage of the guys who are on the field. If you get on there, give it everything.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> finds ideal fullbacks for his system in Jesus Gallardo and Luis Rodriguez]</b> Honestly, it’s really good. I think we have to get into the attack a lot, which is good for me. I like to play as a winger and as a fullback and arrive from the back by surprise. We do the movements needed for the fullbacks to be free and be able to attack more easily</p>

  <p><b>[For the first time in the <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> era, El Tri played a team from the top echelon on the world stage, and for the first time in the Martino era, Mexico lost, falling 4-0 to Argentina here Tuesday night]</b> Unfortunately the errors we made put us under water. We’ve got to keep working, working every day, listen to Tata and get better. But I think it’s just a game. We’ll keep working, work on our style of play. I don’t think that’s where the issue was. I think it was the mistake we made that decided the game</p>
