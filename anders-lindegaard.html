  <p><b>[Anders Lindegaard on <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> as a manager]</b> His last speech before the team went on the pitch before the match against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> was spine-tingling in a way that I have only experienced from Sir Alex. It probably sounds rather naive and impetuous, and I understand people’s scepticism about any conclusion drawn from the results of four workouts, a game and a day off, but to me we are dealing with a new Guardiola</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard has praised <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> for overcoming a rocky start to life at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and become one of the world’s best]</b> He got way too much grief in the beginning on the crosses part of his game. He wasn’t as dodgy as people made him out to be. He just had to adjust his decision making to English football and grow a few kilos. David has been a world class goalkeeper since he arrived in England, my first impression of him was he was young, but a huge talent. Much bigger talent than I ever was. I think the biggest hurdle he had to overcome was to win respect from team mates, media and fans. He struggled in the beginning. But his mental strength to overcome the difficult periods is what has impressed me the most. From where he was at the worst in his first season to where he took it and is today - that shows huge character and mental strength.<br /><br /><b>[Lindegaard, now plying his trade at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>, lost the battle for the starting spot at United due to an ankle injury]</b> I clearly remember a turning point. The first game he played after my ankle injury was against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> away. Last minute free kick just outside the box. <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> took it and shaped the ball perfectly over the wall towards the near top corner. David saved it and the match ended 3-3. Breaking the save down it wasn’t as good as it looked but David gambled on that corner and won. If he had lost, the media and fans would have been ready to lynch him. Instead he became a sensation after that moment</p>

  <p><b>[Anders Lindegaard talks about <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s troubled transition from <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> in the summer of 2013]</b> I didn’t feel it was ageing. It felt more like we just couldn’t adjust to a new way of life. It seemed like trying to charge an iPhone with a Nokia charger. It just slowly went flat. Who was ever going to lift the club after the boss <b>[Ferguson]</b>? <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> and everyone with big influence on United have all been easy targets. And I refuse to be another one pointing at individuals. Every time the team has had a single bad result I’ve heard suggestions for new managers, getting rid of half the team and signing new players. I imagine it isn’t easy to work under those circumstances. I’ll point at myself and everyone else involved with United. Both on a professional and an emotional level. We were all to blame. None of us could accept changes to our beloved United. All of us thought everything should just stay the same and we’d carry on succeeding. It was an illusion.<br /><br />It seems to me like the club needed change and modernisation. And I can imagine it’s been hard for the club to realise that. United is tradition and history. Tradition and history is hard to change. Especially when it’s as long and successful as United. A modern football club needs a philosophy that’s defined by the club - not the manager. In terms of football you need to have a clear idea what a United player and a United team is. That responsibility should be on the club - not the manager. Otherwise you end up buying a new team every time you change the manager. Maybe the club did have a clear strategy and philosophy on football. But looking at it from the outside it hasn’t been clear<br /><br /><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> may be the man to get United back on track]</b> I think he is. I deeply hope so. United’s history is so rich and successful. And I think the club and the fans need someone who speaks to the history. Someone who understands it and complies with it. I don’t doubt Ole has come in to carry on the United heritage and stay true to the United DNA. And he can do that because he knows it and is a part of it himself. But there’s a crucial ingredient I’m afraid will be difficult to accept. And that’s time. Realistically it will take years to rebuild United for greatness. Look at how long it took <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. For Ole to be successful in the long term I think everyone will have to embrace themselves with patience and accept the current state. There’s a massive job ahead of him and no matter how you twist and turn it I think his success depends on how well the club helps him. Especially on recruitment</p>
