<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Football distracted me from accepting I’m gay]</b> It’s still something that people look at and think, ‘why don’t they just do it? I don’t know why they’re talking about it’. But the perspective is different for a gay athlete. There are so many mental obstacles you go around, trying to figure out these things from the inside. It feels very different to how it probably looks on the outside<br /><br /><b>[He described the confusion he felt as a teenager]</b> I was struggling, but I couldn’t articulate why… I wanted to be as far away as I could. I understood I was different from the rest of my friends, but I never really could pinpoint what it was. I didn’t want to dive deeper and self-analyse that, because that process was pretty daunting to even consider<br /><br /><b>[The game became the perfect distraction]</b> When you’re playing and training, you’re in this zone of ‘nothing else matters’. You’re completely engulfed in what’s going on. It consumes you. The more I played, the more it allowed me to escape. But it was almost an anti-climax - you go from that euphoria to nothing, and then you get that ultimate sense of loneliness. It was a balancing act, trying to figure it all out. Is this helping me, or is it not? But football was all I knew, all I’ve ever loved. I’m still grateful for it now, but it left me in a position at times of feeling quite lonely<br /><br /><b>[The injury forced him to retire from playing, aged just 29]</b> It was a good time for me. I was in this space of knowing who I am but I was never really going to allow myself to accept it. The injury set me free, in that my perspective changed. It made me think that life is short, and tomorrow is not promised. For me to wait or live life on someone else’s terms was not going to be an option. It forced me into a space which now I’m very grateful for.	<br /><br /><b>[Upon recovery, Beattie stayed in Singapore and threw himself into the business world, becoming a digital entrepreneur]</b> It was definitely something that I could have done without. It was around that time that I started thinking this is not going to be a long-term thing for me. I thought, I can’t be living in this space. And I didn’t need to be either. I had no one else to answer to, so the only obstacle that was ahead of me was myself<br /><br /><b>[Singapore has always felt like home - even if LGBT+ rights are not yet as advanced there as in western nations]</b> It’s fairly open and accepting. There may not be equal marriage yet, but they’re not naïve to the fact that being gay isn’t a choice. <br /><br /><b>[coming out]</b> I started to get asked by certain people and I felt like I was coming out on a daily basis - it was really exhausting. I thought, I’d rather do this in one fell swoop, and find some purpose in it. Everyone’s journey’s different, but <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> was also in a very masculine physical sport - he went through the fire and came out doing OK. He’s someone whose story really resonated with me and offered some motivation for me to do the same<br /><br />I try to think of myself as not living in these two worlds anymore. They’ve just slowly blended together, and the people that matter to me are in both. I am a brother, son, friend and I’m gay. It took me a long time to accept who I am and I hope it is a little easier for the next generation</p>
