  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain Bradley-Auckland on coronavirus frontline]</b> It ended up with me losing my England contract and club contract so that’s when I made the decision to go into the care home to learn the manager’s role and work alongside my dad. Before that, I was always a carer, even when I was playing football, playing in the <b>[2012]</b> Olympics, I always went into the care home as well because I knew that would be something that I would go to work in after football. So it was always something that was in the back of my mind, but I guess when I had these injuries and the surgeon thought that I would never play football again, it became to me, ‘Now I’m coming to learn the role with my dad to work alongside him<br /><br />You’re protecting people away from harm of others and it’s a massive reward, making someone smile every day. For me, that makes the job. Sometimes it’s as little as painting their nails that means the world to them and puts that smile on their face. It’s also making them able to live their life to the full. A little bit of help and support in certain ways means that they’ll be able to do that and be happy. There are goals and things in life that they still have. A lot of them potentially have a goal to be able to walk again and that’s something that we help them with. It’s the most rewarding job that I’ve ever been a part of.<br /><br /><b>[As well as juggling football and work, the 30-year-old is also a mother to two-year-old Macie, who is already following in her mum’s footsteps by putting smiles on the faces of residents]</b> She just adds to the mayhem! I went back into the care home 10 days after I had Macie, so she’s got so many uncles, aunts, grandmas and grandads there. With everything that’s been going on, she’s not been going into the care home, so they’re all really missing her. I’m just taking photos and videos in so that they can still see her and watch her grow because they’ve seen her every day since she was 10 days old!<br /><br />You know when you have to go to school dressed up as different heroes? I always think, I wonder if Macie will go as me? But I wonder which job she’d choose to dress up as. She absolutely loves to come watch me play football, and she loves being at the care home. It’s amazing for her to be a part of it. She gets to mix with so many different people, every single day, and she’s getting to travel the world with my football as well as making the residents happy and smile. I don’t think she realises how much of an impact she has on their day-to-day life</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Women captain Sophie Bradley-Auckland halts career to work in care home]</b> I was only able to come and play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because I was able to continue with my role within the care home. Unfortunately with the current situation it’s made me have to make a decision, one that’s been awful and I’ve actually lost sleep about it. The fact is that I can’t return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> until a risk isn’t posed on the care home<br /><br />My happiness - and that’s what I call playing football, which is my happiness, is something that I love to do - isn’t worth somebody’s life and that is what it is as well. It is actually risking somebody’s life. I have a duty of care. I’ve got 24 residents, actually 24 other members of my family I would call them, and I would never want to pose any further risk on them than what’s already there<br /><br />I’m still a Red. I will be back at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but unfortunately at this moment in time it’s not possible for me to come, so I think it’s very much up in the air. All I’m holding onto is that I’ll be back. My training continues before I go to work and I’ll always be fit and ready to come back whenever that risk is not there on the care home</p>
