  <p><b>[Dimitri Payet express his disappointment at his fortunes]</b> Hello everyone. First of all I wanted to thank you for your messages and for your support, it touches me enormously. When you are a professional player, the France team is above all it’s true, but OM is in my heart and if it was necessary to do it again tomorrow, after tomorrow, in six months, in one year, I would do it without asking myself a single question.<br /><br />I repeat, I love this club and I am ready to make sacrifices for it if I can make it great again. I was fully aware of the risks I was taking and I fully assume the consequences. I am and I will be France’s greatest supporter for this World Cup. I will recover and start preparing next season. You can count on me. Go France and go OM!</p>

His temperature must be taken, quick! What’s the current league table? After 28 matches? Ah <b>[…]</b> OK, now I understand. It’s a good try! As games in both the PL and in the EFL are affected, the only fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void</p>

I could not give up. I never wanted to hear about being tired, quitting or old age. As long as all is well in my head, the legs will follow. And today, I’m a very happy person on and off the field. I will do everything to keep it going next year</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitri Payet was delighted after <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a> agrees to stay as <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> manager]</b> <b>[<a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a>]</b> had all the support from the locker room. A year ago, few of us would have seen us in second place in the standings with such a small squad. He did whatever it took to be rewarded for achieving this goal. It’s also great news for me because we had a good season together. He loves to have the ball, and I love the beautiful game<br /><br />The recent management of the coach shows OM have grown in crisis management. Beyond all that we have been able to say, we manage to talk to each other, to find solutions all together, to wash our dirty laundry with the family. Despite all that has been reported in recent days, he is still with us. He wants to continue the adventure. This is what counts today. When we say that OM is a family, it’s not just words. We really are together, without listening to outside opinions. We are united when it comes to the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitri Payet has signed a new deal with <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> - and has taken an unprecedented pay cut in order to do so]</b> I’ve often said that I love this club and that my family feels good here. The idea came into my head when the president said that the players should make an effort. And who better than me to lead by example? Saying you love the club is one thing, but showing it is better. I really want to be part of OM and help it grow</p>
