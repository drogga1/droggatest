I love an underdog but Patriots to win by 10.<br /><br />It’s got to be Francis Coquelin. Not because of his size, but because of his natural aggression and desire to win at all costs<br /><br />The Patriots have to win. I don’t know too much about Tom Brady but from what I’ve heard, he is a top player who can win the game for them. I think Harry Kane would probably be a team-mate that could make it in the NFL. He has great technique when striking the ball so there’s no reason why he couldn’t be a top place kicker</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi has branded Arsenal supporters calling for Arsene Wenger’s head as impatient and urged them to show the Frenchman more respect]</b> They need to have a bit more respect, in my opinion. I mean, he’s been at the club for 20 years, he’s achieved a lot, obviously they’re a bit impatient with the results and where they want to finish. We also want to finish there, we want to win the league like anyone else. I can guarantee we are trying our hardest. Whatever happens we are the players, we affect the result. We don’t really look at the banners or what fans are screaming, we focus on trying to do our jobs on the pitch.<br /><br />Honestly, I’m waiting as much as you guys are. I don’t know exactly what’s going on. But me, personally, I’d like him to stay. No matter who is in the job, or who gets the role, we’re always going to fight for the manager, every player always gives 100 per cent, no matter what, we’ll just play. He always backs our players and he is a great man. He’s been great to me as well, I’ll always back him, no matter what. For what he’s done for me, I’d like to say thank you, for bringing me into such a world-class team, and I’m playing almost regularly</p>

Maybe I can try to convince Arsenal to sign him - but I don’t think that’s going to happen<br /><br />Everyone could speak English, I’d get along fine, but they’d all say, ‘come on, you need to learn your language’.

He’s always achieved fourth place, been in the Champions League and been up there with the title contenders<br /><br /><b>[Iwobi is also looking for fresh terms to be thrashed out with star duo Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, who will be out of contract at the end of next season]</b> As you can see from stats, goals and chances they create they are key players in our team. Everything offensively almost goes through them. Even though we have other players they are world-class players. For the club it’d be great for them to stay, but at the end of the day it’s their decisions</p>

If I can overcome things that I believe were worse than what’s going on now, then surely I should be able to overcome this. It’s tough, especially for the ones who almost get released, which I unfortunately had to go through. It makes you stronger.

There won’t be a single player in our dressing room next season who will not fight for him. We’d run through brick walls for the boss. I’m pleased because he really is Mr Arsenal, isn’t he? He has made it the great institution it is today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he has not tasted a Premier League title since 2004, but look what he has achieved in his time here. Even last weekend, he became the manager who has won the FA Cup seven times - more than any other. I’m happy he’s staying - so are the rest of the lads - because it’s good for the club, good for the team</p>

As an Arsenal in the community coach now, I’m proud to be playing my part in that for the next generation. Meeting Dillon and the rest of the guys was a pleasure. They were just like how I was a few years ago, so it’s incredible to see that Arsenal can play a role in helping them to do well</p>

It’s making me feel a bit sharper, I’m doing things with a bit more intensity. It’s not just for me, though, I feel like I’m helping the team a lot more.<br /><br />It’s exciting times to be fair. Everybody’s enjoying and buying into the new ideas. For me personally, I’m enjoying the new sessions, the new training methods and the new ideas, so I’m enjoying my time with him. He demands a lot. He’s a lot more intense, a lot of high pressing and keeping the ball so that it benefits us if we have the ball. It’s good for us, especially the attackers who like to have the ball a lot<br /><br />Whenever something in the system changes, you have to prove yourself again. But wherever you go, you have to prove that you’re better than whoever else is on the team. At a team like Arsenal, that’s always going to be hard, so I always have to be on it in training and matches. I’ve got to be different. It’s going to be hard because we’ve got so many attackers and so many world-class players, so I’ve just got to prove that I’m on that level or as good as them so that I can be ahead of them, which is my aim</p>

  <p><b>[How Emery is rebuilding Iwobi’s confidence at Arsenal after Wenger stagnation]</b> I’m working every day in training. The main thing the boss stresses with me is to get into those positions to score. He’s happy with me getting into those positions and the next step is converting the chances. I’ve lost a bit of weight because of the intense training, and it’s made me a bit sharper.<br /><br />The boss basically told me that if something doesn’t work, just to keep going and don’t dwell on it. He’s told me to stop being so critical and to just keep trying no matter what happens, no matter if things don’t go as I want them to. That’s given me a lot more confidence to try a few more things, like beat a player, to shoot more. I’m always ready to get on the ball a bit more. I’m more positive and confident with the ball</p>

We analyse the games a bit more and we’re proving to the fans as well as ourselves that we’re able to compete for the title<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether a challenge for the crown can be maintained this season]</b> Well of course! But there’s a long way to go. It’s a marathon, so we just have to carry on being consistent.<br /><br />The manager has given me a lot of confidence, telling me that when I get the ball to just be positive. Whenever I am called upon to play, I always try to give my best and make sure that I can impose myself on the game</p>

He jokes around but always tells me I can do more - even last night, he was saying I can do more, he is always one of those guys. But he is always happy, always telling me and giving me the confidence to express myself, so it helps me. Mesut will come across as laid back but he is helping everyone in a different way and he helps me a lot.<br /><br />For me, he has just given me confidence to express myself. To believe in my ability, which I have been trying to show, and also in training, he is always letting me try new things, be positive, be direct and prove it in the game. It is working for me, so I just have to keep it going. I’d just say I am more confident. I feel that, even if I make a mistake, I am able to go again.

Maybe you think: ‘Football is not for you and you don’t want to play no more.’ But it’s good to have that self-motivation to believe you can prove your critics wrong. But I do play in a different position for Nigeria, as an attacking midfielder with a sense of freedom. I am more comfortable there. However, if I’m told to play on the left or the right, or left-back, like I have sometimes, I will always do my best</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi admitted that he would have to consider leaving his boyhood club if he believed he might struggle to get regular playing time]</b> I am not one to chicken out. I have had it all over the years, being told I’m not good enough. So whenever the chance comes I always try and prove I should be starting. Obviously my joy is to play football and not just sit out. If it comes to that I would have no choice but to leave. But I would always put up a fight to play - that is what I’ve done all my life</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> winger Alex Iwobi has said that he left <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> this summer in part because he had become too comfortable at the club]</b> I got a few phone calls <b>[about the deal]</b> and spoke to my agent. It took about a day of talking to the manager and talking to (Everton director of football) <a href="marcel-brands.html">Marcel Brands</a>. It wasn’t really hard and I got convinced. I was very comfortable <b>[at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> and I was on holiday so I didn’t think about any move. I got the call and thought about if this would be a better chance for me to improve myself as a player. I thought that this was a big opportunity and I shouldn’t turn it down. I’ve got no regrets about the decision<br /><br /><b>[Iwobi has taken well to life at Goodison Park, having scored two goals in three appearances thus far with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> It’s so far, so good, I feel like I’ve got a new home and I’m really comfortable here. I haven’t noticed much of a difference <b>[between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and London]</b> but the thing I struggle with is the accent here. When <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> was speaking to me at first, I had to listen and engage and I wasn’t sure what he had said so I just agreed. It’s adapting to that but apart from that, it’s almost the same as being in London. So far, I’ve been treated really well. It’s a family club and everyone treats you like family. Even though it’s different to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I’m enjoying it</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi says he can see clear similarities between <a href="everton-fc.html">Toffees</a> boss <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b> They are almost the same, thinking about it. They are both very patient, they are not men of many words but when they do say something there is a lot of wisdom. They are almost the same. They both like to play football; it is almost like I am working with the same man. It’s not like I’m back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> but it’s almost the same philosophy and I can buy into it easily and adapt to his plans straight away<br /><br />I’ve never been injured before and I’m thinking ‘why against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?’ and ‘why when there is a new manager watching?’. ‘What have I done to deserve this luck?’. But I took it on the chin and luckily I have good team-mates, we have good staff, good family around me. So I was able to forget about it quick and focus on getting back as soon as possible. It was a minor setback. Because I’d never had an injury before, I didn’t know what to do.<br /><br />Even when I injured myself in the game, I tried to continue, but that is the worst thing I could’ve done. Everyone has had an injury in their time, so when I got back in they were all telling me what I should do, how I should cope with it, don’t stress on trying to come back too quickly. It did help me and luckily, I was able to recover quicker than usual. I was told six weeks but I came back after four. Touch wood, it doesn’t happen again. I felt a pop in my hamstring and I thought I could play on but I couldn’t so it was weird but hopefully it won’t happen again</p>
