  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi on his decision to represent Nigeria instead of England at the international level]</b> The love Nigeria showed me, when I played for them in a friendly, the fans were just crazy. The fans almost eat you up because they love you so much. I’m enjoying playing for them</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi reacts to team-mate <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a>’s scorpion kick goal in the Gunners 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace in the English Premier League]</b> A lot of people were coming in at half-time with their mouths open like this <b>[does a jaw-dropping impression]</b>. They couldn’t believe it; they were all congratulating him, but it was only half-time. At the end of the game we could all say, ‘Well done, Ollie’. It’s so rare. We have some special players and you do see the odd crazy thing, but nothing like that has ever happened in training. We’ve had two now with <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a>. Don’t know who will be next. Those two goals were up there with the best I have ever seen</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi admits Unai Emery will be expecting Arsenal to secure a top-four finish and Champions League qualification in 2019-20]</b> Obviously we want to get back in to Champions League football. We haven’t spoken about where our targets are for next season, but I’m sure he’d <b>[Emery]</b> want to improve. The whole team would want to improve on the previous season we had and try to get to that Champions League. And, if not, win as many competitions, including the Europa League as well.<br /><br /><b>[The Nigeria international added, with reigning champions Manchester City once again being installed as firm favourites for the crown]</b> Everyone thought that last season, but Liverpool give them a tough challenge as well. So, you never know what could happen. I’m sure every club’s going to invest and try and get their team right. Pre-season’s coming up really soon, so everyone’s trying to get ready for the season to start. It’s hard to say right now whether Man City are going to dominate, but they could be favourites, considering they won it again</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi insists he has no intention of leaving Arsenal and welcomes the potential signings of Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Carrasco in his position]</b> I don’t have any idea of going anywhere else, I’m an Arsenal player. For a big club like Arsenal, you mentioned two great players so it will be exciting to have them. I don’t know anything that’s going on behind closed doors.<br /><br /><b>[Although they ultimately suffered a disappointing 4-1 defeat to Chelsea in Baku, Iwobi was pleased with the Gunners’ first season under Emery]</b> It was good, he demanded a lot from us. We enjoyed working under him but we marginally missed out of the Champions League and unfortunately, we were unable to get the result we needed in the Europa League final. You can see there is a big progression, everyone is enjoying it. We look forward to next season<br /><br /><b>[The Nigeria international made 35 Premier League appearances last season]</b> I was involved quite a lot last season. Obviously you want to start as many games as you can but it doesn’t work that way when you have a team like Arsenal, you just have to do well and whenever the opportunity comes, do your best. I just have to say thank you for the opportunity he is giving me. I’m happy to play anywhere <b>[for Arsenal]</b>, I’ll play wherever I’m told to play. I’ve always seen myself as a midfielder, like an attacking midfielder but I’ll always give my best whether I’m told to play in the middle or somewhere else<br /><br /><b>[Iwobi is confident that the north Londoners are capable of producing a strong campaign]</b> On a good day, we’re able to beat any team as we showed last season. I think it’s more of a mental thing, make sure we are mentally ready for every game and we will be able to do well</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal star Alex Iwobi has spoken glowingly of his energetic and demanding boss Unai Emery]</b> If Arsene spoke to you, he speaks with you, with a lot of wisdom and a lot of experience over the years and from the great players he trained. Every time I spoke with him I left with knowledge and experience. He helped me a lot to be the man I am now. He trained a lot of players during his career so I have to make use of all this experience he gave to me to be the player that I am now. Emery is more energetic and also demanding; he always speaking with you and trying to help you. I think this is because of his age, Emery is much younger. I think Arsene was like that when he was the same age.<br /><br />Both want to play football and help me to grow and play better. As a player I progressed more with more goals and assists this year so I improved hopefully. I could score and assist more in the future. <b>[Emery]</b> talked with me a lot to be more composed to shoot and cross more and this helped me in the tournament to score goals and create more chances<br /><br /><b>[Iwobi is in no doubt that he and his Arsenal team-mates must toughen up in order not to let such opportunities slip through their fingers]</b> Consistency, We need to play in the same level in all games. We have good quality players and coach so we have to focus more and increase our level. Our mentality in big games is the thing we need to work on to compete with other good teams. Liverpool could have won the Premier League but Man City did it last season so we are going to face another hard and tough season. I am concerned more about Arsenal doing better and being in the top four and back in the Champions League. This is the most important thing for us because two seasons away from the Champions league is something we do not want to face again</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal wide-man Alex Iwobi claims he may be forced to quit the club if they fulfill their ambition of signing Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace]</b> I am not one to chicken out. I have had it all over the years, being told I’m not good enough. So whenever the chance comes I always try and prove I should be starting. But it’s going to be difficult if Zaha comes. He will add more stress. Obviously my joy is to play football and not just sit out. If it comes to that I would have no choice but to leave. But I would always put up a fight to play - that is what I’ve done all my life<br /><br /><b>[Along with Zaha, pressure has been placed on Iwobi by the promotion of Reiss Nelson to the first-team by manager Unai Emery]</b> I was still at school when I was hearing <b>[I wouldn’t make it at Arsenal]</b>. Maybe you think: ‘Football is not for you and you don’t want to play no more.’ But it’s good to have that self-motivation to believe you can prove your critics wrong. But I do play in a different position for Nigeria, as an attacking midfielder with a sense of freedom. I am more comfortable there. However, if I’m told to play on the left or the right, or left-back, like I have sometimes, I will always do my best</p>

  <p><b>[Everton winger Alex Iwobi has said that he left <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> this summer in part because he had become too comfortable at the club]</b> I got a few phone calls <b>[about the deal]</b> and spoke to my agent. It took about a day of talking to the manager and talking to (Everton director of football) <a href="marcel-brands.html">Marcel Brands</a>. It wasn’t really hard and I got convinced. I was very comfortable <b>[at Arsenal]</b> and I was on holiday so I didn’t think about any move. I got the call and thought about if this would be a better chance for me to improve myself as a player. I thought that this was a big opportunity and I shouldn’t turn it down. I’ve got no regrets about the decision<br /><br /><b>[Iwobi has taken well to life at Goodison Park, having scored two goals in three appearances thus far with Everton]</b> It’s so far, so good, I feel like I’ve got a new home and I’m really comfortable here. I haven’t noticed much of a difference <b>[between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and London]</b> but the thing I struggle with is the accent here. When <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> was speaking to me at first, I had to listen and engage and I wasn’t sure what he had said so I just agreed. It’s adapting to that but apart from that, it’s almost the same as being in London. So far, I’ve been treated really well. It’s a family club and everyone treats you like family. Even though it’s different to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I’m enjoying it</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi says he can see clear similarities between Toffees boss <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager Arsene Wenger]</b> They are almost the same, thinking about it. They are both very patient, they are not men of many words but when they do say something there is a lot of wisdom. They are almost the same. They both like to play football; it is almost like I am working with the same man. It’s not like I’m back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> but it’s almost the same philosophy and I can buy into it easily and adapt to his plans straight away<br /><br />I’ve never been injured before and I’m thinking ‘why against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?’ and ‘why when there is a new manager watching?’. ‘What have I done to deserve this luck?’. But I took it on the chin and luckily I have good team-mates, we have good staff, good family around me. So I was able to forget about it quick and focus on getting back as soon as possible. It was a minor setback. Because I’d never had an injury before, I didn’t know what to do.<br /><br />Even when I injured myself in the game, I tried to continue, but that is the worst thing I could’ve done. Everyone has had an injury in their time, so when I got back in they were all telling me what I should do, how I should cope with it, don’t stress on trying to come back too quickly. It did help me and luckily, I was able to recover quicker than usual. I was told six weeks but I came back after four. Touch wood, it doesn’t happen again. I felt a pop in my hamstring and I thought I could play on but I couldn’t so it was weird but hopefully it won’t happen again</p>
