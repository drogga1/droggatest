  <p><b>[Djibril Sidibe believes sealing top spot with a group fixture still to play is testament to Monaco’s attacking philosophy]</b> I’m always happy to put in a good display. We saw how good the spirit is within the team tonight. The most important thing is that we’ve qualified and what shines through is that we’ve got a team that wants to play attacking football, something we proved again in this match as we attacked from the off.<br /><br />We stayed focused and we knew that sooner or later we’d get chances and we stuck them away. It’s great that we’re going through as group winners and that’s something we’re going to savour before thinking about our future ambitions in this competition</p>

  <p><b>[Djibril Sidibe says that he would consider a summer move to Arsenal or Barcelona]</b> The risk is going to going to a big club to be a replacement, to go backwards and to be loaned away - it’s complicated. My criteria, it’s playing time. After that, if a club I could not refuse guaranteed me time to play, I would have to think. Every player wants to play against the best in the best leagues. Today, I’m lucky to play with Monaco in a good team. We’re in the Champions League, we’re scoring lots of goals and we’re still capable of winning every competition. I’m very happy at Monaco.</p>

  <p><b>[Sidibe even rejected the chance to move to Arsenal due to Monaco’s approach]</b> I was really just an inch away from signing. Normally, you jump right at the chance but, after reflection, I didn’t think my game time would be guaranteed. I would have played 25 matches this season, including cups.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco full-back Djibril Sidibe believes Ligue 1 champions Monaco will continue to flourish next season]</b> Leonardo has been building something here for a few years now. If he leaves it will be the start of a new cycle, but with the quality of players we have I’m not worried.<br /><br />A really strong start to the season helped me earn a place in the France national team. After that, with the build-up of games, I had some physical problems. Every footballer goes through moments when they’re a bit tired. All in all, though, the season went well and I’m quite satisfied<br /><br />I’m under contract for Monaco and right now I’m enjoying being here. As I’ve said before, I’m attracted to the Premier League and I also love Spain. It will all depend on the president and me. With the World Cup a year away, my objective is to maximise my playing time and to perform. The goal is to progress. There will be an evaluation with the club to see what’s best based on the requests</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco vs Club Brugge]</b> It’s got into our heads, me as much as any of the others. There are plenty of young players here and many of them have little experience.</p>
