  <p><b>[Djibril Sidibe says that he would consider a summer move to Arsenal or Barcelona]</b> The risk is going to going to a big club to be a replacement, to go backwards and to be loaned away - it’s complicated. My criteria, it’s playing time. After that, if a club I could not refuse guaranteed me time to play, I would have to think. Every player wants to play against the best in the best leagues. Today, I’m lucky to play with Monaco in a good team. We’re in the Champions League, we’re scoring lots of goals and we’re still capable of winning every competition. I’m very happy at Monaco.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco vs Club Brugge]</b> It’s got into our heads, me as much as any of the others. There are plenty of young players here and many of them have little experience.</p>

It was very easy for me. I did not have to reflect for too long before making my decision to come here. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> are recruiting with the intent to win trophies and play on the biggest stage.I am 100 per cent motivated and ready to help the Club achieve its goals and to achieve my own individual goals</p>
