  <p>[Caio aware of Club World Cup final threats] I think I will have to face Marcelo because I play on the right wing. I am looking forward to seeing him, to talking with him and hugging my compatriot - the same with Vinicius and Casemiro. Marcelo is excellent.<br /><br />If I could remove one Real player from the match who would it be? Sergio Ramos. He is a great defender, he is always well placed, helps his team and is a leader. Without Ramos it would be easier for us<br /><br />[Caio admits they are now massive underdogs] It was special and gratifying to play against champions like River Plate and we’re really happy after a victory and to play in the final. River Plate is a strong team and they came back after our first goal but we also made an extra effort. I’m happy with my goal to help my team to win. We don’t have a secret, only to give our best. It’s clear for us that we have to leave the pitch having given our all and this could be the only advantage for us. It is true that our fans are supporting us and it is also motivation that all the people think Al Ain won’t win. We have played three consecutive matches and we’re tired but I expect to be recovered before the final. We had time to rest and to be with our families, to think about other things and not about football and we’re focused on the final.</p>

  <p>[Who is Caio? The Brazilian football reject who could pile on misery for Real Madrid] They said from the start that I was not big enough to be a player. They made up a reason to get rid of me. I know deep inside that it was a great experience and I learned a lot there.<br /><br />[His fortunes changed, however, when he heard of a trial held alongside a touring Japanese high school] I touched the ball twice and they picked me up<br /><br />[Only the unique Japanese cuisine seemed to pose a problem] You’ve seen those raw fish sitting there or those other things that look like they are going to start moving. I only used to eat rice with ketchup or mayonnaise. That came to the rescue when I didn’t have food I liked, then I learned to eat it<br /><br />I have dressed up as a sheikh for photos because I am trying to enjoy the culture and interact with fans. But it is a different kind of sheikh because since I am married and I came with my wife - there will not be any harems here!</p>
