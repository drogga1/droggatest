  <p><b>[Chris Smalling dubbed Smalldinis as Italian legends Fulvio Collovati explain why <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> defender is shining for Roma]</b> For an English player, it is not easy leaving his country but Smalling is proving to be a great defender. He marks his opponents well, he can move the ball well, is good in the air and sometimes he scores. What more can you ask from a defender? I must admit, I didnâ€™t know much about him until this season but I am impressed. I believe United have made a mistake by allowing him to be here</p>
