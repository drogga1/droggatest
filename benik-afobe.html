  <p><b>[Benik Afobe tells about a memory from his and team-mate <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> youth days]</b> I was 11, but playing a year up in <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>’s team. He was captain, but I remember us having so many arguments because he was so greedy, even though now everyone thinks of him as a creative player! We called him ‘the wriggler’ because he used to get the ball from the centre-half and just dribble the ball as far as he could, going past four or five players. We played in a tournament in Genk and players like <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> and <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> were there, a lot who have made the grade. We got to the final and Jack was favourite to get player of the tournament - but he got sent off in the first ten minutes! That meant they didn’t give the award to him, so he cried the whole way home. I was lucky enough to get top goalscorer, ahead of some good players</p>

  <p><b>[Bristol City striker Benik Afobe has thanked fans for their support following the death of his two-year-old daughter Amora]</b> I’ve had to come off private on Instagram to personally make a public statement. On the behalf of Lois, my family and myself, I would like to say thank you to everyone who has messaged or prayed about the death of our baby girl Amora 9 days ago. The support we have received is something we will never forget and it means the world to us. You’ve all given us hope and showed the world can come together at times like this and we can all be one.<br /><br />Not many know but Amora has a 1 year old sister called <a href="jordi-alba.html">Alba</a> and we will be strong for her and Amora now lives inside her little sisters heart and will drive her to grow up and be bold and brave like her older sister was. We trust in our Lord Jesus Christ and when we are weak he comforts us. He will protect the family and gives us strength always. We want to bounce back and show people that even when we are grieving, we can make a comeback and be strong and never quit in anything you want to do or become.<br /><br />I wish I could reply to every person that has messaged me to tell everyone how much it means to us all from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you to every football club who posted a message and for the world for being there for us. God bless you all. Love Afobe family</p>
