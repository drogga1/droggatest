  <p><b>[Liverpool are no longer a sleeping giant under Jurgen Klopp]</b> It’s very different six years on. We have moved the club forward quite a bit in that time. Clearly, from a commercial standpoint, which has been my area of responsibility, that’s grown significantly. But more importantly and I think what everyone is most proud of is the strategy we’ve had since FSG <b>[Fenway Sports Group]</b> took ownership - how we built the club in a sustainable way over the long-term to be successful on the pitch. That’s ultimately what this is all about - everyone here wants to win. Across the whole team of staff off the pitch there’s a huge desire to return the club to where we believe it belongs at the top of world football. We can’t do that by kicking a ball but we can do that by helping to drive the business forward.<br /><br /><b>[The Reds have developed a reputation as one of the best sides to watch in the Premier League]</b> This is about making our fans proud of the club. The football is terrific, the team is playing great and we’re all excited about the future. If you go back to when FSG first started looking at Liverpool as an opportunity, people were referring to the club as a sleeping giant. I think that’s something that’s been proven to be true<br /><br />Jurgen is a big personality and he’s also tremendously supportive. He completely gets that what we’re trying to do from the commercial side is generate revenues that we invest back into the football side. The ‘Klopp factor’ is more than just about his interaction with football, it’s across the whole club. He’s a tremendous fit and we’re so happy that he’s here</p>
