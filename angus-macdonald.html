  <p><b>[Angus MacDonald began his club career with Reading and enjoyed notable stints with Salusbury City, Torquay United and Barnsley - the latter of which he was named captain of before joining Hull in early 2018]</b> It’s a big step for me and I’m looking forward to getting going here. This is a big club and a chance for me to progress my career. When you arrive at a club, you’re always going to have to fight for a place in the team and I’ll look to do that by trying to impress in training</p>
