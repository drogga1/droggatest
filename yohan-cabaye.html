  <p>[Yohan Cabaye believes Lassana Diarra will bring a healthy competition to the France squad following his return to international football] Lassana is a great player, he’s shown that, especially since he was out for so long. He has great qualities which will only improve the level of the team. The France team isn’t me, it’s everyone. Again, if Lass can bring his qualities and his experience, everyone wins. Then it’s up to the coach to make decisions. There’s no problem.<br /><br />I feel very good. I have another approach to training. It allows me to prepare differently. To have the confidence of the coach is important to me. It gives me confidence coming here. The system is different at club level. We play with two defensive midfielders. You have to find your bearings quickly coming here, to play with your head, but I’m not worried. It comes naturally</p>

  <p>[Yohan Cabaye says France are motivated by the prospect of paying tribute to the victims of November’s terrorist attacks in Paris with victory at Euro 2016] It was a very sad moment, very difficult. It’s in that bad time that the country came back and stuck together just to show everyone that we are determined to fight for our country. All the fans, even us; we’re going to think about what happened in November and it will be nice to win for those victims as well.<br /><br />It will be a big competition at home. Of course I want to be in the squad. We are focused on that competition just to win it. We’ve got a good team. Some of the young players are fantastic. I think we have to get that winning mentality. Every game I hope the crowd will be like a 12th man on the pitch, just to help us and give us something more. In the last two home competitions, I think France won it. So maybe</p>
