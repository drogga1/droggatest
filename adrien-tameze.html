<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marco Verratti is the finest midfielder in Ligue 1]</b> The player who impresses me the most is Luka Modric. That’s not very original as he was voted the best FIFA player but it’s him that impresses me the most in the middle. I watch a lot of football and of course I try to learn from all of the good players in my position. In France, the best is Verratti<br /><br />They must lose one day! Or at least draw. That’s going to be the challenge, being the first team to stop them from taking three points. I don’t think they are as good collectively as they have been in recent years but I am still getting my legs ready because what is certain is that we will have run a lot against them.<br /><br /><b>[On Patrick Vieira]</b> He is very close to his players. I really like this kind of coach who takes the opportunity to talk with everybody. He is both a leader and a coach focused on tactics. I cannot really say if he will go more one way than the other in the future. He is a good tactician who has specific ideas about what he wants to do and is a leader of men who can talk and connect with everyone</p>
