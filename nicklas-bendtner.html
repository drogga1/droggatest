  <p><b>[Nicklas Bendtner is pleased Denmark have a fighting chance of reaching Euro 2016 after they struck late in Saturday’s 2-1 qualifying play-off loss to Sweden]</b> We talked at half-time that we had to go out and do better for the second half. So it is obviously negative, they got a penalty, but the positive is that we scored so we were in the game.<br /><br />In the periods where we played ball, we did well. But we did not do it enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Nicklas Bendtner on being nicknamed ‘Lord’ by the Wolfsburg supporters]</b> I don’t know where it comes from or understand if it is funny. Am I being ridiculed? Is it serious? My mother always told me that I am person who polarises opinion. There is this saying in Denmark: ‘You are someone who divides the sea’. I meet some people who think that I am the greatest person in the world. I meet others who want to throw bottles at me</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> forward Nicklas Bendtner speaks ahead of his meeting with former club <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the EFL Cup]</b> I pictured my career going in a different way, but it didn’t. So I’m going to make the best out of the rest of my career and do the best I can. There are many goals I have set myself over the years. Many things I have said and been killed for. I actually don’t regret saying I want to be the best striker in the world, because that’s what everyone wants. It’s just that no one wants to say it. It has haunted me. I was very young and I might have said it too early, before I’d proved I was in that category - or could get in that category. But I’m here now and I want to reboot, and get back to just playing. I am not saying I have never done anything wrong, because I have. But I know football makes me happy whatever level I play and I think I’ll play football all my life</p>

  <p><b>[Nicklas Bendtner has moved to calm fears that he will be leaving current club Rosenborg BK after putting his house up for sale]</b> My girlfriend and I were lying around and having a Harry Potter marathon. Then we went to make some tea and I turned off the television for a short while. Then I heard a strange noise coming from outside. ‘What the hell is this?’ I thought.<br /><br />I’ve been forced to keep the curtains closed. I don’t know how this is possible at all. Regardless, you definitely shouldn’t see this as any kind of signal about my future at Rosenborg<br /><br />As you’ve been able to read in the press for the past couple of days, I was involved in an extremely unfortunate and uncomfortable incident. I could not in my wildest fantasies imagine that it would develop as it did, and, of course, I’m extremely sad that the outcome became as unfortunate as it did. To Rosenborg fans, I regret that this has happened. From the start, it has been a pleasure to play for Rosenborg’s faithful crowd, and I have made it my honour to make them proud of myself and the team. To the club, I’m sorry with all my heart that we are standing here today. Rosenborg has been more than a good club to me. It felt like a new home and a new family, as I needed more than ever a change of air and a new start. The black and white kit is close to my heart, even when I’m not wearing it. Due to the pending legal case, I can’t comment further, but instead must refer to solicitor Anders Nemeth</p>

  <p><b>[Nicklas Bendtner is set to be the subject of a Danish reality show alongside model girlfriend Philine Roepstorff]</b> Both Philine and I are used to being in the media spotlight. Many stories are written about us, and we often find that only half the truth emerges. In my book I talk about the ups and downs that have shaped my life and my career so far, and this series is a natural continuation of that tale<br /><br />We considered for a long time whether our relationship was strong enough to handle all the attention that comes naturally when you say yes to letting a camera crew get really close. We were well aware that it wouldn’t become a glossy tale with us as protagonists. But, we’ve never been interested in that either<br /><br />It is a huge part of our lives to have fun in each other’s company and although we can be both enemies and fight loudly, we have a chemistry and an internal humour that we are proud of and would like to show to all Denmark, as it very much defines who we are as couples and as individuals</p>
