  <p><b>[Former <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a> team-mate Jake Livermore says <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>’s success at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has come as no surprise]</b> I remember looking at his feet once and saying, ‘Blimey, what happened to them?’ All his toes were facing the wrong way! I started making a bit of a thing out of it, as a bit of friendly banter to get him involved with the other boys and get him on board. Then all of a sudden we were doing a bit of crossing and … wow. I found myself saying, ‘Has that come off that dodgy toe that’s facing the other way?’ I watched him whipping them in every day and little ‘manky foot’ was unbelievable<br /><br />What a buy <b>[Robertson]</b> that was for Hull. Once he grew physically and got the experience, he was brilliant. I am so happy to see him doing so well at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He’s one of those boys, like <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>, whom you play alongside and just want to see doing well because they have no ego and get on with their work</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom’s grip on an automatic promotion spot loosened as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Fulham]</b> Our goal hasn’t changed. In a peculiar season, our target still remains and we’re going to give it our very, very best shot, that’s all we can do</p>
