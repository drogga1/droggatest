  <p><b>[The exploits of Mohamed Salah at Liverpool are allowing Egyptian youngsters to dream of following in his footsteps]</b> Now we have a very good team with Mo Salah. He’s representing Egyptians very well in England and Liverpool. He’s doing very good and we all support him always. We all have his back and we always pray for him and always follow him because he is representing us as Egyptians and as Arabs. He’s a good example, as we were before - me and other Egyptian colleagues who played in Europe, like Mido, Ahmed Hassan and many other players who played in top leagues.<br /><br />Now Mo Salah is continuing the legacy of Egyptian players in Europe to make the Egyptian kids keep dreaming, because he’s one of us. Today is Mo Salah time, it is going very well, he is giving hope to all Egyptians and then in the future it will be other kids from Egypt that will play in Europe. It’s not easy for them to come to European leagues because football is not as big with as much interest, but they have to keep believing and fighting. Now I am happy that clubs from Europe come to Thailand and Asia to make cooperations with clubs.</p>
