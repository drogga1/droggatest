<blockquote>
  <p>[Tunisia left-back Oussama Haddadi is under no illusions that progression at the World Cup will be easy] We had a good qualifying campaign. It hasn’t been easy but we’re preparing well. We know that it won’t be simple getting past the first round because we’re in a difficult group with England and Belgium, but we’ll do everything we can to cause a shock. We must not be afraid of other nations. We must be confident, play our game and show the true face of Tunisia<br /><br />[Asked which team is the favourite in a group that also contains Panama] I think that Belgium is the strongest team of its generation on paper, but we know that they’ve done nothing exceptional so far. They didn’t win the Euros and their performance at the last World Cup wasn’t very good. That’s why famous names don’t necessarily make the difference. Some teams have a lot of starts but success doesn’t depend on that. A national team is a collective. Hazard is a very good player… De Bruyne, Mertens… Those are the best players that we’ll face. Then of course England have Kane, Lingard, Sterling… offensive, quick players. But we also have a good group. If we take Portugal, for example, they don’t have many great players besides Ronaldo and two or three others, but it’s a coherent group that won the European Championship. That’s football</p>
