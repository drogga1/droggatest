  <p><b>[Toni Freixa says Bringing <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would not be in the club’s best interest]</b> There are many reasons, I could be speaking for half an hour. The main one is that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has spent the last two years in the media because of news far away from football. His quality is incredible but he offers a lot of doubts about his future performance. We can speak about how he left. He still has a legal demand against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. If <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is ready to make this kind of investment … after <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> we must think about if we need <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. I believe in projects which look for the pieces they need, not ones that are just focused on players who are good in their own right. I can’t understand a project where you are going to add <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to a group with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>, Suarez, <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> and Dembele. It doesn’t look reasonable to me<br /><br /><b>[Freixa thinks there is something else at play in pushing these rumours - parties that stand to profit from a deal]</b> There’s some intermediary involved in his arrival and departure who is interested in the deal. Moving these kinds of players is a big deal and people used to care only about the price. You must know how much <b>[is being paid]</b> in commissions. If commissions were transparent we could easily understand a lot of deals not being in a club’s interest but are in a personal interest. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a clear case to me<br /><br /><b>[Part of Freixa’s frustrations stem from concerns about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s overall financial health. While <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> released a statement last year claiming to be the first club to reach €1 billion in revenues during the 2017-18 fiscal year, rising debts have threatened long-term projects at the club]</b> There’s no money for rebuilding <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, offering another contract renewal to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and buying <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. I am a bit disappointed with the new <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> <b>[project]</b>. I voted five years ago for a project which was supposed to begin three years ago and it hasn’t. I understand it is a big job and the club need a lot of cash. I hope they find the money soon because <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> needs a top-level ground</p>
