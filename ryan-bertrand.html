  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand on getting picked to start for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League final]</b> When the manager told me I was playing, I could hardly believe it. I’m still waiting for someone to pinch me now. I tried to relax and go to sleep in the afternoon, but I had all these images flashing through my mind. I was getting all these flashbacks too, of when I was a kid, growing up in South London - in Peckham, in Bermondsey, tough places - playing against the wall with my mates</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk is not only the best defender in the Premier League, but one of the very best in the world]</b> For me, he is number one. Number one in the Premier League. Even going into the Champions League clubs, he is one of the best and right up there for me. Having played right next to him and seen his capabilities, I know that he is right up there. He has got pace, strength and technical ability. He reads the game well and he is great and very reliable to play alongside.<br /><br /><b>[On James Ward-Prowse]</b> Yes, he has done very well. The likes of him and Redmond have come in and they have done amazingly well. They have got their rewards with a call up to the senior team. They have taken those chances, so they are great commodities for Southampton. For Ward-Prowse, I just think it has been his most consistent season in terms of game time. Sometimes you need that game time to see a player and judge that player. Southampton is a very good club, a grounded club, with good people around it.<br /><br />I am not sure about <b>[David]</b> Beckham <b>[comparisons]</b>. Any player that comes through has idols in mind, legends in mind, but no one wants to replicate anyone too much. You want to create your own brand of football and I am pretty sure he is trying to define himself as a player and that will come out in the years to come. Southampton have a fantastic infrastructure to come and play and enjoy your football. They give you a good platform. They play expansive football and, within reason, they give you that confidence to go out there and enjoy yourself every week. It is a fantastic place to be</p>

  <p><b>[Why I voted for Kante for PFA Player of the Year ahead of Hazard]</b> I think he is a great player. He has gone into Chelsea’s team and he’s done amazing and proved to be key to them. I thought Hazard would naturally grab the plaudits for scoring the goals. That’s what goals and assists do. They grab the minds of people but want Kante has done is amazing. It is great for him to get that recognition. He has managed to attract people’s eyes despite playing in that defensive position this year, so I think he deserves it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand has hailed Gareth Southgate’s impact to date as England’s manager]</b> I think we are in a good place at the moment. Gareth Southgate has really freshened things up and we’ve got that togetherness in the camp and hopefully we can put a marker down, go to the World Cup and progress. I think every manager has their own ways, their own styles, their own philosophies. What he has brought to the table so far the lads I agree with it. We believe in it and we are going to give it our all as well.<br /><br />There’s not necessarily a redemption factor, you go there wanting to make the country proud. Every player that pulls on an England shirt wants to represent England to the highest of their abilities. Hopefully, if we can do that, we can have success. We have quality and depth, and we have had that for many years. It is about showing that consistently on a bigger stage. Everyone is up for the task and, hopefully, we can do that</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand insists he had to leave Chelsea for Southampton because he didn’t necessarily feel like a footballer at Stamford Bridge]</b> I wanted to feel like a footballer. I didn’t necessarily feel like a footballer at Chelsea. It was emotional in terms of Chelsea being the club I had been at since I was young and taken part in one of their most historic moments. There was the emotional attachment but from a football perspective it was a no-brainer <b>[to leave]</b>.<br /><br />When I was there <b>[Chelsea]</b>, whenever I did get the chance to play I never felt the full support to relax and enjoy my football. The times I did play it was like an audition. And that is never healthy. As a young player coming through you want the club to be stable enough to say, ‘We trust in you, go out there and play’. You don’t want to make a young player feel on edge. I wanted that consistency - and for people to judge you they need to see you consistently. Southampton has given me a fantastic base in being able to do that and progress.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been warned by Ryan Bertrand]</b> It’s always good to play against the best players. That is why you play and it’s the ultimate aim. I won’t change my preparations. I’m just looking forward to seeing his strengths and seeing his weaknesses and trying to nullify some and exploiting the others.<br /><br />It’s important for both teams. They are fighting for the Premier League with a chance to create history for their first title in so long. Equally we need the points and are fighting for different reasons. It should be a nice competitive game and I’m really looking forward to it</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand says <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> full-back with boardroom ambitions]</b> It’s an ambition of mine and the race thing hasn’t played on my mind, I haven’t thought of it like that. But if there have been black people that have tried to get into a hierarchy of sports and felt resistance, I think it is important that it is spoken of and that’s how you can create the gateway to producing more black executives within the game. We need to concentrate on making sure the openings are there. No one wants anything for free but at the same time we need to make sure the playing field is level and there isn’t a subconscious bias or an element of racism that’s preferring people when other people are more than capable of doing the job<br /><br />It mixes a bit of business with my sport and they’re both my passions. Having the responsibility to say ‘yes, I chose these players, I chose them to perform well’ and working with a manager and business owner to get the right consistency and the footballing model that’s successful on the field, I would take a lot of pride in that</p>
