  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand on getting picked to start for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League final]</b> When the manager told me I was playing, I could hardly believe it. I’m still waiting for someone to pinch me now. I tried to relax and go to sleep in the afternoon, but I had all these images flashing through my mind. I was getting all these flashbacks too, of when I was a kid, growing up in South London - in Peckham, in Bermondsey, tough places - playing against the wall with my mates</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk is not only the best defender in the Premier League, but one of the very best in the world]</b> For me, he is number one. Number one in the Premier League. Even going into the Champions League clubs, he is one of the best and right up there for me. Having played right next to him and seen his capabilities, I know that he is right up there. He has got pace, strength and technical ability. He reads the game well and he is great and very reliable to play alongside.<br /><br /><b>[On James Ward-Prowse]</b> Yes, he has done very well. The likes of him and Redmond have come in and they have done amazingly well. They have got their rewards with a call up to the senior team. They have taken those chances, so they are great commodities for Southampton. For Ward-Prowse, I just think it has been his most consistent season in terms of game time. Sometimes you need that game time to see a player and judge that player. Southampton is a very good club, a grounded club, with good people around it.<br /><br />I am not sure about <b>[David]</b> Beckham <b>[comparisons]</b>. Any player that comes through has idols in mind, legends in mind, but no one wants to replicate anyone too much. You want to create your own brand of football and I am pretty sure he is trying to define himself as a player and that will come out in the years to come. Southampton have a fantastic infrastructure to come and play and enjoy your football. They give you a good platform. They play expansive football and, within reason, they give you that confidence to go out there and enjoy yourself every week. It is a fantastic place to be</p>

  <p><b>[Why I voted for Kante for PFA Player of the Year ahead of Hazard]</b> I think he is a great player. He has gone into Chelsea’s team and he’s done amazing and proved to be key to them. I thought Hazard would naturally grab the plaudits for scoring the goals. That’s what goals and assists do. They grab the minds of people but want Kante has done is amazing. It is great for him to get that recognition. He has managed to attract people’s eyes despite playing in that defensive position this year, so I think he deserves it.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been warned by Ryan Bertrand]</b> It’s always good to play against the best players. That is why you play and it’s the ultimate aim. I won’t change my preparations. I’m just looking forward to seeing his strengths and seeing his weaknesses and trying to nullify some and exploiting the others.<br /><br />It’s important for both teams. They are fighting for the Premier League with a chance to create history for their first title in so long. Equally we need the points and are fighting for different reasons. It should be a nice competitive game and I’m really looking forward to it</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand says <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> full-back with boardroom ambitions]</b> It’s an ambition of mine and the race thing hasn’t played on my mind, I haven’t thought of it like that. But if there have been black people that have tried to get into a hierarchy of sports and felt resistance, I think it is important that it is spoken of and that’s how you can create the gateway to producing more black executives within the game. We need to concentrate on making sure the openings are there. No one wants anything for free but at the same time we need to make sure the playing field is level and there isn’t a subconscious bias or an element of racism that’s preferring people when other people are more than capable of doing the job<br /><br />It mixes a bit of business with my sport and they’re both my passions. Having the responsibility to say ‘yes, I chose these players, I chose them to perform well’ and working with a manager and business owner to get the right consistency and the footballing model that’s successful on the field, I would take a lot of pride in that</p>
