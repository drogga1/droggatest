  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand on getting picked to start for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League final]</b> When the manager told me I was playing, I could hardly believe it. I’m still waiting for someone to pinch me now. I tried to relax and go to sleep in the afternoon, but I had all these images flashing through my mind. I was getting all these flashbacks too, of when I was a kid, growing up in South London – in Peckham, in Bermondsey, tough places – playing against the wall with my mates</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Bertrand says Southampton full-back with boardroom ambitions]</b> It’s an ambition of mine and the race thing hasn’t played on my mind, I haven’t thought of it like that. But if there have been black people that have tried to get into a hierarchy of sports and felt resistance, I think it is important that it is spoken of and that’s how you can create the gateway to producing more black executives within the game. We need to concentrate on making sure the openings are there. No one wants anything for free but at the same time we need to make sure the playing field is level and there isn’t a subconscious bias or an element of racism that’s preferring people when other people are more than capable of doing the job<br /><br />It mixes a bit of business with my sport and they’re both my passions. Having the responsibility to say ‘yes, I chose these players, I chose them to perform well’ and working with a manager and business owner to get the right consistency and the footballing model that’s successful on the field, I would take a lot of pride in that</p>
