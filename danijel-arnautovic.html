  <p>[Marko Arnautovic may seek a move away from West Ham in the near future] He’s a big part of West Ham’s team but I think it’s possible to tease out more of him. For that to happen, he has to play for a top team. Marko is ready for the next step. A player like him should not play against relegation. He should play for the international spots. Marko is really enjoying playing for West Ham. He loves that club and the fans. But there is still that feeling, that this cannot be the end. And everybody should understand that.<br /><br />[Danijel was then pressed on whether his brother could leave West Ham in the near future] That’s possible. It was already very, very close this last summer</p>

  <p>[<a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Marko Arnautovic</a> has completed a reported £22 million move from <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> to Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG. Prior to the completion of <a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Arnautovic</a>’s move to China, his agent and brother Danijel <a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Arnautovic</a> had been critical of <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> after they initially rejected a £20m offer for the forward] He’s not a cow or a horse which you bring to market. He’s a highly talented footballer who is simply being used by <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. He’s just a number to them. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> were trying to get rid of Marco right up until the last minute of the January transfer window and they are still trying to sell him right now. To them he’s just a commodity. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> are still speaking to the Chinese club. He is still for sale and it’s simply a case of how much money <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> can get for him</p>
