  <p><b>[Haroon Fakhruddin Amiri - ‘I want the people to see the real face of Chennai City coach V Soundararajan’]</b> Everything is a lie. All the things he <b>[coach Soundararajan]</b> told in the media are lies. I have never misbehaved nor did I refuse to warm-up. I saw my name in the substitutes and I was okay with it but I was also surprised given that I had scored two goals recently. Nonetheless, I was hoping I would be called on as a replacement but the coach did not look at my face and tell me to go warm-up during the game.<br /><br />He knows that we are exempt from relegation and he does not care about winning or losing. He just wants to play them in the I-League and when we ask why we are not in the team, he has nothing to say. He doesn’t know which player to play in what position. I swear, I have never seen such an unprofessional coach in my entire career<br /><br />He is trying to antagonise the non-local players and then finding a reason to release us but we have kept silent. I have had a chat with our team owner Rohith Ramesh and he said that it is a misunderstanding and coach and I need to speak alone and sort this matter out. He doesn’t even have the guts to speak alone. I tried to ask him what he told of me to the media after the game in the team bus but the did not reply and told that he won’t speak to me<br /><br />I want the people to see the real face of Chennai City coach V Soundararajan</p>

  <p><b>[Haroon Amiri leaves Chennai City FC after row with coach V Soundararajan]</b> I have never in my entire footballing career played under a more unprofessional coach than Mr. V. Soundararajan. His coaching techniques are basic and less said of his handling of his players the better. I have been falsely been accused twice for which I have proof from my fellow team mates and certain officials. However, I have great respect for the club’s top management and it was because of them even the first time that I kept quiet. For me the Club always is always bigger than everyone, besides I share great love with the owners. But as my relation with the coach is unresolvable, when I met with the top management, we decided it was best I part way in good terms</p>
