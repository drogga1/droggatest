<blockquote>
  <p>[Florent Balmont says there are two sides to Eden Hazard’s game] Eden Hazard. He was definitively the best. He had a vision of the game. Hazard knows when to be individual or collective, he has both sides. He has flair. He did some great things for Lille when the club was champion.<br /><br />[Balmont admits he was concerned by his former club Lille’s plight last year] I was worried, yes. The club was not far from a very, very complicated situation. So I’m glad it’s better. For the fans too. That’s important. When I was in Lille I had a lot of support so I am very happy for them<br /><br />[Balmont is unsure whether he will continue his playing career, admitting he is considering a move into management] I’ve been thinking about that for a year and a half, two years. I really want to try to go to the other side and try a managerial role</p>
