  <p><b>[Naby Keita has spoken of his motivation to hit the ground running]</b> I think it’s fair to say that the Premier League is a tough league. I’m very motivated to be playing in it - it’s an attractive proposition - but I’ve been told by many people that a lot of overseas players come into the Premier League and they take time to integrate, depending on the circumstances. So playing in the Premier League can be difficult, but I am very motivated to play here, not just for myself and my team-mates, but for the club.<br /><br />Everybody around me has been very supportive towards me so I am certainly giving everything I can to get settled into the team quickly<br /><br />Competition for places in midfield is something that can only help the team. Obviously the coach will go ahead and make his choices and I am sure he will choose the best players at the time for each match as they come along. That way, everybody gives their best throughout the season and I think it also gets the best out of everybody</p>

Well, here I am now, I don’t mean I’m not going to be like him because each of us are individuals. He left his own mark, I want to leave my own mark, I am going to work really hard to leave my own mark like he did. To play for Liverpool, that is a dream I had as a child and here I am now.<br /><br />I am really motivated to speak English, it is really important for me. I am following a course. I want to be able to speak to the coach, I want to speak to the other players on the team and I am really working hard. I am hoping in six months I will be able to do these interviews in English<br /><br />I find the scouse accent a bit difficult but I will try my best to learn some.

  <p><b>[Naby Keita has said that Liverpool need to be fully focused and concentrated]</b> It’s down to us to be totally focused and concentrated, it’s all about having more desire than any of our opponents, which will help us win all our games. That’s the objective we’ve all got in our minds. We don’t want to get too worried about the title race or the Champions League - the coach always tells us to focus on each game as it comes and concentrate on winning each game, then we’ll see what happens afterwards. We’re looking forward to the next game and to boost confidence for the supporters and increase our own confidence again, so we can finish the season well. We’re going to do everything we possibly can to win it, to get back on the right track once again.<br /><br /><b>[Keita watched from the bench as Liverpool dropped points against an injury-hit Manchester United]</b> Games like that are never easy, particularly when they’re away from home. Of course, at the moment we’d like to be winning every single game. When we went to Manchester, that’s what we wanted - to win the game. But sometimes it’s not easy, that’s football. We picked up a point and we’re a little bit disappointed. That can happen. We’re a bit disappointed, we wanted three points. We ended up with one and I think that point might come in handy. We put in a decent performance and we did really want to win but it didn’t quite come off - that’s football. Now it’s all about looking forward and trying to win the games ahead of us.</p>

But for me, the most important thing is the team - and I’d love the team to win every match we play. Yes, it’s true it’s taken a while for me to score, but I’m a midfielder and we already have goalscorers here - Mo Salah, Firmino, Sadio - so we in midfield take advantage of the opportunity to help them. We are there to help them score and if we also have the chance to score ourselves, we try to take it. But the most important thing is for the team to win - above everything.<br /><br />When you’re playing, you can’t see yourself - it is people who are watching who know <b>[how well you’re playing that’s good]</b>. “When you hear things like that about yourself, you just have to carry on and try to do more. You can’t stop and you can’t be happy with it. I am happy people appreciate me - and what it does for me is give me more desire to work harder and do more. Yes, of course I’m happy <b>[with my form]</b>. When you do some good things you have to carry on, you must not stop and be happy with just that. If I do good things, I have to carry on working. For me it is nothing <b>[at the moment]</b>, I am going to carry on training and following the advice of the manager during the sessions - and that’s it<br /><br />Chelsea won’t be an easy match. They are a team that will be coming looking for victory at our home ground. But since we are playing at home we will have the fans there supporting us. I think it is important for us, but we’ve not won the points yet, so we’ll do everything we can to try to get them on Sunday</p>

I think I have now improved a lot, apart from my injuries which have kept me out of several matches. He’s somebody who communicates a lot and a coach who explains everything to all his players.<br /><br /><b>[Keita remains something of a work in progress for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> He is a coach that gives you confidence and he is the motivating factor before a match, but you’ve also got to be motivated on the field. When you see him on the sideline and you’re on the field, it’s as if he’s playing with you and that gives you a lot of desire to do better. He’s always there for his players, he’s almost like a best friend but he’s a coach who can communicate with all his players. He will always defend his players because for him all the players are the same. There is no difference to him. He’s always there to explain things to you, such as if you haven’t played the best in a game, which is hard for coaches to do. But that’s a choice he has to make and it helps us fight harder on the training field to push hard so you can be playing at the weekend</p>
