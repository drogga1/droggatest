I took the ball with more freedom to do what I want, playing the ball to strikers and wingers to assist or get in front of goal and score. At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, we have more attacking players like <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, Mane and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> who boast great scoring numbers.

I hope things will be even better next year<br /><br />We won Champions league for the first time since 2005 and were competing for Premier League until the last match, so of course it was good for the team and for me to be part of this in my first season.

  <p><b>[Keita determined to do ‘even better than last season’ and keep <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s unbeaten run going]</b> You always have to remain focused. It’s that focus that brings the desire - and it’s that desire that helps you a lot in achieving your goals. It’s that momentum that motivates us, builds confidence and drives us to do even better. That’s the goal we all set ourselves as players, as a club and as the manager too. I believe we will remain focused and calm and continue to make progress. We know we have players who like to beat our own records. We know what we achieved last season, but we’re not going to just look back on that achievement with any sense of complacency - we’re going to try to do even better than last year<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fell behind to <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s goal after 47 seconds, but a <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> strike was followed up by <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>’s penalty as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> rallied to secure all three points]</b> A tough match like the one we just had gives you more experience, so you can try in subsequent training sessions to eliminate those faults or those attempts that didn’t work out right. We set about correcting those few errors we made in the match against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> during our training sessions in the lead-up to the match at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. Going there and putting in a good performance is paramount for us. As far as I am concerned, not all matches are the same, but we were happy to get the three points against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, that was essential. You can’t always run every game the way you might like to, but the key thing is to come away with the three points</p>

I know him to be the kind of person who always wants to achieve more, and he will continue in that way<br /><br /><b>[Keita added on his enormous pride at seeing his team-mates recognised for their excellence on the biggest stage]</b> The whole dressing room has congratulated them. It’s an honour for them to be nominated, and it serves to mark your achievements up to that point, but it also serves as a motivation to continue improving and working as well. Of course, I am not only happy for Sadio, but the other <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players too: they are all my teammates and I am really happy for them. They had an extraordinary season, and hopefully, are all set to have another one this season and the one after that too. <b>[The nominations]</b>, it gives a big boost of pride to each player; in yourself, pride for your family, for your friends. But with that boost, it’s up to you to keep on keeping on, right until the end and I am sure they will do exactly that</p>

I was rather sad and I can’t say it didn’t affect me<br /><br /><b>[He has made just eight appearances this season]</b> I would love to be involved. My injury put me back a bit but now I feel as though I am back. I’ve been quite pleased with my form but I’d like to do better. I feel that, if I get to play in a lot of matches, I can really try to help the team. I try to play every training session as if it were a match and I always try to raise my game. I raise my head and hope to be selected to go out there and play and win<br /><br /><b>[He said of that opportunity, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> looking to be crowned domestic kings for the first time in 30 years]</b> Well, a record like that can only serve to motivate me more! We’re all here to work for exactly those sort of records and then to surpass them. Hopefully by winning every match those records will come naturally. We don’t want to repeat the error - if you can call it an error after getting 97 points - of falling into second place at the last hurdle at the end of the season. We want to push for new records right until the end of the season. We want to beat our record. It’s in the club’s thinking to do so</p>

I respect his choices, so I was there to work every day. He is somebody who is able to give you explanations on the field, and that helps a lot and when you play of course you don’t ever doubt yourself. That’s coaching and he sees everything. I think I have now improved a lot, apart from my injuries which have kept me out of several matches. He’s somebody who communicates a lot and a coach who explains everything to all his players.<br /><br /><b>[Keita remains something of a work in progress for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> He is a coach that gives you confidence and he is the motivating factor before a match, but you’ve also got to be motivated on the field. When you see him on the sideline and you’re on the field, it’s as if he’s playing with you and that gives you a lot of desire to do better. He’s always there for his players, he’s almost like a best friend but he’s a coach who can communicate with all his players. He will always defend his players because for him all the players are the same. There is no difference to him. He’s always there to explain things to you, such as if you haven’t played the best in a game, which is hard for coaches to do. But that’s a choice he has to make and it helps us fight harder on the training field to push hard so you can be playing at the weekend</p>
