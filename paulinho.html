  <p><b>[Paulinho says Brazil are going to Montevideo looking for the three points that could seal their qualification for World Cup 2018]</b> We are in form and high on confidence. We hope to get there, to put in a good performance and go in search of victory. We know the quality of the opponent, but if we impose our style on the game we have everything to achieve the win. It’s going to be difficult, and for that reason a draw won’t be a bad result, but we are focused on winning.</p>

  <p><b>[Paulinho opened up on his Premier League exit and his sensational international return]</b> I was very proud to be back after so long. I knew the difficulties, the challenges that lay ahead, but the most important thing was that I had the confidence of my coach and the support of my team-mates. They are why I have kept coming back.<br /><br />Tite has a lot of good options, today he has a few players, tomorrow he can call up others, but I am sure of one thing: both Renato and I have been doing really well. I just try to enjoy the opportunities that come my way. If I’m going to play or not is another story, but if I’m among the 23 then I will always fight for my position<br /><br />I’m happy to be scoring important goals in the national team and here in Guangzhou, too. I have been in very good form since 2015. It’s difficult for me to say if I will go back because things happen very quickly in football. One minute I was with Tottenham, the next came a proposal from China. I took a step back to think about it and decided it was the right time to move. Today, I see that it was the right attitude to take. If I feel I should return, if there is an opportunity that is right and will make me happy, then I will take it. So maybe I can start a new story in Europe<br /><br />In my first season, I played the entire season in my central midfield role. I did well but then we had a change of coach as Andre Villas Boas left and that Englishman <b>[Tim Sherwood]</b> came in. Then Mauricio Pochettino arrived and I did not play much. I only played a maximum of 4 matches in my preferred role and sometimes as a no.10<br /><br />No, no I don’t hurt. Pochettino had his options and at that time he thought I was not the best option for him. But I do think that if he gave me the opportunity in my role then I would have convinced him. When I saw that it was not there, I decided to leave<br /><br />Tite always says that he is paying attention to our form regardless of where we are playing. There are lots of good Brazilian players in China who have the quality to make the difference. We have Ricardo Goulart, Alan, and in the other clubs there’s Alex Teixeira, Hulk, Oscar, Ramires, players who have started the year very well</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Neymar has everything it takes to become the best player in the world]</b> Everybody knows that he is among the best in the world. I do not know how long it will take or whether he will pass the rest, but he has everything to put up big numbers and I am very keen to see him become the best in the world. Neymar is a player who is improving every year, his evolution both on and off the field has been very impressive. Today, he is showing more leadership than before and a great maturity. He has everything it takes to be the best in the world for many years to come.<br /><br /><b>[On Gabriel Jesus]</b> Gabriel has been doing very well and even came back from injury with a goal, but he is still a boy. He has a very good head on his shoulders, he’s an intelligent lad and he has never done anything like try to dictate how we pass to him. He has to keep on doing the simple things he has always done, the things that got him to this stage of his career. He has to keep enjoying it, and stay confident because he has everything to be one of the biggest names in the Premier League. If he stays humble, he can go very far in English football</p>

  <p><b>[The story of Paulinho, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s mystery Brazilian]</b> I was always known by my nickname ‘Paulinho’ in my <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> days. After I left, my agent thought that it was too diminutive and wanted to change it. Nagamura is my last name, so I stuck with it. So, not many people recognise me as the Paulinho from Arsenal; you have to dig deep to find who that guy was<br /><br />Those were three very important years of my career. Even though I didn’t get many opportunities to play with the first team at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, that time prepared me for the career I had ahead<br /><br /><b>[He, along with his team-mate Juan, were signed in a double deal and moved to England in the summer of 2001 to join up with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Under-19s]</b> It was just a dream come true for us. It was a big change in culture for us, so I was glad Juan was there and we had each other. <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> was also there at the time and we were always with him whenever he was free. He would take us to his home and have his wife make lunch and dinner for us because he knew what type of life we had. It’s tough for young South Americans living in a different country and not having their parents or family with them. He did a great job of really looking after us in London and we really appreciated that because he made our lives much better. I’m very happy to see him <b>[<a href="edu.html">Edu</a>]</b> back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now. I’ve always followed his career. I’ve lost contact with him a little bit, but I’m always cheering for him to have a successful time wherever he goes.<br /><br /><b>[Nagamura played no part in either success, but the experience of working so closely with the likes of <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> and <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a> during that period still lives long in his memory]</b> I still can’t describe what it was like. I had been watching players like Henry, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> and <a href="robert-pires.html">Pires</a> on TV back in Brazil saying ‘Oh my God, look at those players’ and then in a matter of months, I was right there training with them, competing with them and learning from them as well.<br /><br />I’m just so fortunate to have had that experience because that group was unbelievable. I spent most of my time with the Under-19s and the reserves, but the times that I trained with the first-team it was like ‘What the heck - look at those guys!’. Just watching <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> control the ball, his unbelievable technique… The explosion of Henry, the intelligence of <a href="robert-pires.html">Pires</a> and the leadership from Vieira, <a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a>, Adams…. Those are just things you can’t forget!<br /><br /><a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> was by far the best. He was a genius. It’s one thing when you watch a guy on the TV, but it’s another thing when you watch him on a daily basis and see him do things that just take your breath away.<br /><br />The things he used to do were so complicated for every other player, but for him it was all so simple. The technique, the control, the intelligence, the vision, the awareness of where he was on the field. He was the complete package that nowadays is so hard to find<br /><br />That group was so special. It was just so hard to break though. There were so many talented players in the youth system at the time who never made it. We all had to go somewhere else because the standard was so high. We had Steven Sidwell, <a href="david-bentley.html">David Bentley</a>, Graham Barrett, Juan, <a href="jermain-pennant.html">Jermaine Pennant</a>. There was a lot of good young players there, but you had to be really, really special to make it to that team<br /><br /><b>[An opportunity then arose with <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. He made the move in March 2005 and other than a brief stint with Tigres in Mexico in 2010, he has remained in America ever since]</b> I knew that my time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was done. Those three years were amazing. I have nothing negative to say about that club. They were so good with me, but I just decided to try a different route. I had different offers when I left, but the one in the States in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> was different. I’m the type of guy that likes a challenge and I’m really glad I took that challenge. It worked out well for me.<br /><br /><b>[He would go on to add another <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup success to his collection a year later as well as two more Lamar Hunt US Open Cups]</b> At Sporting, I found a home. The club is a very good club, well structured. It has a great stadium and a great fanbase. I found myself here. It was a win-win for both myself and the club and we were able to have a very good team and won three championships in five years. In all, I played 12 years here in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. I won five championships with two different clubs, so I believe it was a successful career and I go back to what I said earlier, it was mainly because of those three years in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I had so many adversities to overcome in London that definitely made me a better person and a better player</p>

  <p><b>[Incidentally, his unwavering form has its roots in some sage advice he received from fellow Brazilian <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a>]</b> I live by something that <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> once told me, when I was going through a difficult time in my life. He said, ‘We are just kids playing in the rain, man. If it goes wrong, so what? Is it the end of the world? No, man. We’ll just go find somewhere else to play.<br /><br />I’ve played football my entire life, all over the world, and the one thing I’ve learned is that the important thing is to enjoy your work. You have to go to sleep at night staring at the wall, thinking, ‘Damn, I can’t wait for it to be morning so I can have the ball at my feet again!’. You can only play your best football in these conditions<br /><br /><b>[While form and fortune have played their part in the Brazlian’s goalscoring exploits, the man himself stressed his side’s tactics have been key]</b> Actually, I think it’s mainly due to the difference in the formation of our selection this season. In past seasons, we may have played more defenders, but no matter what combination we used this season, we had three midfielders in most games, so in this system I can have more degrees of freedom to go forward. I think this year’s tactics have helped me to score more goals<br /><br /><b>[Confidence has also inevitably played its part with Paulinho even adopting the catch cry of a previous Guangzhou captain]</b> The phrase ‘have confidence’ is a mantra of the club leader in the past. Before most matches, he would come to our dressing room to cheer. The town arm also shouted the words ‘have confidence’ so this is where it came from. After winning the first championship in the Chinese League in 15 years, I had a celebration party in Beijing at that time. I was very excited and shouted this sentence to everyone. Slowly, this sentence became well known by many fans and friends, and it has become a very iconic personal mantra<br /><br /><b>[But by 2018 Paulinho signed by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> after being approached by <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> himself and he also secured his spot at the 2018 World Cup]</b> People said that my career was over when I went to <a href="guangzhou-evergrande.html">Guangzhou Evergrande</a>. I was not dreaming about playing in another World Cup. I definitely was not dreaming of playing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. My goal was simply to play good football, every day. But seriously, if you think my transfer from Guangzhou to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is crazy, then you don’t know my whole story. That was just Chapter 10. My whole story is way more unreal</p>
