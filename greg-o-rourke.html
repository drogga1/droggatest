  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets coach Mark Jones has backed FFA’s decision to postpone Saturday’s match against Melbourne Victory due to extreme heat]</b> Today’s forecast leaves no doubt that the conditions on Saturday in Newcastle will be significantly above the thresholds we have in place under the FFA Heat Policy so we have made the decision to move the Newcastle v Melbourne Victory match to Monday night. Taking into consideration the obvious player welfare concerns as well as the need to give players, teams and fans the best possible opportunity to plan for the match, moving the match to Monday night is the only decision we could make. We have spoken to both clubs who have welcomed the decision.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA fine Western Sydney Wanderers $20,000 over ‘highly offensive’ banner]</b> The actions of the Western Sydney Wanderers spectators responsible for displaying the banner and the ensuing celebration of the banner on social media were completely unacceptable. While we have noted and were pleased with the positive proactive measures undertaken by the Western Sydney Wanderers the fine reflects the fact clubs are responsible for the actions of their spectators and managing the approval of the game day banners and activities of their active fan groups.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aloisi has reiterated his demand that Football Federation Australia be more flexible with A-League scheduling following Brisbane Roar’s 6-0 loss to Ulsan in the AFC Champions League]</b> I’ve been speaking to a couple of others about making sure that we have some flexibility around the ACL draw for next year. The only constraint around that will be venue availability.</p>

  <p><b>[The Head of the A-League Greg O’Rourke claimed VAR might overtake such individual schemes]</b> The EPL <b>[Premier League]</b> have their goal-line technology as you know but then they don’t have the broader technology that we’re bringing in. We might find that actually goal-line technology is actually superseded by the fact that we have the VAR because it will pick up all the goal/no goal decisions.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA have issued the Wanderers with a show cause notice for the flare incident]</b> We will continue to work with all our clubs, venues, security and the police authorities to maintain a safe and secure environment for the vast majority of football fans who attend matches and support their team in a peaceful and good natured way week in and week out.</p>

  <p><b>[It later emerged that the lack of an intervention from VAR was due to a technical problem that saw the video feed crash right before the goal]</b> On this occasion the technology itself failed and the broadcast angles required were unavailable. We are working with Hawkeye to thoroughly understand why it did and what can be done to prevent this happening again. Whilst we understand that this happened only once this season it was at a most critical time. All parties desire the technology to be failure proof and that is what we will be striving for.</p>
