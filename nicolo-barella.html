  <p><b>[Intermilan have announced the signing of Nicolo Barella from Cagliari on an initial one-year loan]</b> He’s not shy on the pitch, he’s not afraid. He gets involved in tackles on many occasions because he wants to win back the ball, because he wants to win. Last season, he was the player who regained possession the most out of all the players in the league, while he’s also the midfielder who has won the most duels in the past two seasons</p>

  <p><b>[Inter have announced the signing of Nicolo Barella from Cagliari on an initial one-year loan]</b> In the life of every boy, sooner or later the time comes to leave home to continue on his own journey. It is with a touch of emotion that the club sees Nicolo leaving today. Born in Cagliari, a supporter of his city team, he grew up carrying more and more responsibility on his shoulders: with Sardinian pride he developed the temper of the leader, without trembling in front of the most difficult challenges and even wearing the captain’s armband. This Rossoblu home will always be yours too. Goodbye, Nicolo</p>

Then I will make a decision<br /><br /><b>[Barella has emerged as an important member of <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s first-team squad at Inter]</b> He <b>[Conte]</b> has a different attitude, a way of talking to you that gives you something new. I’d die for him, that applies to all his players. And that makes the difference. Do you see how <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s teams run? It’s not only because they are well prepared. It is the outcome of what he puts in your head. Years ago I wrote all my goals down. The first was to get to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> with Cagliari: I succeeded.

Yes. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> has more than just experience, they have known each other for the longest time as a group. But the coach <b>[Conte]</b> immediately told us the clear things he wanted and we are putting them into practice, that’s why I say that we’re on par. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> won the championship with a 21-point advantage last year: we want to cut the gap, we will see if we succeed</p>

The investigations showed a detachment of a cartilaginous fragment of the patella. Barella must undergo arthroscopic removal of the fragment</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Caceres had cancelled out Antonio Candreva’s opener prior to Nicolo Barella’s wonderful half-volley]</b> I tried and it went right into the far bottom corner.
