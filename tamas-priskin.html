<blockquote>
  <p>[Tamas Priskin dedicated his crucial goal against Norway to former Hungary goalkeeper Marton Fulop, who died this week] My best goal? I think so yes. It was a very important goal and I would like to dedicate that goal to Marton Fulop, to my very good friend. It is a big, big thing for me and my team-mates also and I am very happy that we did this big thing. It is very important for my country so I am very happy.<br /><br />I think that shows that the team has a good character. After that game we played very compact. We didn’t concede many goals so we were very good in defence and we won the important games. I am very happy that we played against a good side in this game and we reached our targets</p>
