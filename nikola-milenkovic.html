  <p><b>[Nikola Milenkovic had made just three previous appearances in Serie A when he came face to face with Gonzalo Higuain]</b> I’ll tell you the truth: for me, the name of the opponent doesn’t matter. It’s never conditioned me. Everyone deserves respect and great application if you want to do your job well. The Juve centre-forward or not, they’re all the same for me: I have to do everything to stop them.<br /><br />It is magnificent to be compared to the likes of Vidic but I have to stay humble with both feet firmly on the ground. Vidic was one hell of a player, while I am in the fledgling stage of my career and, hence, I have to keep working hard in order to climb that mountain<br /><br /><b>[He has already been dismissed twice in 34 Serie A appearances]</b> I needed the reds; I learned from them. That’s my character: I always like to learn, to understand. Even when I was on the bench <b>[at Fiorentina]</b>, I tried to absorb everything. I never missed a thing from the games I watched without playing. Only in this way can one improve. That has always been my mentality since I was a child. I watch the big games because I like football but above all else because I want to improve. One understands so many things by watching the best players<br /><br /><b>[On Nemanja Vidic]</b> I would like to have his ability to put his opponent in difficulty, any opponent in the world</p>
