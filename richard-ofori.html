<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ghana goalkeeper Richard Ofori has admitted his happiness after joining South African Premier Soccer League club Maritzburg United from Wa All Stars]</b> I’ve been following them since last year. The game in Cape Town against Cape Town City, I was there. When <b>[Evans]</b> Rusike scored that free-kick, I was there.<br /><br />They were playing very well and I said to myself I would love to be with this team. Here, I am now with the team and I am hoping everything will go well for us. I will need to show that experience by motivating the players. They play in front of me. I see everything that’s happening. I have to motivate them. It’s all about team work. I can’t wait to go to training tomorrow and meet my new family<br /><br />I have heard about them, they are very passionate. I ask them to keep supporting the club because at the end it’s not about us the players, it’s not about management, it’s about the family. It’s about Maritzburg. It’s about the city</p>
