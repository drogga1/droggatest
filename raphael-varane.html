  <p><b>[Raphael Varane insists that Cristiano Ronaldo always finds a way to silence his doubters]</b> I believe that the other forwards can also contribute important goals, although it is true that Cristiano does incredible things. Every time we think he’s going to go down a bit, he comes back to pile up a lot of goals. With Cristiano we are used to him surprising us year after year.<br /><br />It is evident that there are many people who dream of seeing us fall. No doubt. However, they are not the majority. We feel the affection of our fans and we know that Madrid is a club adored across the whole world. In recent years we are present in the decisive moments of the Champions League and certain people cannot stand it and want to see us lose. But that’s part of football. I am aware that they are waiting for us against Bayern and that it will be more complicated than last season. But I insist, the critics are not a majority. There are many people who support us</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale &amp; Karim Benzema backed by Raphael Varane to support Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> In training I’ve seen him being prepared incredibly well physically, he’s focused on the final but it’s the coach who’ll decide who plays. We all want to play and we’re all working hard to prepare properly, there can be a choice of numerous systems but I don’t know who will be selected. I’ve seen Gareth playing very well recently, he’s in good form but we’ll see what decision the coach makes<br /><br />He has the ability to make others play well and I feel he’s in good form. Last season against Atletico Madrid he showed he can decide the biggest matches, everyone is confident in him and he’s got nothing at all to prove<br /><br />Cristiano always responds in the vital moments, he believes in himself and we count on him. We know exactly what he brings to the team and it’s so positive. Hopefully, he’s at his strongest level</p>

  <p><b>[Raphael Varane has admitted that whoever replaces Zinedine Zidane as the next Merengue coach will find it very hard to match the Frenchman’s sparkling record at the club]</b> What kind of coach do Madrid need? I think you need a good coach! A coach who is able to evolve in the context of Real Madrid with a lot of pressure. Zizou did something that will be difficult to do again. We won’t ask to the new coach to win so many trophies in such a short time. I think there are very good coaches in Europe and we will see who will be chosen. It has to be someone with a character who can rise to the challenge.<br /><br />Were there signs <b>[of his resignation]</b>? Yes and no. The job is a tough one, it takes a lot out of you. He told us at the last minute and we will see later if we meet again at <b>[France training base]</b> Clairefontaine. This isn’t the time to talk about that. Those who are happy to speak out about him, like the coach or the president, are free to do so</p>

We tried to play our football but couldn’t. It’s a collective problem, so we must be united and keep working like always. Conceding 19 goals in La Liga is a collective problem.

I hope our leaders will make sure that it is doable and not impossible for the players. We are going to see when we can go back to work, back to training, and matches. We will take things as they come. It is difficult to plan ahead, we are seeing from day to day<br /><br />It’s a pleasure, not a constraint <b>[to be at home]</b>. It’s different, but we adapt. I do physical work, a bit of strength training - I am stronger than ever! We are working especially on things we don’t have time to work on during the rest of the season - certain areas of the body, weak points. When things like this happen to us, we have to continue moving forward, not mope around</p>
