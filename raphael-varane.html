  <p><b>[Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane reveals that manager <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> was a factor behind his decision to stay at the club]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is the best place for me to continue my career. It was a good decision to stay at Madrid. I believe in the club and I believe in the coach.

  <p><b>[Varane speaks out on France team-mate’s Real Madrid]</b> I don’t want to talk about potential signings. I am focused on France. I have not talked to Kylian directly. We are focused on our preparation and on tomorrow’s game and upcoming ones, so I won’t talk about possible transfers.<br /><br />Kylian is very important for France. We count on him very much. During a career there some steps we need to take growing up, that’s natural. Kylian keeps learning and going forward, which he does very quickly. It’s good that he is ambitious. He is self-confident, it’s good. He always wants more. Things come naturally in a career. From experience, I know that things progress season by season. It’s never easy but it’s good, and with France he is always growing in confidence.</p>

  <p><b>[Is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s silent leader Varane really ready to walk away?]</b> I wasn’t really sure if it was him or not. I was really stressed out so I said to him: ‘Ok, but I’m a bit busy right now. Can you call me another time?’ And I put the phone down<br /><br /><b>[However, it’s a two-way street and Madrid aren’t impressed by Varane’s refusal to dismiss links to other clubs]</b> I don’t feel like talking about my future. I try to transmit calmness and motivation to my team-mates. It would be against my nature if I shouted or banged the walls. Some make a lot of noise for no reason and don’t serve as an example <b>[to others]</b>. When I speak, they listen to me. I do this very well and this is something I learned from <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a>.<br /><br />I was able to observe his way of going about things. He inspires deep respect in a dressing room like Real’s without needing to shout</p>

  <p><b>[Raphael Varane believes France team-mate Paul Pogba would be a fantastic addition if he joined Real Madrid during the transfer window]</b> I think we have a team. Pogba is a good player, I know him very well. For any team he would be fantastic. I trust my team-mates. If new players come, we’ll see. I trust my team-mates<br /><br /><b>[Varane is retaining belief in Zinedine Zidane’s team]</b> I understand that you always want to improve. We are working on that and I trust in our work. It is true that on an individual level we are making mistakes. They’re not tactical, they’re technical errors. This will be corrected. I think we’re going to improve little by little. We are focused on our work. I understand that there are many expectations. I also want to see Madrid win, we all want more, it’s good and normal. I remember that in 2017, when we won everything, we started the pre-season badly, with defeats. We all know that when the competition starts, Madrid is something else. This is not an excuse. We are focused on friendly matches. You have to be calm, this season didn’t start. When it starts, we’ll be ready</p>

He is happy to come to Madrid. He will be very well received. Anything can happen in football, and we’ll see if he will be able to play regularly in Madrid. I know his qualities. He has cards to play and I hope for him that he is going to have a good season. He is ready for it. He has confidence in his ability, and we will help him settle in<br /><br /><b>[After last week’s 4-1 over Albania, Deschamps’ side face minnows Andorra on Tuesday in what will be France’s 100th game at the State de France]</b> The stadium is very important for us. There have been some great matches here. It’s home. We are happy to have this stadium, you think of Euro 2016, and especially <b>[the World Cup in]</b> 1998. We feel the support from the crowd and we’re very happy to play here. We will have to be on our guard. We will have more of the ball, but we have to make good use of it. There are no easy matches at international level and we have an opponent who will not give up. We know what to expect and we must not fall into the trap of thinking it will be easy</p>

When I arrived in Madrid, there were two Frenchmen, him and Lassana Diarra.<br /><br />We have known each other for eight years now. We’ve had great moments together. We talk a lot. We talk a lot about football, in good and bad times.<br /><br />We have a very good relationship. He has more experience than me, so he can have a role of giving advice on how to approach things at the highest level and how to last that level because he’s been at Madrid a while and his longevity is exceptional</p>

He has his characteristics and he demands great focus from you and you have to defend him together with your team-mates. It’s a collective effort <b>[…]</b> we have to leave him as little space as possible<br /><br />I don’t see much of a difference. They always have the same identity and playing style out on the pitch and the same philosophy, and the important players are the same. We know that it’s always difficult to play against them but at the same time we know what to expect<br /><br /><b>[Varane tipped both teams to deliver a spectacle befitting what he claimed was the highest-quality fixture in world football]</b> I believe that in these kinds of games you always want to come into them with confidence. But it’s special, no doubt. When both teams take to the field they leave their doubts aside, it’s a battle. It doesn’t really matter how the last few games have been. When you step out onto the field, everything’s different</p>

  <p><b>[Raphael Varane has offered an insight into the pressure placed on the shoulders of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> players]</b> It’s a different kind of pressure. Every day, there are numerous newspapers, television and radio programmes, etc. And what happens in Madrid often has repercussions all over the world. They’re global. The pressure inside the club is also huge. The fans are extremely demanding: winning is good, but it’s never enough, you always have to improve your play. A draw is catastrophic. It’s a level of standards greater than at any other club. We feel this and live with it. Not all footballers can live with this. I have seen players that can’t cope<br /><br /><b>[Varane went on to express his admiration towards <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, describing his talent as extraordinary]</b> On a human and footballing level I don’t even have words anymore.

I am super nice, I am great, even in the dressing room. I am also quite shy. But when there are difficult times or when you have to show your character, you can count on me. The players who have known me for a while know this.<br /><br />Of course, it’s not the aspect of my character that you see the most or that you see first. It was not a matter of respect or disrespect, it was just a matter of, ‘If I’m not seen, I’m not considered much’.
