<blockquote>
  <p>On Tuesday, Kremlin-backed forces further stepped up to fill the vacuum left in northern Syria by the US. Russian military police units patrolled the contact line between Syrian and Turkish forces, while Putin-backed Bashar al-Assad troops gained full control of the town of Manbij and surrounding areas, according to a Russian defense ministry statement published on its website<br /><br />In Saudi – one of America’s closest allies – the Russian president received a warm welcome during his first visit to the kingdom in over a decade. The Kremlin called it a ‘return visit’ after Saudi’s King Salman visited Moscow in 2017 to broaden the key oil producers’ relationship. It is a ‘natural partnership,’ one Russian official told me ahead of this week’s state visit. The ‘world’s biggest oil exporters cooperating to stabilize the markets’<br /><br />… the warmness of Saudi’s embrace of Russia can also be seen as a warning from the kingdom to the US. There is growing criticism among US lawmakers of Saudi conduct, like the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, which the kingdom blames on rogue operatives. There’s also alarm at the alleged targeting of civilians by Saudi-led forces in its war on Houthi rebels in Yemen, which the kingdom denies. US Congress even tried to cut off arms sales, on which Saudi Arabia depends, over the issue<br /><br />… in the past month the US has announced the deployment of an additional 3,000 troops to the country to bolster defenses amid growing tensions with Iran. But criticism and concern about US commitment to the region is causing Saudi Arabia to look elsewhere, perhaps to more reliable and less judgmental friends. The ‘days of a single strategic partner for the kingdom,’ one senior Saudi official told me, ‘are already gone’</p>
