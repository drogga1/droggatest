  <p><b>[Houllier explains why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lost race to sign <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> Ronaldo]</b> I saw him in the Toulon Under-21 tournament and we went for him. But we had a wage scale and we weren’t paying the sort of salary he wanted. Then <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> played a friendly against Sporting Lisbon and all their boys said to Sir Alex Ferguson: ‘You have to sign him’. But I agreed with not breaking the wage structure. I thought it would cause problems in our dressing room. <br /><br /><b>[Instead of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> signed <a href="harry-kewell.html">Kewell</a> from <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>, and the Australia star went on to spend five seasons at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in a spell remembered fondly by supporters despite constant injury problems]</b> Maybe we would have won the title with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, but we had <a href="harry-kewell.html">Harry Kewell</a>, who was outstanding at the time and was very hungry but got a bad injury. After that, he never had the same confidence, the same appetite</p>

  <p><b>[Houllier looking for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to address rare blip]</b> On the day I thought <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> had more intensity in their game. But it’s not the end of the world. It happens. The next game is the most important one for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. A big team doesn’t lose twice in a row, that’s what I think<br /><br />I admire the spirit and the quality of the team, the way they play, the passion and the enthusiasm they have in their game, and I admire a lot my friend <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. We keep in touch and I will go and see him to congratulate him on this title, because if there’s one thing I’m sure of it’s that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win the title. And nobody will be more happy and more proud than I am</p>

  <p><b>[Houllier hopeful 2019-20 season will resume]</b> I hope they will restart the competition, because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are just two wins away from a very long-awaited and deserved title. I would be very disappointed if the season ends now. Too many times have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> finished second, so now they really deserve it – even last year they finished with 97 points with one defeat<br /><br />Even if we play games behind closed doors, there will be great frustration for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans. But I can’t see them not being out in the street anyway just waiting for the players, so maybe it’s better to let them in the stadium. It’s going to be a big shame.<br /><br />We know the passion of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters and if they can’t be in the stadium to see them win it, although we understand these are unprecedented times and the health of people comes first, it would be a shame that for the first time they’re going to win the title in 30 years the fans are probably not going to be in the stadium to witness it</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager Gerard Houllier has caused a stir in France]</b> There is an axis between OM and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and it hit hard. There was an alliance made with arrangements between friends and I think above all it was a plot, a plan to eliminate <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. It will be covered up because I think the French state is involved. I followed all the press conferences by <b>[President]</b> <a href="emmanuel-macron.html">Emmanuel Macron</a> and <b>[Prime Minister]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> Philippe, and they never talked about sport. And just by chance, at the end, it’s said that <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> will not be able to resume. It was the first time they talked about sports. I found it a bit weird<br /><br /><b>[If the season had to be ended, it should have been voided entirely]</b> I found this very unfair. A championship does not stop on the third, 19th or 28th day. We go to the end, otherwise we consider it to be null and void</p>

  <p><b>[Gerard Houllier says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t just win title, they’ll do so in style]</b> The DNA of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is silverware. To get the title it is a special reward for everyone. It has been a long wait of 30 years. It is a title which is a reward to the fans for their loyalty and what they have gone through. It rewards all the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters all around the world. It is a title which rewards the players and their staff. Not only will they win it, but they will do it in style with a 25-point lead at the moment which has never been seen before. In my time we were lucky to have six trophies. But <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> won the Champions League last season then the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Super Cup, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup and now this. It is just a shame to me <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans won’t be able to experience it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. The fans I hope will be disciplined enough to wait until better times to celebrate the title. I hope to be there then too, but we don’t know yet when they are going to be crowned<br /><br />He bought two players who made a huge difference – <b>[Virgil]</b> <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> and Alisson. He spotted the weak points of the team and if you look at the results since Van Dijk and Alisson have been there it is phenomenal. Even last year I would say they nearly deserved to win the title as well. They had one defeat in 38 games and had 97 points. It was just because <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> were outstanding as well and had one more point. You have to give credit, which Jurgen did, to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> who were phenomenal. City also won the title the year before with 100 points. Then the following season to have 98, that is tremendous and you have to acknowledge that.</p>
