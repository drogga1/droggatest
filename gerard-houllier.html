  <p><b>[Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier believes that Monaco should hold out hope of beating Manchester City in the Champions League]</b> If Monaco score a goal, their opponents will start to worry. Offensively, they have many different threats between Kylian Mbappe, Bernardo Silva, Radamel Falcao, a fox in the box, and Thomas Lemar. They can still progress, even if this remains a very important match for City<br /><br />It was a crazy match, when one goal followed another. I think, in any case, Monaco are not a team with the experience or the maturity to allow them to manage a result. And that is what brings them their strength and flair. It’s why they can still qualify</p>

  <p><b>[Gerard Houllier has claimed that If Paris Saint-Germain had ousted Barcelona from the Champions League, they could have gone all the way in the competition]</b> I’m certain that if PSG had gone through, this would have given them a great kick and they could have won the Champions League. When I saw them in the tunnel, I felt there was fear in their faces. And fear immobilises you.<br /><br />Barcelona’s media work functioned perfectly: the players said nothing in the first week, then in the second it was: ‘You never know, we’ve already scored five against Real Madrid’. Then it became: ‘We’re going to do it’, like Luis Suarez in France Football. There is a sort of self-hypnosis on something almost impossible. They built an image in the head of the PSG players. They were all frozen. But I also saw Brazil lose four goals in six minutes against Germany in 2014</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette has been compared to Arsenal legend Ian Wright by Gerard Houllier after completing a £46 million transfer to England]</b> He is very mobile, very quick, good in short spaces, has good skill and he scores goals. He was the top scorer in France in 2014-15, the best player in the league in 2015 and has been the best French scorer over the last three seasons. He scores more than 25 goals every season. One thing he will bring to Arsenal is goals. His main asset is to score goals. He has good technique, is good at using short spaces and is a hard-working player. He can attack, he can defend quickly. I’m not surprised Arsene fancied him. He will fit in their game. He will suit their passing game, the way they build up, their approach. He is very good near the box. He is a bit like Ian Wright really. You don’t seem to see him and then suddenly he moves.</p>

  <p><b>[Houllier excited about Liverpool v PSG clash]</b> My heart is Liverpudlian, always. Does that answer your question?!<br /><br />It will come in due time, I am sure. And once it comes, it will be a relief for the whole club, giving them the confidence to go on and win more. We had it when we won the League Cup in 2001. We had not won a trophy for six years I think, but after that we knew we could do it, we believed we could. It takes a bit of pressure off your shoulders and gives you confidence to go and fight for the other cups<br /><br />They have bought good players. They have gone and fixed their problems. They needed a goalkeeper and they bought one, they needed a centre-back and they bought one. They wanted more strength and skill in midfield and they bought Keita and Fabinho. The team is improving gradually. I read in the paper that even Gary Neville has admitted they have a good chance of winning trophies, so they must be doing something right!<br /><br />It could be like a Champions League final really! What is fascinating will be the amount of attacking quality on show, from both teams. PSG have Di Maria, Cavani and Mbappe, not to mention Neymar, while Liverpool have Salah, Firmino and Mane. It’s an incredible group of players, and there is so much pace on display with the likes of Mbappe and Mane in particular. Both teams have the talent to make it a wonderful game of football<br /><br />They have had a good enough team to have won a Champions League. But they have missed their top players in the top games. They have tremendous assets, but when it has mattered they have not been able to deliver<br /><br />That may play a part, yes. I am in a good position to tell you that the Premier League is tough, probably the toughest league around. Ligue 1 is not the same. It’s mainly the intensity of the games. When you go abroad you really see the difference. You can’t relax in the Premier League<br /><br />It plays a huge part. The support will be massive and very, very vocal, and it definitely gives an advantage to Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp knows the power of a good home support, because he had that at Dortmund as well. We have seen that when Anfield is loud, Liverpool get a lift. I think it will be the same on Tuesday<br /><br />It is always special for me to go back. The city has changed a lot since I was here, but the people have not. They are so warm and welcoming, so nice. I love going there. It is great to see the club progressing, at all levels. They have improved the way the club is run, and that is now starting to show on the field<br /><br /><b>[Contenders this season]</b> I think it will be the usual suspects. Barcelona, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Juventus … .And Liverpool, of course!</p>

  <p><b>[Why Klopp and Liverpool cannot underestimate the League Cup this season]</b> It gave us the belief. Before that, we only hoped we could become winners. After we won our first trophy, we knew we could do it. We went on to win the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup, but it started with the League Cup for us.<br /><br /><b>[Houllier, twice a League Cup winner with the Reds]</b> They’re getting better and better. They are improving year on year, and the next step now is to find a trophy. And I know from experience that once you get one, the others seem that little bit closer</p>

  <p><b>[Houllier hopeful 2019-20 season will resume]</b> I hope they will restart the competition, because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are just two wins away from a very long-awaited and deserved title. I would be very disappointed if the season ends now. Too many times have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> finished second, so now they really deserve it - even last year they finished with 97 points with one defeat<br /><br />Even if we play games behind closed doors, there will be great frustration for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans. But I can’t see them not being out in the street anyway just waiting for the players, so maybe it’s better to let them in the stadium. It’s going to be a big shame.<br /><br />We know the passion of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters and if they can’t be in the stadium to see them win it, although we understand these are unprecedented times and the health of people comes first, it would be a shame that for the first time they’re going to win the title in 30 years the fans are probably not going to be in the stadium to witness it</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager Gerard Houllier has caused a stir in France]</b> There is an axis between OM and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and it hit hard. There was an alliance made with arrangements between friends and I think above all it was a plot, a plan to eliminate <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. It will be covered up because I think the French state is involved. I followed all the press conferences by <b>[President]</b> <a href="emmanuel-macron.html">Emmanuel Macron</a> and <b>[Prime Minister]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> Philippe, and they never talked about sport.

  <p><b>[Gerard Houllier says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t just win title, they’ll do so in style]</b> The DNA of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is silverware. To get the title it is a special reward for everyone. It has been a long wait of 30 years. It is a title which is a reward to the fans for their loyalty and what they have gone through. It rewards all the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters all around the world. It is a title which rewards the players and their staff. Not only will they win it, but they will do it in style with a 25-point lead at the moment which has never been seen before. In my time we were lucky to have six trophies. But <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> won the Champions League last season then the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Super Cup, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup and now this. It is just a shame to me <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans won’t be able to experience it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. The fans I hope will be disciplined enough to wait until better times to celebrate the title. I hope to be there then too, but we don’t know yet when they are going to be crowned<br /><br />He bought two players who made a huge difference - <b>[Virgil]</b> <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> and Alisson. He spotted the weak points of the team and if you look at the results since <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and Alisson have been there it is phenomenal. Even last year I would say they nearly deserved to win the title as well. They had one defeat in 38 games and had 97 points. It was just because <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> were outstanding as well and had one more point. You have to give credit, which Jurgen did, to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> who were phenomenal. City also won the title the year before with 100 points. Then the following season to have 98, that is tremendous and you have to acknowledge that.</p>
