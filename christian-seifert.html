  <p><b>[Christian Seifert explained playing the remaining matches this season without fans might become a financial necessity for all clubs to remain in business]</b> Nobody is a fan of matches behind closed doors but, for many clubs, they may be the only way to keep clubs in business. I am aware that football is viewed as a billion-dollar business. But at the centre of it all is the game itself and the 56,000 jobs dependent on it every match day. Without sponsorship and TV income, those jobs and the very existence of clubs is in danger</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga CEO Seifert: Summer transfer market set for ‘collapse’]</b> We are part of the culture in the country, people long to get back a short piece of normal life, and that could mean the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> plays again. This is why we have to play our role here, and that means to support the government and to talk with the government about when we will be able to play again<br /><br />In the short term, I would say the transfer market this summer will not exist, it will collapse. Some agents will suddenly understand that they will have to work hard, or at least work; some leagues will understand that money is nothing that is coming automatically every month from heaven</p>

  <p><b>[German prime ministers claim <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> could return on May 9]</b> These are positive signals that have been sent. This gives both leagues (the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and 2.Bundesliga) an important perspective. Politics trust us, and we and the players in particular must now be role models. This has a lot to do with hygiene measures and exemplary handling of social contacts. It is important to be disciplined, not only for the employer, but also for the fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga resumption without fans not ideal but necessary]</b> Today’s decision is good news for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and the 2. <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. It is associated with a great responsibility for the clubs and their employees to implement the medical and organisational requirements in a disciplined manner. Games without stadium spectators are not an ideal solution for anyone. However, during a crisis, which threatens the very existence of some clubs, it is the only way to preserve the leagues in their present form. I would like to thank the political decision-makers at the state and federal levels for placing their confidence in us</p>

  <p><b>[German football chief determined to press on despite Dresden quarantine]</b> I found out about it this afternoon. It is precisely the idea that corona cases will be forwarded to the health department and they will then talk about the appropriate measures, and we have already said that we have to prepare for this. I have not spoken to any responsible person. It’s 14 days in quarantine and then we’ll have to see how we’re going to run the Dynamo Dresden games next week<br /><br />The medical experts followed the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute. And the sports ministers also advocated that quarantine should be announced in the event of positive cases. We always said: this is decided by the local health authorities. At the moment I wish it could have gone differently, of course, but it was clear that this could happen. For the second division it means that two games will be cancelled at the moment, but we are not changing the goal, the only plan is still to finish the season. It does not yet mean that the 2.<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> cannot continue, because only two games have been affected so far, but it is clear that, if it happens enough, it would no longer be possible to end the season</p>

If we could start the league on our own resources and without asking the state for money, then why not do it? On top of that, Germany loves football - 80 million people had the virus in their heads, so we helped to forget it a little bit. We just want to be treated like any other industry</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Seifert has revealed <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> restart following coronavirus shutdown was necessary for clubs’ survival]</b> I’m responsible for 36 small and large companies that had their activity interrupted and needed to restart. To have no income for two months is dangerous. A lot of those companies are 100 years old, so I had to guarantee their survival.
