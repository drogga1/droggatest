<blockquote>
  <p>Amal Clooney, the barrister wife of the Hollywood actor George Clooney, will meet with nine men – known as the ‘hooded men’ – who are bringing a legal action against the UK Government<br /><br />The ‘hooded men’ allege they were tortured when they were held without trial in Northern Ireland after the Government introduced internment in August 1971 following repeated outbreaks of serious disorder in Northern Ireland.<br /><br />The men’s claims are being backed by the Irish government<br /><br />Jim McIlmurray, a historian who is coordinating the legal action, said important documents had been uncovered which showed that Edward Heath, then prime minister, had full knowledge of the torture policy employed against the detainees. He said that the legal team, including Mrs Amal Clooney, was now analysing the documents, which had been misfiled with the Ulster Defence Regiment by the UK Government. They had recently been uncovered.</p>
