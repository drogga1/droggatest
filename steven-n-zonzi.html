  <p>[Steven N’Zonzi has aired his regret at having seen Sevilla knock back interest from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2017] It would have been nice. They [PSG] have a great team. I would have played in Ligue 1. After that, I’m Parisian, and like all Parisians, it’s nice to play for your hometown team. It would have been a good thing, but it did not happen.<br /><br />I really like the Premier League, this is where I started at a good level. I had a great time there. I don’t know what is going to happen in the future<br /><br />It’s a dream for everyone to go to the World Cup. When you’re little you think about things like this. After that, if you think too much about the future, you lose focus</p>

  <p>[Ganso - The cult hero eyeing a revival in Ligue 1] Technically, he’s one of the best players I’ve ever worked with. He’s the Brazilian stereotype epitomised; he can change a game all by himself. We shouldn’t underestimate Amiens. It’s a good club that likes to relaunch players, so he will be able to flourish.</p>
