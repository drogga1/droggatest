  <p>[Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton hopes he has done enough to force his way back into the England squad] That’s hopefully the first marker. It’s obviously out of my hands but we will see what happens<br /><br />[Quizzed on whether he has been monitoring the form of others ahead of the latest squad announcement] To be honest, no. I try to be quite intrinsic. I’m a big believer in it’s about what you do, not what anybody else does. The way football is these days and everything around it, you sometimes do well to avoid it. But in terms of my focus, it tends to be very internal. Even when I wasn’t playing and being part of the goalkeeping department here, for me it’s not about others, it’s about yourself. If you’re not playing, if you haven’t got the opportunity to go out there and play, then get better and spend time improving. I always try and look at it myself and make sure I’m doing everything I can<br /><br />They have been really impressive. The World Cup was superb. I thought the performances and the whole feel of it was excellent. There was a really good feeling in the country and everyone got behind that. We’ll certainly be looking to carry that on into the March internationals and again into the Nations League in the summer</p>

  <p>[Joe Hart had been looking for a move to Burnley to reignite his career] Massively. I’ve known him for a long time and had an excellent relationship with him. I thought his performances in the first half of the season were excellent. For me, he was probably the standout player in that first half of the season. Obviously the results weren’t going as well and the manager made a change, but he can certainly be proud of what he produced. It’s just the nature of football sometimes that results dictate things.<br /><br />We’ve got a strong goalkeeping department. We’ve got Adam Legzdins, Anders Lindegaard as well, a healthy goalkeeping dynamic. It’s good. We have a great working relationship, we all get on well and like competing against each other. Everyone wants to play, that’s a given, but I think there is an understanding that decision comes down to the manager and we’re all just putting the work in. It’s nice competing against them, but obviously frustrating when you’re not playing because that’s what everyone wants. Everyone is aware of the situation. We all want to play and be out there, but at the same time there is a support and respect there when that’s not the case. It’s a really healthy competition that can only benefit the club</p>

  <p>[Manchester United’s David de Gea remains slightly ahead of his rivals] It’s a difficult one. It’s obviously tight. I still lean on David de Gea. It’s all down to opinion. For me, he’s just got that extra something in terms of keeping the ball out of the net. He’s still very good with his feet, but the saves he produces in big moments probably puts him slightly ahead of everyone else, in my eyes.<br /><br />After what was a difficult start, at a place like Old Trafford, to put in the performances that he has put in consistently over the last few years has been tremendous. Hats off to him. He’s certainly shown his quality</p>

  <p>[Record-breaking deals for Kepa Arrizabalaga and Alisson highlight how important goalkeepers have become] No, to be honest! I think that was probably a stretch to have pre-empted that. I think it’s a sign of the importance teams putting on the goalkeeper and how they play and how much of an important piece of the puzzle they are. There have been some big-money goalkeepers recently. It’s probably a sign of the times and the importance of it, but it has certainly got to astronomical levels<br /><br />[Pressed on whether asking prices are the result of a Neymar-influenced market or the value of a proven No.1] A bit of both. There are probably two factors in it. The market has obviously got bigger and perhaps also there is an element of people seeing and understanding how they want to play and how important the goalkeeper is in that. It’s a general effect of the market getting inflated and more so the realisation of how important a goalkeeper is.<br /><br />The last few years, I think it’s been revolutionised to a degree - you look at the likes of Ederson, Kepa at Chelsea, Alisson at Liverpool. These possession-based teams, they are really raising the bar in terms of playing with their feet. It’s certainly moving in that direction. I still think the importance of keeping the ball out of the net is the priority, but that’s certainly a close second now. It’s going towards how teams want to play and how much emphasis they want to put on it. I think you’ll probably see a move towards teams picking goalkeepers based on that style. I always think that if you’ve got one team that is possession-based then the other has got to be an out-of-possession team, that’s the way they are going to have to play, so it’s going to need two different styles of goalkeepers in a game like that. There is a possibility that it has been overplayed to a certain extent but as things move forward, the biggest thing is still keeping the ball out of the back of the net. Everything else is secondary<br /><br />[Quizzed on whether being good on the ball is something he has worked on over the course of his career] It is. It is certainly something that the bar has been raised in terms of standard. You look at some goalkeepers now and they could almost play outfield in their respective teams. They are certainly setting the standard and have raised the bar in the last few years. Everyone is probably playing catch up and I would put myself in that bracket. It’s something I enjoy doing, I enjoy improving when it’s a possibility</p>
