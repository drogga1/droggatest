  <p><b>[The new <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a>? Hannibal Mejbri backed to make <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> breakthrough as he’s compared to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> star]</b> I believe he has what it takes to make it to the first team, I think he is on the right path. With humility, work, patience and the help of God, he will evolve in the first team. That’s something he greatly deserves. Hannibal was a very good player and a very mature boy from a young age. From the beginning of his time at Paris FC, we admired his football qualities. He had personality and effectiveness. He was always smiling, very polite and very well-mannered. That was due to a very good education from his parents. He was a player who was eager to learn and very demanding<br /><br />His football strengths are mainly based on his ability to see things before others. On a football field he has intelligence far above the average. In addition to this, he has a lot of technical ability and is a modern midfielder who is capable of combining excellent recovery of the ball, fast transitioning and the ability to finish<br /><br />From the earliest age he had the charisma and personality. He was already giving out instructions and he was often captain<br /><br />Today when compared to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player, I see it as <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a>. Like Hannibal, he is French, from French training, and grew up in the Paris region. His playing style is similar to what Hannibal can do in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in the coming years<br /><br />Paris FC is one of the best clubs in the Paris region in terms of training, with quality players in each team where he could evolve. Myself and other coaches have tried to give him the best possible training so that he can have the best background and it can be used for the rest of his career. I’m sure he will have the success he greatly deserves</p>
