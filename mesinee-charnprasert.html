<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Many people who participated in Sunday’s event though the three politicians (Uttama <a href="uttama-savanayana.html">Savanayana</a>, Suvit Maesincee, and Sontirat Sontijirawong) came to the event in their capacity as ministers]</b> I think by doing this <b>[coming to meet and listen to villagers]</b> the politicians will get access to the electorate. These are people who feel that they are voiceless. As long as they can fix problems as they promised, it doesn’t bother me whether it is an election campaign meeting or not<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether she thinks Palang Pracharath had gained a head start in the election because its members are cabinet ministers, she said that fairness does not exist, and that although other parties are barred from engaging in political activities, they can still do so indirectly]</b> I think each party has their own strategy, and everybody needs to do what they need to do. Other parties can beat around the bush as well if they want to do it</p>
