  <p><b>[Aizawl FC will win the league for the first time in their history if they manage to get themselves at least a point from the game]</b> We are going to go ahead with the game but we will keep a strict vigil on the referees. We are not happy with the situation but we did not want to deny our fans who live and breathe football a chance to see their team win the title. We will keep fighting this injustice from the AIFF after the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC threaten fast until death and worldwide protests over uncertain future]</b> We have already written to the AIFF claiming a place in the new merged new league. Till now we’ve received no response. Being the champions in the top national league, if any team is demoted to the 2nd division, naturally that will invite protests of all kinds. Anything can happen.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about several quotes attributed to AIFF General Secretary Kushal Das where he says Aizawl will have to play in the second division]</b> I don’t know if they <b>[quotes]</b> are genuine or not, but from his statement, there is every likelihood that Aizawl will be relegated to the 2nd division. This is in spite of Aizawl being newly crowned champions in the national league<br /><br /><b>[He then went on to list the contingency plans Aizawl have already chalked up]</b> We will have people fasting unto death. Because there will already be big processions in Yangon <b>[Myanmar]</b> and in and around FIFA headquarters, even in Maryland of USA. A list of volunteers have already submitted their names. We also have protests targeting the AFC headquarters <b>[Kuala Lumpur]</b>. Even many fans in other cities of India are united for our cause<br /><br />Our initial line of action is to appeal to the AIFF to enable Aizawl FC to remain in the new merged entity. We hope AIFF will do the needful to prevent Aizawl’s exclusion from the top division. If that request isn’t heard in the correct manner, then we are planning to meet Mr. Praful Patel, the AIFF President, and alongside the Sports Minister and Prime Minister of India to apprise them of our grievances<br /><br />We are keeping in touch with the Governor and chief minister of Mizoram and also the Governor of Nagaland who is a patron of Aizawl, Mr. Padmanabha Acharya. And I am planning to appeal to all Members of Parliament <b>[MPs]</b> from North-East to support the cause of Aizawl FC. For the sake of Justice and fairness in the football league. If none these methods work, we will approach the Asian Football Confederation <b>[AFC]</b>. My friends are there in the AFC and they will make arrangements for meeting between the AFC president and the officials of Aizawl FC<br /><br />And Finally, if these means of requests aren’t working we will resort to protests, in the form of hunger strike, processions, barring of cities. These protests will not only happen in India but all over the world. Aizawl FC has a large chain of network and activism. Europe, America and other major countries. Aizawl has a huge following outside India viz. Rangoon and Manila <b>[Philippines]</b>. They are very keen to have a big procession and protest about the exclusion of Aizawl FC if it happens</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[AIFF League Committee stalls decision on number of foreign players]</b> In my personal opinion, it would have been better if the subsidies were further hiked by 20 percent since clubs like us from the Northeast incur more expenses when travelling for away games while trying to simultaneously improve our infrastructure. If our local state governments can help us by funding our stadium upgrades, why not the AIFF.</p>
