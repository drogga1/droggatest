  <p><b>[Gabriel Magalhaes reveals <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> admiration amid talk of £30m <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> bid]</b> He was a great player without a doubt. He is one of those players that I admired on the small screen. But we have to be calm with all this. It is early and I renewed my contract with <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> until 2023. The focus now is to return to play and end the season at a high level, and qualifying <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> for the 2020-21 Champions League<br /><br />I follow it, but I try to stay apart from it. I always tell my managers that, at this moment, I want to know as little as possible so as not to lose focus on the pitch. I am happy to see my name being linked with great teams. It shows that the work I’ve done so far has been good. I also see many fans of the two teams commenting on my posts on Instagram. It’s funny</p>

  <p><b>[Rumoured <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> target Gabriel Magalhaes has opened the door to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> move]</b> It is gratifying because there are a lot of teams talking about me. I want to go as high as possible, I came to Europe for that. England or Italy? Both are good championships. I speak a lot to <a href="luis-campos.html">Luis Campos</a> to see where it is best for me because he has a lot of experience. I also speak with my agents, with <a href="gerard-lopez.html">Gerard Lopez</a>, with <a href="jose-fonte.html">Jose Fonte</a>. <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a> <b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s manager]</b> likes me a lot? I don’t know, we haven’t talked. On the internet, on social networks, there are a lot of things coming out. I do not know what is true. I see every day, ‘ah Gabriel goes there, then there’. But in fact, we don’t know yet where I’m going to go. Wherever I go it will be to play, to be at the top, at the highest level. And above all in a team that will allow me to go to the Selecao. This is my big goal, my dream. I hope that I will be there soon.<br /><br />I have progressed a lot. Especially in the passes between the lines. Before, I didn’t do it too much. But today the big defenders are players who know how to break the lines, who know how to look for space, find the depth. I’ve progressed a lot on this aspect. Now I have to score more goals. If I knew what was going to happen, I would not be lying to you. But I don’t know, so I’m waiting.</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel signed a new deal with <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> in January until 2023, and he has already responded to reports linking him with a move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I just renewed the contract. I heard about conversations, I saw things on websites in England, but I have my head in <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>. I’m very calm to finish the season well and to achieve great things next season</p>
