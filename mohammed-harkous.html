  <p><b>[Mohammed Harkous outperforms 31 other players at the event at London’s O2 Arena to take home the title and top prize of $250,000 (£205,600)]</b> It’s crazy, I can’t believe it. I had such a hard bracket but I beat them all</p>

  <p><b>[With just one minute and extra time remaining, Nicolas Villalba managed to slip into the box and score yet another. He needed just one more goal to force extra time in the PlayStation final]</b> I thought I had won. I was 5-2 up but he scored such a lucky goal to equalise that I thought EA didn’t want me to win. My coach woke me up because I felt like I was out and I managed to secure my spot on penalties, which was not an easy 30 mins as he was so motivated</p>

  <p><b>[The world’s best FIFA players give their first impressions of FIFA 20]</b> Of course I’m happy timed finishing and moving the goalkeeper will remain in FIFA 20. It’s so important for the skill-gap. For tournaments, it’s so hard to hit green while you’re under pressure - it’s a skill and any skill expression is always good in FIFA. I think all the complaints about not moving the goalkeeper good or not timing your shots good, you have to learn it. You can’t say in football you’re not allowed to cross good because I can’t defend it so you have to learn</p>

I started well at the tournament on Friday. I was defending well and when I do that, I can beat everyone and this time I showed it</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> world champion Mohammed ‘MoAuba’ Harkous fell in love with the game as most young boys do - while playing against his brother]</b> The old times were playing with my brother when I was seven or eight, I always played a lot and it was so much fun for me to play <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. In the moment I thought I was dreaming because I didn’t expect it. It was funny because I didn’t expect to make the final so I didn’t practice on Xbox, I play maybe one game a year on Xbox so it was not easy to do - the controller is as big as my hand! This tournament was perfect for me. I did well and I’m really happy. I think I needed that win. I’ve won five championships in Germany but internationally I was always close and now I have the confidence to hopefully win more tournaments<br /><br />The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> eWorld Cup is special because it’s coming towards the end of a <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> so I didn’t practice a lot before I played - maybe four games in one week, so like one hour. For the World Cup you have to play your game because it’s not easy, you’re under so much pressure and everyone is nervous. You need to be relaxed and it’s not important to practice a lot - it’s important to perform in that moment<br /><br /><b>[Performing on the big stage is something that comes naturally to MoAuba]</b> I always enjoy it when there’s such a big crowd or viewership. I always play better than when I play alone at home. When 50 million viewers are online you want to show what you can do - score good goals and play good passes<br /><br />I played as a striker and I had the same hair as <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> so my team-mates always called my <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>. Now I’ve lost my hair like an old man<br /><br />I think if I meet <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> it will be special because your friends are watching and saying ‘wow, he got a photo with him! It’s crazy if I get to meet them and I will enjoy it. In real life I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best ever because he’s a complete player<br /><br /><b>[The slightest gameplay tweak is capable of unsettling some, but the new <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> champion is confident his skills will translate to the next edition]</b> I’m nervous and excited about how the next game is but I think I’m one of the best players to adapt always because I can play fast or slow. I know how to deal with it and I think I don’t have to worry about the game. But each year you need a bit of luck that the game suits you. Like this year the game was perfect for me because it was quite balanced<br /><br /><b>[Having already got his hands on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20, MoAuba believes it will require some patience but with the addition of Volta, says it strikes a good balance]</b> It’s a bit slower and less fast than the old game. You have to be more tactical. Volta looks like a fun game for casuals so you have a good balance</p>
