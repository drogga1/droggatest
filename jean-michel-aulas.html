  <p><b>[Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas says the club are 48 hours away from completing a complicated deal for Manchester United winger Memphis Depay]</b> For the moment, we are in agreement in principle but we still need to write the contract up, which is a bit complicated because there are a fair amount of bonuses. It was big operation, because it will be worth around €16.5m <b>[£14.3m]</b> plus €8m <b>[£6.9m]</b> in bonuses. This is a big investment. Manchester United bought him from PSV for €34m plus €8m. I believe that a certain amount of the bonuses are due to PSV following a transfer. There is a whole load of literature to be written and that is what is happening between both clubs at the moment. But we are used to working with Manchester United, they are a very structured club who, generally, stick to their word. We worked with them for the arrival of Rafael, a little while earlier. It is in progress, but I think it will require another 48 hours for him to be registered.<br /><br />It was a dream, because he corresponds exactly with the player we were looking for. In addition, he has a certain panache. It is true that Jose Mourinho did not play him that much, so there was an opportunity that we took when we negotiated with the representatives of Manchester United</p>

I want him to know that if he makes an offer for Alexandre at least equal to that of the other clubs bidding for him, then Alex can go to Paris without problem. I am a businessman and a modern club president. Transfer money must be reinvested into French football, as I always did when we were at the peak of our powers. When transfer money is shared abroad, it strengthens our competitors instead.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal target Alexandre Lacazette could leave the club this summer]</b> Today, the question of Alexandre leaving is annoying. For us, he won’t leave. he’ll be there for pre-season. Anyway, he’s under contract. Alexandre knows our position. If he wants to try his hand somewhere else, there must be offers, which have gone straight to him. For the moment, I have no others. I don’t know if he wants to leave. Maybe he’ll give me a call. The ideal scenario would be that he stays and the goals we’ve set.</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas admits Arsenal are ready to pay for Alexandre Lacazette]</b> I do not intend to sell Alexandre quickly, because there is always the option of Atletico Madrid to signing him on January 1, 2018. I also listen to what Alexandre says. I saw Arsene during the match between France and England. I was with Gerard Houllier <b>[Lyon advisor]</b> and I understand he <b>[Wenger]</b> told Gerard that there could be an interest from Arsenal. But it is premature to say that things will be done. We cannot let a player of that quality go without his replacement. We are talking about €50m <b>[£43.7m]</b> to €60m <b>[£52.5m]</b>.<br /><br />Everyone knows Atletico were going to pay €53m <b>[£46.4m]</b> plus €12m <b>[£10.5m]</b> in add-ons. That’s €65m <b>[£56.9m]</b>. The Arsenal executives are well informed, they will be in those waters. The price for a player who scores, every year, between 25 and 30 goals, sometimes more than 30, is at least that. But frankly, I have not thought about Arsenal for the moment, because I thought that Alexandre would stay because of the failure, initially, with Atletico Madrid.</p>

His arrival and the departure of Mariano will be connected. Moussa Dembele is a target, yes. But I also read that Marseille were on it. Is it harder for them than for us? Yes, I think so.

  <p><b>[Lyon will have to sell one of their star trio Nabil Fekir, Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar this summer]</b> We will only let one player go from those solicited. I do not know which one because there are many who have been solicited. It will take a big, big effort to try to convince Nabil, our world champion from the academy, to stay when he was almost sure he could go. We made a big effort to convince Nabil who is our world champion, when he was announced on the start. I’ll be honest, it’s easier for us to let go of Depay for example. Players like Houssem are programmed to leave from a big team of Lyon. After 32 years of experience, I can say that these kind of players are the future of this club. It’s easier, of course <b>[to let Memphis go than Aouar]</b>. Houssem is scheduled to be part of the European Championship team which will be, for sure, playing in Lyon in the coming years. But the conditions of the offers and the desire of the players must always be taken into account. After 32 years of experience, I always know that it’s not my own desires that are chosen when it comes to transfers.<br /><br />Bruno Genesio’s priority is to stay, he is an asset. No, <b>[my decision]</b> has not been made, otherwise I would have told him, which would have avoided this indecision. I will have an interview with Bruno before the game against Barcelona to tell him the substance of my thought so that we have all the assets to go to Camp Nou and that there is not this useless pressure. And in any case Bruno is a good coach<br /><br /><b>[Lyon held Barcelona to a goalless draw in the first leg of their last-16 clash]</b> The ideal scenario against Barca is to score a goal.

  <p><b>[Tanguy Ndombele has been heavily linked with Manchester rivals City and United]</b> It wouldn’t be any problem. I would be proud of it. If PSG wants to buy Tanguy Ndombele there is no problem. There is no unhealthy quarrel with the PSG leaders. Nasser Al Khelaifi is a loyal and brilliant man whom I admire.<br /><br />I am not in favour of state funds taking control of a football club. With PSG and Manchester City, a form of unfair competition has set in and I would like the institutions that regulate football to be interested in this subject in order to preserve sport and economic equity. Football clubs must remain in the hands of private investors in the name of sporting equality<br /><br />Player transfers have become a recurring activity for the football club, whereas in the past this element wasn’t as prominent. It’s a key part of our business model. Especially since Olympique Lyonnais is one of the top European clubs in terms of player development. For example, the French Under-19 team has six players from Olympique Lyonnais. The sale of our players in the coming years will continue the process</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> president Aulas criticises <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> for ending season early amid coronavirus]</b> We contest this decision on three points. The stoppage of the league was decided by the LFP based on a certain number of pieces of information that were not decreed by the French government, notably with the recent statements from the minister for sport <b>[Roxana Maracineanu]</b>, on being able to play behind closed doors and in front of less than 5,000 people.<br /><br />We find that the LFP moved very quickly to stop the league. We put together a number of other scenarios, with playoffs that could have interested a number of TV broadcasters. I don’t want to attack one club more than another but Nice <b>[who finished fifth]</b> played more home games than us and played <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> once, while <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> played them twice. This is not a decision without consequences, like for the amateur clubs. There are considerable things at stake. Over the course of the last 10 years, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> made up ground at least three times on the second placed side when there was a situation of being more than 10 points behind them.<br /><br />This is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value. We are going to claim damages, that are worth several dozen million Euros. <a href="noel-le-graet.html">Noel Le Graet</a> has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions. The relationship with the TV broadcasters was surprising. The governance during this period was questionable, almost all the presidents of the clubs think that. There are a number of things that should not have happened and we will not be leaving it there</p>
