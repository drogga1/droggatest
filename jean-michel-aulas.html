  <p><b>[President Jean-Michel Aulas on Nabil Fekir]</b> With the condition of his knee and the problem with Liverpool, it’s going to be difficult for Lyon to get €60m. But with this Lyon side, set up to maximise Fekir, they can do it. When he’s in shape, he’s an extraordinary player. Juninho can revive him. Fekir, at his usual level, is a very good player and Lyon must keep him instead of selling for €20m. He’s a Champions League player and it’s important to have someone like that to count on his qualities.<br /><br />Nabil could leave, but not under just any conditions. We’re not in a Care Bear world, we know there’s only a year left on his contract so it won’t be the same price if there were four or five, as was the case with Ndombele. We’re in discussions with people who are not in a hurry to get a deal done because they want to negotiate well. But we don’t need money. And we want to keep him if we can’t find someone to replace him.</p>

  <p><b>[Jean-Michel Aulas says Lyon will look to reopen contract negotiations with Nabil Fekir if he fails to find a new home]</b> Nabil has entered the final year of his contract so there may be a temptation for <b>[interested]</b> clubs to let the situation drag on. We’re strong enough economically to wait. It would be very good news if he doesn’t find a club of a suitable size, since we would then enter negotiations <b>[about a new contract]</b><br /><br /><b>[Aulas promised not to put up any roadblocks if a bid reflecting his value is received]</b> With Nabil and the players who preceded him, I have always respected their deepest wish. He says that he wants to leave but maybe he will stay, and at that point we will try to agree an extension. Sometimes unfair things happen in football and sometimes the conditions for a transfer are not met. Nabil deserves a club to match his level and if he does not find it we will be very happy to try to extend his contract]&lt;/b&gt;</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon president Aulas wants play-offs to finish abandoned <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> season]</b> The big sporting affairs cannot occur before September. The 2019-20 professional football season cannot return. I read carefully what <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> said, they wanted us to go all the way to the end of the competitions, even if we might have to play on a reduced format and in August.<br /><br />So, I think there is an alternative way which would consist of supplementing this end of the championship with a series of play-offs for the top and for the bottom which would take place in August, perhaps even in July behind closed doors.<br /><br />Do not rush. I tell myself that, perhaps, in the deconfinement rules that have been proposed, there is still room to finish the championship</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon president Aulas criticises <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> for ending season early amid coronavirus]</b> We contest this decision on three points. The stoppage of the league was decided by the LFP based on a certain number of pieces of information that were not decreed by the French government, notably with the recent statements from the minister for sport <b>[Roxana Maracineanu]</b>, on being able to play behind closed doors and in front of less than 5,000 people.<br /><br />We find that the LFP moved very quickly to stop the league. We put together a number of other scenarios, with playoffs that could have interested a number of TV broadcasters. I don’t want to attack one club more than another but Nice <b>[who finished fifth]</b> played more home games than us and played <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> once, while <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> played them twice. This is not a decision without consequences, like for the amateur clubs. There are considerable things at stake. Over the course of the last 10 years, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> made up ground at least three times on the second placed side when there was a situation of being more than 10 points behind them.<br /><br />This is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value. We are going to claim damages, that are worth several dozen million Euros. <a href="noel-le-graet.html">Noel Le Graet</a> has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions. The relationship with the TV broadcasters was surprising. The governance during this period was questionable, almost all the presidents of the clubs think that. There are a number of things that should not have happened and we will not be leaving it there</p>

I noted almost 10 European countries where training has started again. So, we can really wonder. By adapting our methods, we could probably have finished the Championship. As long as there is life, there is hope.
