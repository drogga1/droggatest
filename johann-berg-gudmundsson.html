  <p><b>[Burnley winger Johan Berg Gudmondssen tells the Nordic island nation could surprise a few on their World Cup debut this summer]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is one of the best, if not the best, who ever touched the ball, so it’s going to be nice to test yourself against him. We know it’s going to be tough, we’re going to be defending 95 per cent of the time but that five per cent when we play a little bit of football we may nick a goal and surprise a few people. We know we’re playing Argentina, we have to think about our game, how we’re going to stop them and how we’re going to make their day difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Johann Berg Gudmundsson on his new three-year contract]</b> This season has been a good season for myself and the team and being rewarded with a new contract is a great thing. It’s something I wanted to do. I want to stay here. I feel comfortable here and my family likes it here, so I definitely wanted to sign a new contract</p>

  <p><b>[Johann Berg Gudmundsson on Kylian Mbappe]</b> He is definitely special. He is the quickest player that I have ever seen play, and I have played against <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Christiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. His pace is something different to those two. I think he will become the best player in the world in a couple of years, I have no doubt about that</p>

  <p><b>[Gudmundsson says he was frustrated after Hammers defeat]</b> It was tough, we gave away a few silly goals but showed some character in coming back into it. I think we should have used the momentum better when we came back twice, but we didn’t and we got punished. That’s frustrating. When you come back, normally the momentum is with you but we didn’t use that and that’s the disappointing part<br /><br /><b>[But despite making it 1-1 right on half-time with a deft clip beyond Lukasz Fabianski from Ashley Westwood’s pass, he wasn’t in the mood to celebrate afterwards]</b> It was a good goal, a great ball from Westy (Ashley Westwood) and a good finish. I’m glad to score but it doesn’t mean anything. Hopefully <b>[I’m starting to come up with more goals]</b>, as long as I’m scoring goals and they mean something, I’m happy. But they don’t really mean anything when you lose the game</p>
