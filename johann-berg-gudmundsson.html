  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> winger Johan Berg Gudmondssen tells the Nordic island nation could surprise a few on their World Cup debut this summer]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is one of the best, if not the best, who ever touched the ball, so it’s going to be nice to test yourself against him. We know it’s going to be tough, we’re going to be defending 95 per cent of the time but that five per cent when we play a little bit of football we may nick a goal and surprise a few people. We know we’re playing Argentina, we have to think about our game, how we’re going to stop them and how we’re going to make their day difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Johann Berg Gudmundsson on his new three-year contract]</b> This season has been a good season for myself and the team and being rewarded with a new contract is a great thing. It’s something I wanted to do. I want to stay here. I feel comfortable here and my family likes it here, so I definitely wanted to sign a new contract</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe is the heir to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the best player in the world]</b> He is definitely special. He is the quickest player that I have ever seen play, and I have played against Ronaldo and Messi. His pace is something different to those two. Obviously, Ronaldo is quick, but it is the turn of pace that is something no other player has got, and to control the ball at that speed is something special. I think he will become the best player in the world in a couple of years, I have no doubt about that. It is unbelievable that he is just 19 and what he has done in the last year, to be honest. He has already done so many things. He is only going to get better, as long as his head is right and he stays humble, I think he will be the best player in the world.<br /><br />I never thought I could play in the World Cup with Iceland, definitely not. You always dream but it never crossed my mind that I would be able to do it. It is definitely something special and it is a memory that will be tough to beat in my career. But I think we are still always the underdogs. It is always going to be something magical when we get to a big tournament, even though we have done it twice in a row now. We are still the small Iceland. We don’t have the best players in the world but we are a great team here.<br /><br />We do put more expectations on ourselves now. We have done it twice and we want to do it again. It is definitely something you want to do again as a player. We always put pressure on ourselves but people outside expect more so we may have to adapt to that. You saw it a little bit when we lost the last two games. When we lost 6-0 <b>[to Belgium]</b>, people thought the party was over and all that. I think when the qualifiers start for Euro 2020 that people will expect us to do well and go there. That’s fine with us because we want the same thing. We want to go to big tournaments and give the nation that enjoyment again. To play in these big tournaments. We know the nation gets behind us.<br /><br />Just to play in the World Cup was the best experience. To be there, play with these great players. Obviously, we didn’t win a game, which was extremely disappointing, apart from the draw against Argentina in the first game which was a massive thing for us. To play against Messi was something I hadn’t done before, which was nice as well. Just to be on the pitch and be able to say forever that you are one of the people who has played at the World Cup is something I will never forget. To be part of Icelandic history is fantastic<br /><br />It is just hard work <b>[that has got him back to his best]</b>. He is an extremely hard-working player with a lot of quality and I always knew he was going to bounce back from a few games that he didn’t play well in. But he is a fantastic player, with fantastic quality who works extremely hard. I always knew he would be back to his best. Over the last few games, he has been one of the best players in the Premier League. He has that quality though and shown that. It was an unbelievable goal and one of his best. It was a joy to watch. He has got that in him, it all comes from practice.<br /><br />When he was younger, he was always out there every day after training practising that. There’s no coincidence and there’s always a reason. If you have done the things that Gylfi has done, then you can produce fantastic moments. We met each other at 12 or 13, we have been good friends since then. We live close to each other in Manchester. We have always been best mates and it is also just nice to play with good players. He is a good player and our chemistry on the pitch is good. It is good for Iceland. That’s the special thing about this group. Five of these players are my best mates and to do it with your nation in Iceland together in big tournaments, it is all a dream come true</p>

  <p><b>[De Bruyne and Eden Hazard the Premier League’s best]</b> It was a big moment for me <b>[to score that goal]</b> because City at that moment, and probably still are, the best team in England. Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard are up there as the top players who I enjoy to watch in the Premier League. At left-back, I thought Alonso was quite tough because he goes up and down all time, he is difficult to track. I haven’t yet played against <b>[Benjamin]</b> Mendy but he looks like a really good player.<br /><br />I’ve been playing really well and I have obviously set up a few goals. My game at the moment is in a good place and it is nice when people pick it up and talk about. It is still early days and only a few games in. I want to keep this up for the whole season to get more goals and assists. Up until now, I am happy with how things are going but I want to keep it up throughout the season. It is just experience and at the moment I am enjoying football. My body is fine, I have no injuries and nothing to worry about. It is the team that I am in at the moment. I work well with them, I know what they expect from me and everything at the moment is in a good place, both on and off the field. I think Sean Dyche is definitely the manager who has given me the most. He gave me confidence, he made me believe that I am an established Premier League player<br /><br />His training methods are good and he will be honest with you. He tells you exactly what he wants from you so I think he is definitely the manager who has got the most out of me and I hope he can get even more out of me this season. It has shown with Burnley over the last few seasons now in how well he has done with one of the smallest budgets in the Premier League. The Dutch coaches helped me a lot as well, but I have to say Sean Dyche has been my best coach because I am playing my best football yet under him at the moment. I am extremely happy at Burnley at the moment. I signed a new contract and I am looking forward to carrying on doing well. I always wanted to play in England. I went to Charlton first in the Championship and worked my way up. I always wanted to play in the Premier League. In Iceland, it is the biggest league and the one you follow. That was always my aim and I am extremely proud that I am able to say I am a Premier League player<br /><br />In world football, I followed David Beckham in England. I watched the Premier League and English national team and he was the standout character there. I had a few idols. Obviously, for people here in Iceland, Eidur Gudjohnsen was definitely one of them. He was a fantastic player and I was lucky enough to play with him as well. He was obviously in our Euro 2016 squad as well. He was one of the players in Iceland who I definitely looked up<br /><br />My parents lived in London for work. That’s why I went to Chelsea and Fulham,” he concluded. “When I was at Fulham I tore my anterior cruciate ligament in my knee. I had an operation and after that I didn’t get offered a scholarship. My family decided to move back to Iceland. I started playing football with my friends again. I played one season in the top league in Iceland and then AZ came in and bought me from Iceland. It was a good experience though, to be in England. It was definitely difficult but at the same time it spurred me onto better things because I always wanted to be a professional footballer. Setbacks are not ideal, but they can give you some extra motivation to get you to your goal and that definitely happened for me. In the end it all worked out fine for me. If I hadn’t done my ligament, what would have happened? I don’t know. That’s just football and injuries are something you have to get used to</p>

  <p><b>[Gudmundsson says he was frustrated after Hammers defeat]</b> It was tough, we gave away a few silly goals but showed some character in coming back into it. I think we should have used the momentum better when we came back twice, but we didn’t and we got punished. That’s frustrating. When you come back, normally the momentum is with you but we didn’t use that and that’s the disappointing part<br /><br /><b>[But despite making it 1-1 right on half-time with a deft clip beyond Lukasz Fabianski from Ashley Westwood’s pass, he wasn’t in the mood to celebrate afterwards]</b> It was a good goal, a great ball from Westy (Ashley Westwood) and a good finish. I’m glad to score but it doesn’t mean anything. Hopefully <b>[I’m starting to come up with more goals]</b>, as long as I’m scoring goals and they mean something, I’m happy. But they don’t really mean anything when you lose the game</p>
