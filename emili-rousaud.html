  <p><b>[Rousaud confident of shady dealings after mass board resignations]</b> Sincerely, I think so. Who was it? I don’t think it was someone from the board. I don’t know who it was, but I can speculate.<br /><br />When you pay a million euros for something worth 100,000 euros, that could bring benefit to someone inside or outside the club. I don’t think it’s someone on the board but if there’s a discrepancy then it means someone is benefiting in an illicit way.<br /><br />With ‘SocialMediaGate’, we have three problems. The first is understanding whether the social media networks are being used to destroy others’ reputations - I don’t think that is the case.<br /><br />Secondly, is the €3 million paid for those services market price? And third, it’s unquestionable that the payments have been made in stages <b>[to circumvent the board]</b>. The issue is the fragmentation of the invoices. After the audit, we couldn’t look the other way.<br /><br />The president’s offer to step down came when the report was about the drop. It’s suspicious. The president knows what he puts in the audit and that’s one of the factors that concerns us</p>

  <p><b>[Rousaud sensationally claimed the following morning that someone was stealing from the club]</b> Sincerely, I think so. Who was it? I don’t think it was someone from the board. I don’t know who it was, but I can speculate. When you pay €1m (£0.9m/$1.1m) for something worth €100,000 (£90,000/$110,000), that could bring benefit to someone inside or outside the club. I don’t think it’s someone on the board but if there’s a discrepancy then it means someone is benefiting in an illicit way. With ‘SocialMediaGate’, we have three problems.

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> take legal action against ex-vice president <a href="emili-rousaud.html">Rousaud</a> over corruption allegations]</b> In the face of grave and unfounded allegations made by Mr <a href="emili-rousaud.html">Emili Rousaud</a>, the club’s former Vice President, in a number of media interviews, the Board of Directors categorically denies any action that could be described as corruption and have agreed to bring the corresponding criminal action accordingly. In this regard, the Board wishes to emphasise that in the light of these allegations, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC), the company in charge of conducting the audit on the monitoring services of social networks contracted by the club, have reiterated that its work is still ongoing and, therefore, is without any provisional or definitive conclusions. The Board of Directors have agreed that, once the audit is completed, it will analyse the content and conclusions derived from it, publish them, and will make their decisions and take appropriate measures based on their final result</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in ‘danger of economic bankruptcy and moral decay’]</b> For some time now the project Si al futur has been warning <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> members that the club was heading towards the ‘perfect storm’ - it had to replace the best generation of footballers in history, build and finance the Espai <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> development project and compete against corporations with almost unlimited financial resources. And all this had to be done while preserving the ownership of the club in the hands of the members and its competitive capacity both in football and in all sections. If the risks were great, they have now become gigantic. We are in the midst of a pandemic that has brought the planet to a halt and will have effects in all walks of life, also in sport, that today we cannot yet foresee. Likewise, for months we have witnessed a shameful escalation of chapters in the club’s institutional behaviour in which the latest event hides the seriousness of the previous one, a process that culminated in recent days with accusations and serious reproaches among board members, and six abrupt resignations. And just as the only priority should be to get the club out of the crisis, the presidency announces a new remodelling of the board of directors in order to stay in power. What is at risk now is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> as a whole. This is not a recent problem - we have experienced the sentencing of the club in the <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> case, the disagreements made public between employees and players with executives and managers, and the audit of the case on social networks, which seems will confirm the scandal. Let’s add an erratic sports policy, the breaking up of the board of directors and the significant reduction in income due to the pandemic, and the result is the danger of economic bankruptcy and moral decay in which the club has settled. Game over</p>

  <p><b>[Rousaud ready to go to legal war with <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>]</b> For the sole purpose of responding to the announcement made by the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> spokesperson about filing a criminal complaint against me for the statements made regarding the so-called ‘BarcaGate’ case, I want to state the following:<br /><br />1. The existence of corruption within the club is evident in the fact that it has already been shown that contracts between related companies (one based in a tax haven that violates the money laundering prevention law) have been paid in instalments in order to avoid internal controls, approval by the Adjudication Committee (which ensures purchases are made at market price) and the Board of Directors.<br /><br />2. The statements I made regarding this matter are absolutely true and demonstrable; the opinions that I have expressed are absolutely well-founded, which allows me to state that the announced complaint has no basis whatsoever.<br /><br />3. Unfortunately, when I made the club aware of these irregularities it became the cause of my resignation. However, it cannot be underestimated that there is a moral - and legal - obligation to publicly report irregular actions that may constitute crime.<br /><br />4. In this situation, I reserve the right to carry out legal actions in defence of my legitimate interests and rights, especially when considering that the announced complaint could be a crime of false accusation and a crime of insult, given its real purpose could only be to stain my personal honour. This matter is in the hands of my lawyer, Mr Diego Artacho from the DWF-RCD law firm.<br /><br />5. I have never questioned the honourability of our beloved club and its employees - on the contrary. I feel very honoured to have been able to serve my beloved <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and to have had the opportunity to meet people who work in the club with great professional and human qualities.<br /><br />6. My intention at all times has been to be consistent with my performance on the board since the beginning, with actions guided by transparency, honesty and respect, and not to disappoint the trust that was placed in the board in past elections</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a> battling Rousaud on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s transfer plans]</b> I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will reach an agreement over a renewal. To reach an agreement, the two parties must make some kind of concession, but I would be very surprised if this beautiful story did not continue for longer<br /><br />I think it’s possible that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> could return in the summer. It does not seem to me an impossibility at all. I have a feeling that the pandemic will lead to some deflation in player prices, which is good for buyers but bad for sellers. We will have to see how all these factors are rebalanced<br /><br />I haven’t lost the will to present myself but I have to think about things before making a decision. We have a year, more or less, before the start of electoral campaign and it’s a decision that I will think about - I won’t rule it out at all: I would like to be the president of Barca</p>

The coronavirus is going to provoke deflation in the transfer market and the majority of clubs will have financial problems. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will have to analyse if the operation is within the club’s finances. The interest is real, but it’s complicated. There are three parties involved: <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and the player. If the three look for an agreement, they will find the solution: payment in instalments, for example.
