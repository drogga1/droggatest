  <p><b>[Hugo Gatti says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> needs to move from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to arch-rivals <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in order to prove he is the best player in history]</b> It seems as if I am anti-Argentine, but until <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> performs in the big games, he will continue to be a player of home games. He has to have balls to go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and prove everything there like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> <b>[did]</b>. Otherwise he will be just one more <b>[player]</b>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> went to the best club in the world. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> plays at home, on his pitch with everything <b>[that comes with that in terms of home comforts]</b>. Let him perform in the Champions League and the World Cup, otherwise he will always be one more <b>[player]</b>. When he performs there, he will fight with <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> and <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> performs when they let him perform. It’s very easy to perform with everything in your favour at home</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina goalkeeper Hugo Gatti has claimed that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is no longer phenomenal]</b> I don’t care if they criticise me in Argentina. I’m very Argentinian and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a phenomenon, but he’s not a phenomenon now. They treat him wrong because they big him up and big him up and treat him wrong. He gets used to it and walks more on the pitch. He has to be better.<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> <b>[Ronaldo]</b> and him are the two best. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has to be better, he’s got used to playing at a weary rhythm, walking and those that know football think the same. Take off, kid. You have to play well. When there’s a player like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, like it was with <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> and <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, and his teammates always give the ball to him to win the game. They spoil the team and they don’t put everything they have into it. The team get used to giving him the ball and not anyone else.</p>
