<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Inter striker <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Crespo</a> sacked by Argentine club Banfield]</b> The board of directors of the Banfield Athletic Club wishes to thank <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Hernan Crespo</a> and his entire technical body for their dedication, commitment, effort and commitment throughout these nine months at the helm of our first team<br /><br />The professionalism and work demonstrated by Hernan and his team on a day-to-day basis <b>[both leading to the Primera squad and empowering our youth]</b> have been extremely satisfactory. But unfortunately, as usually happens in football even with promising projects like this, the results obtained have not been as expected and those that the club need at this time<br /><br />That is why it has been decided to end the relationship with the coach and his collaborators<br /><br />Thanking again <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Hernan Crespo</a> and his team not only for their professional skills, but also human and identification with the values of the Banfilena Family, we wish them good luck with their careers that will undoubtedly develop successfully</p>
