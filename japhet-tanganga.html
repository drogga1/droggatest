  <p><b>[Tanganga: <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> asked if I’d be scared to face Liverpool]</b> The gaffer mentioned something on Tuesday. He asked me if I want to play, I said: ‘Yeah’, he said: ‘You wont be scared?’, I said: ‘No, I wont be scared’. Then we did a bit of shape two or three days before the game and I thought: ‘Yeah I’m in the team’. The boys have been excellent, cheering me on, encouraging me and letting me know it is just another game. As much as it is my debut, as much as I am playing against probably the best team in the league right now, it doesn’t matter. They were just great, I am grateful for the manager having trust in me<br /><br /><b>[Although the centre-back was happy to make his first appearance in the English top-flight, he feels his side should have left the field with at least a point]</b> I was happy to make my debut but I really thought we could have nicked something at the end of the game. Maybe a draw, maybe a win. It means a lot. It means a lot, from young you dream about it, you see guys on TV and you think, ‘I want that’. It would have been much better if we had won the game, but I am happy to make my debut. I have made my debut now, but it has gone now. I will celebrate with my family and then it is on to the next one</p>

  <p><b>[Japhet Tanganga express his gratitude for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s decision to trust him with consecutive starts for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s senior side]</b> We had chances to kill the game but obviously you’re not always going to score but we had to defend well. It was a sloppy goal we shouldn’t have conceded it. We made it hard for ourselves. I’m just grateful that the gaffer is trusting me, the club for giving me the opportunity and my team-mates for trusting me. I’m ready for whenever the manager picks up, I’m loving it, the opportunity to play in this stadium</p>

  <p><b>[Tanganga admits to breaking down in tears ahead of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> debut vs Liverpool]</b> On the Tuesday of that week <b>[Jose Mourinho]</b> asked me: ‘Do you want to play on Saturday?’ I said yeah and he said: ‘Are you sure you won’t’ be scared?’ I said ‘nah’! He said: ‘Okay’. Then we worked on the shape in training on Wednesday and Thursday and from there I thought: ‘Okay, I’m actually playing’. Leading up to the game on Saturday I was really nervous, having sleepless nights and just thinking it could go well, it could go bad, all sorts of things were running through my head. On the day of the game when I woke up I had a bit of a tear-up, I was emotional, overwhelmed, I was finally going to make my <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut! But once I got to the stadium and did the warm-up I was switched on. I wasn’t nervous coming up against Salah or Mane, I was just focused on doing what the manager wanted me to do<br /><br />I actually didn’t grow up supporting <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> when I was a little boy. I grew up with my dad watching Man United and I always used to see them on the TV when I was young. <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> was immense. He is someone I look up to, especially with the position I play. For me, <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> was the one. But once I signed and was around here every day, I just grew to love <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I loved watching them play, going to games and seeing them, so they became my favourite team</p>

  <p><b>[Japhet Tanganga thinks it is unfair to suggest <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> does not give young players a chance]</b> Even before, I’m pretty sure that when he was at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="raphael-varane.html">Raphael Varane</a> was very young and in the team. The same at United, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> came through there. He’s the same as every manager - they want to give young players a chance but it’s up to the young player to show them they’re capable of coping in whatever league they’re in, <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> or <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. It’s not just down to the manager wanting to play you, it’s down to the young player showing the determination to the manager that they want to play as well. He has taught me a lot. In training he’s given me a lot of information, a lot of details, ways to improve. How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He’s given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half. He has really been very helpful<br /><br />In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England. For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me. All I’m doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that’s all I’m focusing on. Fikayo <b>[Tomori]</b> has done that and now I’m in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals</p>
