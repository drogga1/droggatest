  <p><b>[on Martin Vasquez]</b> Martin does a lot of the explaining. We haven’t split up too much into defense and offense, but when we have Jurgen’s been with the forwards and Martin’s been with the defenders and Andy goes back and forth.</p>

  <p><b>[Will Bruin returns to Houston having recharged his career in Seattle]</b> I just had this feeling in my gut that time had run its course on phase one of my career. I’d spent six years in Houston and I needed to challenge myself and get that fire and passion in my belly back.<br /><br /><b>[Bruin acknowledges now he needed to reinvigorate what he felt had become a stagnating career]</b> I would say that. There was a lot of turnover with coaches and stuff, and it was hard to get a full grasp of things with coaches coming in and out. That maybe played a part too because every coach has different players that they like and you can go from playing for one coach to not playing for another coach<br /><br />I think I’ve gotten more comfortable on the ball. When you see guys like Nico <b>[Lodeiro]</b> and Clint, the way they have the ball at their feet, it’s natural, they’re not worried about it. It’s like riding a bike. I think sometimes throughout my career I looked awkward when I’m dribbling, I’d try to get rid of it as soon as possible. I think just having that composure with the ball at my feet and kind of being more patient and having that confidence in my abilities has been something that playing with those guys has helped me improve on<br /><br /><b>[On Houston Dynamo]</b> They have an identity now. I think Wilmer has done a really good job of figuring out how the team’s going to play, and they’ve stuck to their style all year. That’s with pace in high, wide areas, and good and clinical finishers in the box. When I look at the Dynamo the last few years we didn’t really have an identity. I think Matt and Wilmer have done a really good job this year of forming that for them<br /><br />I just remember thinking my first year ‘Man, this is a long season’ and now I’m in my seventh year and I don’t want it to end. Your mentality definitely changes as you get older so I definitely appreciate it a lot more now</p>

  <p><b>[On Toronto FC]</b> They’ve got a good system, and play that system well. We’re probably going to go over more tactics once it gets a bit closer, but I think we’re going to be able to find spaces where we can exploit them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Seattle Sounders]</b> This is the deepest team I’ve been a part of and it’s not easy to manage every player when they’re not playing or thinking they should be playing. That’s good to have as a squad, but that’s hard to manage and I think he’s done a really good job of handling that.</p>
