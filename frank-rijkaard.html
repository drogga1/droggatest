  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> coach Frank Rijkaard visits the club with his son]</b> I’m very happy to see a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> game again in the stadium, most of all, for my son. He just turned 8, his dream was to watch a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game live. Just like almost all kids around the world, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is like a god to him</p>
