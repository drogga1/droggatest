  <p><b>[Ashlyn Harris speaks about how she and team-mate Ali Krieger first met]</b> We became really close friends, and we just hung out, we clicked, and we had so much in common. We always sat next to each other on the bus and on flights, and we kind of just talked about our dreams and our hopes and what we wanted to do one day when we grew up. Because at the time, we were kids. The rest has kind of been history. Here we are nine years later, and we’re going to be getting married this year</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris and defender Ali Krieger, who went public with their relationship in March and announced their engagement]</b> This is such a cool journey and we’re really taking it in to be able to say we’re doing this together.<br /><br />What people don’t realize is when she was left off roster after roster after roster, she still woke up at 8 a.m. with me to grind and to push herself. She had no light at the end of the tunnel, because nothing was guaranteed for her</p>

  <p><b>[USA goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris &amp; USA defender Ali Krieger speak with The Telegraph about their wedding and LGBTQ empowerment]</b> Creating change isn’t something that you just talk about, though, you have to really embody it. It’s not easy, it’s not something you go in and out of - you’ve got to be all in <b>[Harris]</b> - We can sleep when we’re dead.</p>

  <p><b>[USA goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris speaks about her tattoos]</b> I give myself really nice tattoos <b>[after big events]</b>. I feel like my life experiences are expressed through my artwork, and all of my artwork tells the story. When I came back from winning the World Cup, I got a portrait of a beautiful French model and the Eiffel Tower on my leg. I always try to create beautiful artwork on my body that reflects my experiences and things that are important, where I can tell a story</p>
