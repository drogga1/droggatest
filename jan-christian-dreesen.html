  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have announced a record turnover of €628.8 million over the 2015-16 fiscal year]</b> The 2015-16 fiscal year has been fantastic for Bayern, in terms of both sports and finances. Our members, staff and friends of the club can be very proud.<br /><br />Bayern are in outstanding shape, operating at the highest Champions League level in financial terms. We are in a superb position. That has been the case for the last few years, and that is more than ever true for 2016.<br /><br />Our entrepreneurial objective is the maximisation of sporting success alongside financial prudence. Our increasing financial power will be used primarily to make the regular investments required in our first-team squad in order to ensure we remain competitive among the elite teams in Europe</p>

The injuries to his fingers were severe and he may have lost some of them.</p>
