  <p><b>[Marouane Fellaini has slammed the short-term vision at Manchester United]</b> They brought in <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a>, they didn’t give him time. They brought in Van Gaal, they gave him two years and we started to do some things, he won the cup, but after that they sacked the manager because they want to win quickly. For me the club were too quick to sack Jose because a manager like that comes and he needs a lot of players to do his own philosophy. He wanted to build his team but after two years and a half they decided to sack him because the results were not there. That’s the problem, they have to find a solution together. A manager like Van Gaal, tactically is very strong and a lot of experience and they sacked him.<br /><br />They brought in one of the best managers in the world in <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, he wanted to build a team and they sacked him. It’s not easy to build a team in that time, you need more than two years. I don’t know what they will do with Ole. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, for the first season, he did amazingly, he improved the team, won things. Okay the second season, was a bit more difficult, but he tried and did his best to help the team<br /><br />Now you have a new manager, they wanted young players and that’s what happens when you play with just young players - they will be up and down, up and down, that’s football. Of course in football, you can’t play with just young players, you need a mix. I think to win games, to win titles, to win big games you need experience. Of course you can win with young players but not every game<br /><br /><b>[A man who faced criticism throughout his time with United, said of life in China]</b> It’s different, it’s a different atmosphere, the intensity is not the same, the crowd is not the same but it’s a new challenge. It was the time for me to leave Europe, I wanted a new challenge and I’m very happy with that so I don’t regret it at all. I played five-and-a-half years for Manchester. My first season was a transition, so I was in transition. I know I didn’t have a great season. But after that I played my games, played well and I won things. Okay, I didn’t win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but that’s part of football. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> was a strong team and was difficult to battle against them. But I did some great games, scored some important goals, so for me I was very happy with my time in Manchester</p>

  <p><b>[Marouane Fellaini rules out <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> reunion at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in January]</b> Jose is special for me.

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Ex-Man Utd midfielder Fellaini thanks medical staff after leaving hospital]</b> The time has come for me to thank from the bottom of my heart, the medical staff of the hospital, their nursing staff as well as my club and its medical staff for taking such good care of me with so much kindness and for ensuring my comfort whilst there<br /><br />The hardest part is behind me! Let’s keep fighting, it’s important</p>
