  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini claims to be unfairly portrayed as an aggressive player]</b> It think it’s easy for them to portray me as an aggressive player, but I’m not. I try to play my game, I try my best to recover the ball quickly: that’s my job. I try to be better all the time, to give my best for the team, for the club. I always want to improve<br /><br />We hope to do better than at the last World Cup and Euros. We have a great squad and we’re four years more experienced. We’re ready and want to do something special for the Belgian fans</p>

I want him to stay, the club wants him to stay. I think he will stay, it is nearly there</p>

I would like to say a special thank you to Jose for the faith he has always shown in me. My focus now is on the World Cup and I am looking forward to a successful season ahead.</p>

I think we wanted to show that we are together. I think it was a bad day against West Ham. We were all bad. Today I think we showed improvement and we have to keep going. <b>[Whose idea was it?]</b> Everybody. I think everybody is behind the manager. We have to do our best and do our job. We showed it today but we have to do better on Saturday..<br /><br />Yeah, but it was much better than West Ham. We put energy, effort, we run forward, we try to score the goal. OK we didn’t tonight, but we have to keep going. We have to continue to work hard. We have the next game Saturday and we play every three days so it is another chance to do better. We have to work hard and try to win on Saturday. It is always good to win the game before the break for internationals. Yes, it’s important. The spirit is there. You saw it today but we have to win on Saturday<br /><br />It’s always like that, strikers have to score to be confident. At the moment he doesn’t but I hope he will score on Saturday and show his confidence and score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s Marouane Fellaini says he believes that rivals Manchester City are not capable of finishing their league campaign unbeaten]</b> I don’t think so. I remember when I arrived in England it was a top four, now it is a top six, so every year it is more difficult. Next season we will see how it changes and in two and three years I think every year it is more difficult, the intensity is higher, so that’s why the Premier League is attractive. Manchester City are strong, but I think they will lose. Ok, they are very good and they have good players but it’s possible to beat them. We lost, but we have the second game at Old Trafford and we will see.<br /><br /><b>[On Manchester City]</b> They are very confident, all of them, they play good football, they play attacking football and they have a good dynamic</p>

I think we have a lot of games at Old Trafford coming up so it’s good to take points there and see after that. We’ll take it game by game to get the points we need<br /><br /><b>[Having netted twice against Roy Hodgson’s side at Old Trafford last season]</b> Good memories. We controlled the game and did well. We created lots of chances and won 4-0. The confidence was high. Okay, now it’s going to be completely different as every game is difficult and games are harder. I hope we win 4-0 but it will be tough</p>

They play good football. They play forward, they have a good dynamic so let’s see in the future.<br /><br />I don’t think that <b>[there is a big gap to make up]</b>. I remember when I arrived in England there was a top four, now it is a top six so every year is more difficult<br /><br /><b>[Just six of the ex-Everton man’s 13 appearances this season have come from the start, but Fellaini is happy to play any role]</b> It is not about my role. Sometimes the manager uses me defensively or offensively and when I can help the team I give my best. The manager gives me a lot of responsibility so I have to keep going. He has given me a lot of confidence, he trusts me and has given me an important role in the team. It is the manager who decides. If he needs me for 5-10 minutes, or 90 minutes. He is the man to know that. He knows better than anyone who is going to start or not</p>

I give everything for him, I feel comfortable and I am happy with him. It’s always good to be in the Champions League. It’s going to be a good atmosphere at the Mestalla, Valencia are a good team, so we go there with no pressure and play our game.<br /><br />It’s always good to score a goal but, for me, the most important thing is the three points. I think the supporters deserved that. I think that it was positive, I think the players were positive and aggressive. We wanted to win, we showed it and we gave everything to score a goal. We create a lot chances and I think we deserved the win today. OK, David did a great save and they had a few chances, but I think we did everything to win the game</p>

They come, they pay for their tickets and they want to see good football. But today the spirit was good, and we have to look forward with a lot of hunger. Criticism is part of football, but we have to work. We are a team, we are together and we give everything. Together we have to move forward and take the points. I think the team is confident now and we have to stay positive - play positive football, like we did today. We played positive football from the first minute and wanted to score. I think everyone can see that. We gave everything to score the goal and I think we have to continue that way. We had a lot of chances - we played forward. I think we have to keep this spirit and look forward. We play positive, score goals and show supporters how we want to make them happy.</p>

Now I wanted a new challenge and a new adventure<br /><br /><b>[The first of those is set to see them face PSG]</b> I think Manchester United are the favourites. With the confidence, they have at the moment, and how they play, I think they are favourites. But it’s a Champions League match, in the round of 16, so it’ll be 50-50. PSG have great players but they have two or three players injured. I think Manchester United have the advantage.</p>

  <p><b>[Marouane Fellaini insists his move from Manchester United to China was not driven by money]</b> I went to Shandong Luneng now because they were interested for years already. And I felt ready for a new challenge, a new culture, a new life. Okay, I’m only 31 years old. But I signed for three years. Afterwards I’m 34, then it would be too late to go to China. I could have joined a top European club and been important there for two more years, that would have been no problem. But after 10 years and 350 games in England, I felt ready for this step. I’m happy with my choice. I’m already a professional for more than 12 years and everything went fine. I made my own choices and don’t regret anything. I played at Standard <b>[Liege]</b>, the biggest club in Belgium and won titles there. I went as a record transfer to the Premier League and opened doors to England for other Belgian players. At Everton I did well and at United I won some cups and a Europa League. The only thing missing is a Premier League title, that’s true. But I don’t dream anymore about a comeback to European top football. But maybe a comeback to Belgium, why not?.<br /><br />Not me. I see this as a challenge at a club that has it all. Literally. You should see our medical and technical facilities. I love being here. With the Asian Champions League, I’ll have to play two games a week here as well. I won’t be able to get more rest than in England every week. But okay, it’s true that the intensity is different here<br /><br />My first season in Manchester was difficult, but I left as a respected player. I gave my very best for this club, played so many games and almost only scored important goals. I worked with super players and managers at one of the biggest clubs in the world. Then you can only look back with a smile. I really don’t have a favourite <b>[manager]</b>. David Moyes or Louis van Gaal. I learned something from every manager<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he would still be in Manchester had that call not been made]</b> I don’t know. In football there are opportunities that come and go. But I still had a contract at United, so maybe I would still be there</p>

I have many amazing memories with the Red Devils from my debut in 2007 to last year’s World Cup in Russia and I am very proud Belgium is No.1 in FIFA’s world rankings. I want to thank all those who have been part of my international career especially my team-mates, many of whom will be friends for life and all the coaches I have worked with.
