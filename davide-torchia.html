  <p>[<a href="daniele-rugani.html">Daniele Rugani</a>’s agent Davide Torchia has confirmed the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender is considering his options after falling further down the pecking order] I don’t know what <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have in mind, but they will certainly make their evaluations with many players, all of them at a high level. With the balance needed in the squad and also economically, it is possible <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> will try to sell someone. When you go to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, you are aware that there’s competition for places. He knows what <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> wants, having worked with him at Empoli, but on the other hand, a player like Daniele must have the desire to push for more. Obviously, the signals from the club have to be precise - there are five defenders now and if a player only has one game per year in the Coppa Italia, he has to consider his options. If they continue to believe in the player and the coach knows that too, then he’ll continue the growth process. I think that is the objective of the club, too<br /><br />[<a href="daniele-rugani.html">Rugani</a> rejected the chance to join <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last season and went on to sign a new four-year deal with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in March, but doubts remain over his future in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>] Last season the decision to say no to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was not just the club, but ours too. We were happy to stay and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> were happy to keep us. Now, he has a contract until June 2023 and the renewal certainly sent a signal. There are many talented players in his role now, we’ll see what happens. It’s only natural that there are other clubs interested in <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Rugani</a>.</p>
