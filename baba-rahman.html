  <p><b>[Baba Rahman has revealed that Eden Hazard is known around the club for predicting his performance in matches]</b> Sometimes before a game <b>[Hazard]</b> told me what he had planned for that game and he always made it later. He is really a clown. He always makes fun when we are in the dressing room or at dinner. He’s a funny guy who always makes people laugh around him. We don’t have to talk much about Eden’s qualities, he shows in every game that he is an amazing player<br /><br />As one of the best clubs in the world Chelsea gives many players the chance to fulfill their dreams and become a better football player with that system. Me for example I’m able to play at Schalke in front of 60,000 people regularly now, which helps me a lot in my development as a player.<br /><br />You can never say where football will guide you to. Maybe I stay for the next 10 years at Schalke but I also can imagine playing for Chelsea again. But at the moment I don’t think about these things, I’m really happy at Schalke</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea forward Eden Hazard is one of the best players in the world]</b> We have a lot of memories together. Before the games, in the locker room, I sat next to him every time. In general, we talked about life, about games. He is such a good player, so strong, and very dangerous too. I think he’s one of the best players in the world right now, and everyone sees it. Can he win the Ballon d’Or? With Eden everything is possible. I think it’s just a matter of time for him to win it</p>
