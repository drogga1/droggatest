It’s my brother’s dream though, to play for Arsenal. Given all Wilfried has given to Palace to help them remain a PL club, I hope Palace will be able to see their way to agreeing a deal with Arsenal that allows Wilfried to realise his dream of playing European football for the club he’s supported since childhood</p>

Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson expects Wilfried Zaha to return to the club after failing to seal a transfer away from Selhurst Park. Everton saw a £70 million plus players bid for the forward rejected, while Arsenal were also interested in his services before signing Nicolas Pepe.</p>

I see the social media, I see everything and it’s a thing where he needs time. He’s come from another league, he’s young. There’s this price tag that he has not put on himself, people have put that on him because of his performances, so you’ve got to give him time for him to reproduce that, it’s not going to come like that</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha has said that he cried when he was a young man struggling to get games in the youth setup in south London]</b> When I was playing at Under-18 level there was a coach who told me I wasn’t good enough. I used to go home and cry. My mum didn’t know what was going on. I was not getting games in the league. But then <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup came along and I got my chance. That was my breakthrough. You can’t let it get you down. I have had that in my career. I thought there was no way I was going to take that<br /><br /><b>[Zaha conceded that he was not in the right frame of mind earlier in the season]</b> What happened is the summer did affect me. When the season started it was still in my head. But after a while I told myself that I have got to get over it. Going around sulking is not going to help. I told myself I can’t be like that. The team has not disrespected me, or the club, or the fans. So they don’t deserve me disrespecting them<br /><br />We are definitely looking steady as a team right now. The team has got experience all over. A player like <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> coming in has really helped. He has this steadiness, he knows how to manage a game<br /><br /><b>[He’s also happy to give back to the area that raised him and has donated money to his old Sunday League team, the Lambeth Allstars as part of the Carling Made Local Fund]</b> The club has given so many people from the South London community a reason to come together and improve themselves both on and off the pitch</p>

We’ve got a good run going so I’m glad we can carry it on. Each goal is massive really because this is a big game. Over time there have been more important goals but I feel like every game, every goal I can get in a game is important so I’m glad I could get one today. I’m just glad we managed to get back in it, really. If you can’t win it, don’t lose. I’m glad we managed to get that point at least. We didn’t have the best first-half because we basically didn’t get anything but in the second-half, we pushed on, we pressed them and I feel that we deserved a point at least. We barely had the ball, so even having attacks, we were too tired to do anything. So props to them, they did their job to be honest in the first-half. We had to do something second-half</p>

I’ve watched a few games, what I thought of him is what I thought before. Everything that people are saying now - calling him ‘The Spider’ - we knew before, it is just that he is playing in front of the world now. We were saying it all before but it is nice to see the world know it now<br /><br /><b>[Wan-Bissaka is enjoying a memorable campaign in Manchester]</b> It is crazy. I remember every single one of my games like it was yesterday. 10 years is mad. It is emotional watching the videos back because those are some of the best moments of my career. I appreciate all the love from the club. All I remember is getting up from the bench and being so happy to be stood there coming on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Zaha leaves door open to Palace exit after ‘amazing’ <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> interest]</b> It was nice. Supporting them and having them wanting you at the same time, leaves you thinking: ‘this is amazing’. But things never worked out so you just have to move on as quick as possible. I was thinking this may happen. But my whole family was watching and it just didn’t work out<br /><br />I’m 27, trophies is what it’s all about. If there’s an opportunity to win trophies, then 100 per cent. That’s 100 per cent what I want in my career and what I’m working towards.<br /><br />I feel like I wasn’t given a really fair shot at the first team. I went through the age groups but then didn’t really get a chance. Then I spoke to <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> and he explained to me what it felt like to play for the Ivory Coast. For one thing, it’s <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> calling you and he’s explaining all these things to me. When they came to me I turned them down the first time because I wanted to play for England at the time.</p>

I had no idea he was leaving. He just told me straightforward stuff like obviously you know ‘you’re going to have to fight for your position you’re not going to play all the time, there’s a lot of youngsters in the team so you’ll be able to go in with the likes of <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Welbeck</a> and Cleverley’. I was like ‘that is more than fine all I want is my opportunity just to show what I can do’. It was a straightforward conversation.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he regrets how his spell at Old Trafford played out]</b> There’s never regrets Rio. I met so many amazing players that I watched from when I was young. You (Rio) were there, Giggsy was there, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> was there, Van Persie was there. So many players I’ve managed to learn from so it’s never regrets. I’m sitting in the same changing room as the players I’ve seen win titles after titles after titles that’s what I want in my career and it’s like I’m finally here with this lot. It’s different when you watch them first-hand.</p>

I would also like to thank West Midlands Police for their swift action in making an arrest. People need to understand that whatever your age, that your behaviour and your words come with consequences and you cannot hide behind social media. It is important social media platforms do as they did yesterday and seek out these individuals and remove them. This is not the first time I have received messages like this, nor am I the only player to receive messages like this - it happens every day. I want to thank everyone for the love and support but enough is enough! It is not enough to be disgusted by these messages I received and move on. It isn’t enough to just say #notoracism. We need action, we need education, things need to change</p>
