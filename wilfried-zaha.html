  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha admits a troubled spell at Manchester United left him fearing that he could slip and end up in League One]</b> There was a point I was thinking, ‘If I do not buck up, I could let this slip’. Before you know it, I could have been in League One.<br /><br />I knew that what happened at United should not define me as a person or player. It was about having a strong mentality and working hard. I’m at an age where I feel I have to start fulfilling my potential. People said I was not ready for my big move - but I didn’t get the opportunity and was just branded a flop. I had to start again. I’m doing it for myself and also to show I’m a good player.<br /><br />Players can come back stronger. Look at <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne. Jose Mourinho got rid of him at Chelsea, he joined Wolfsburg, came to City and is now one of the best players in the Prem. Sometimes, the easiest route is not the best route. You come back stronger. Look at Romelu Lukaku. He has scored the most goals in the league, even though some doubted him. He has proved everyone wrong<br /><br />I need to keep getting goals and assists. I will decide what to do next. For now, my performances are all that is on my mind. But I will learn from the past</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha is not scared of joining another big club]</b> I moved away when I was 19, 20. Whatever happened before happened and I have grown mentally. So that won’t scare me, if I get the opportunity to move away eventually, that will not scare me because of what happened in the past.<br /><br />There’s always going to be speculation. I am just trying to keep my head down, play my football. I am enjoying my football and I am contracted at Palace. I don’t really see myself anywhere <b>[else]</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha has been subject to severe scrutiny in recent weeks]</b> There’s loads of talk - loads of people saying I’ve got no end-product - and that just spurred me on to be a better player. During the times when I wasn’t playing at Man United, everyone was trying to come up with their own reasons why I’m not playing; I’ve got a bad attitude, this, that. So, I just get on with my football. I’ve used all that energy to help me go on the pitch and prove those people wrong. And prove to myself that I’m the player I want to be.<br /><br />To be honest I used to care a lot about <b>[the criticism]</b> but I don’t care so much <b>[now]</b>. Over the years, everyone’s painted a certain picture of me and everyone’s jumped on the bandwagon. I’ve just learned to not care anymore. People are going to say what they want to say. Sometimes, even when I play well the people who say the wrong things they choose not to say anything. If you’re not going to be fair, then why should I care about your opinion<br /><br />It was difficult when half of the team was injured but when you actually look at our team I feel like we’ve got a good enough team to be out of it. Now we’re out of that position where we were before<br /><br />I’m not really the type to be shouting orders and stuff like that that. I lead by what I do, by the way I exert myself on the pitch. I feel like it’s kind of infectious where you’ll see me giving 110 per cent then you’ll feel like you’ll have to give that back as well. I feel once we all do it, you see a massive difference with the way we play. You can see from how we’ve been playing recently. It’s been a long, hard season because everyone thought we were down and out. You would think that if you haven’t won seven games, haven’t scored any goals. But I’ve always had belief in the team. The only thing I always stressed to my team-mates was on paper we may have a good team, we may have good players, we may have this person, that person but until you deliver every game, that’s the only way that it matters. We could have whoever but unless you deliver on the matchday then it makes no difference. That’s why I just think we just need to perform every game to be where we want to be<br /><br />It’s unfortunate that we didn’t manage to get to the World Cup but we just need to be better next time we get the opportunity. I don’t regret the decision I made. Obviously I’ll be watching, cheering on England because I live here, I’ve been here most of my live but I don’t regret the decision at all<br /><br />Not one bit. I didn’t get picked for England for four years. Four years in football is a long time. So it gave me a lot of time to reflect on my decision and I thought me playing for Ivory Coast is the best thing for me<br /><br />Since I left when I was four I haven’t been back. That first time back, the reception I got at the airport was unreal. It was just nice to be back home and it was heart-warming to see the proper love I got from the people. They came to me twice or three times before and I turned them down. I was overwhelmed by the fact that even though I’ve turned them down they still believed in me and saw what I could add to the team. When they came back again I thought ‘this is a no brainer, they’re showing me how much they appreciate me and see what I can do for the team’. I just thought ‘I feel like I should definitely play for Ivory Coast now</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha has outlined how Crystal Palace can cause an upset by beating Manchester City]</b> It should be a good game. They will want to get revenge after we beat them. I am looking forward to it like I look forward to every game.<br /><br />You can’t let City play. We are going into the game with loads of energy and suffocating them and then we do our best to break on them. Against any top team you need to take your chances and I feel that against them last time we took our chances and it kind of surprised them. I feel that is the strategy going into games like that - you have to suffocate that and get around them and take opportunities when you get them<br /><br />When we are away we play a lot better. I feel people get a bit nervous in front of our own crowd, so the home form has not been the best. It shouldn’t be like that because our support is unreal. We need to do better at home because they are the games you should be pushing to win the most.</p>

For me to be better, to achieve what I know I am capable of, I have to aim to play at the very highest level, to win trophies.<br /><br />I’m blessed to have come this far in my playing career. But I feel like there is so much more I have to offer. I have to experience the Champions League. I just need the opportunity, that’s it. And I’ll do the rest</p>

When they came to me I turned them down the first time because I wanted to play for England at the time.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha has insisted he had no idea <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> was planning to leave <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after agreeing to join the club]</b> It crushed me a little bit because it was like, after speaking to him, it was a no-brainer that I wanted to go there. I had no idea he was leaving. He just told me straightforward stuff like obviously you know ‘you’re going to have to fight for your position you’re not going to play all the time, there’s a lot of youngsters in the team so you’ll be able to go in with the likes of <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Welbeck</a> and Cleverley’. I was like ‘that is more than fine all I want is my opportunity just to show what I can do’. It was a straightforward conversation.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he regrets how his spell at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> played out]</b> There’s never regrets Rio. I met so many amazing players that I watched from when I was young. You (Rio) were there, Giggsy was there, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> was there, Van Persie was there. So many players I’ve managed to learn from so it’s never regrets. I’m sitting in the same changing room as the players I’ve seen win titles after titles after titles that’s what I want in my career and it’s like I’m finally here with this lot. It’s different when you watch them first-hand.</p>

  <p><b>[Writing on social media, Wilfried Zaha thanked West Midlands Police for their swift response to the incident but says that everyone in society has to realise that actions have consequences]</b> Very disappointed we didn’t get a better result yesterday but I wanted to come on here to thank you all for all your messages of support. I would also like to thank West Midlands Police for their swift action in making an arrest. People need to understand that whatever your age, that your behaviour and your words come with consequences and you cannot hide behind social media. It is important social media platforms do as they did yesterday and seek out these individuals and remove them. This is not the first time I have received messages like this, nor am I the only player to receive messages like this - it happens every day. I want to thank everyone for the love and support but enough is enough! It is not enough to be disgusted by these messages I received and move on. It isn’t enough to just say #notoracism. We need action, we need education, things need to change</p>
