<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Messi netted 73 times in 2011-12, bagged 60 the following season and 54 last term]</b> Messi has surprised us ever since he emerged. With the career he has had, we never know where his ceiling is. He has changed with experience and with age. I wouldn’t necessarily go as far as to say that this is his best <b>[version]</b>, because there have been some amazing years. Every year he surprises you. But one of the things he has is his consistency in competition. He is consistently at a very, very high level<br /><br />When he started out, it was almost as a winger, on the right flank, taking advantage of his pace and his technique. And little by little, because of the needs of the team and his own conditions, he has moved to help the team and today, he is part midfielder, part attacker. He is farther from the goal. He still scores loads of goals. Not as many as before, but perhaps that is now his only function now. Messi is a player who can play in any position on the pitch<br /><br />Messi is important in any team. The skills he has mean that he is always extremely decisive. When you have Messi in your team, on the pitch, it is an important influence - and his presence also affects the rival. Apart from marking the rhythm of the games, he is a player who is defining an era.</p>
