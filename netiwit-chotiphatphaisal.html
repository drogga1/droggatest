  <p><b>[Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal read in a book that the practice of prostration had been abolished by King Chulalongkorn, who, the story goes, believed that forcing his subjects to kneel at his feet was cruel and humiliating. Puzzled that the tradition had survived despite a royal decree, Netiwit enlisted a friend to join him in a quiet act of protest. The pair raised their hands and stood up among the sea of students prone in the summer sun. Their peers looked around confusedly as they approached the statue, where they bowed their heads for a moment and then walked away. This simple act of defiance was shocking in a country where being just seen as irreverent toward the monarchy is a criminal offense]</b> I don’t want <b>[prostration]</b> to be banned, but people need to be informed about what it means<br /><br /><b>[After news reports and concerned friends alerted him to the General <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a>’s remarks that Netiwit’s brand of disobedience a disgrace to the institution of higher learning, Netiwit fired back to his 49,000 Facebook followers]</b> Who is a disgrace to the nation? … His Excellency the Prime Minister has been destroying the reputation of Thailand for the past three years<br /><br /><b>[Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal says that his generation may be the last to remember Thailand’s imperfect democracy]</b> I want to show people that they can actually do something, instead of just talking or thinking about it. Many students now, we know what it was like before the coup. We know the junta lies. We know that they create the fear<br /><br /><b>[Labeled as communists, student activists were slaughtered on the sports field, in hallways and in the elevators of Thammasat University, about a five-minute walk from the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The government says 46 students died on Oct. 6, 1976, though the toll is believed to have been far higher. No one has been held accountable for the atrocity, and talking about it is still taboo]</b> People are afraid that it could happen again, these things just keep repeating. It’s actually a kind of scar on the people of Thailand … My views are basically the opposite of the government. but slowly, more and more young people are starting to agree with me</p>
