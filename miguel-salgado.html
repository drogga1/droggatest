<blockquote>
  <p>[Vinicius Junior needs to leave Real Madrid on loan in order to develop his game] We have to think about what we should do with him now. There’s exaggerated pressure on the coach and the player. You have to stay calm and wait for your chance little by little. And maybe he should look for a strong team in Spain where he can play without so much pressure but with more minutes. Pressure isn’t good for young players. And he’s got a lot of it. Real Madrid is not just any team - it’s a team that’s under a different kind of pressure. The boy cost €45m when nobody knew him and is a player who has done well for the second team by showing something different from the others. He’s spectacular at dribbling and in terms of his speed. There’s no doubt he’s a great investment for the future.<br /><br />He reminds me of Marcelo when he first signed. He was a kid and nobody had high expectations about him. He arrived at the same time as Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain and was the least known. At the beginning, he suffered a lot, mainly defensively, but was very good in attack. We spoke with him and knew he’d adapt. He knew how to wait for his moment. But he didn’t have the pressure of Vinicius and didn’t suffer from him</p>
