  <p><b>[<a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a> 1-1 <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> We conceded the first goal and at that point I thought we had pressed the self-destruct button, but we showed great character to get back into the game. In the second half we started a bit slow and invited <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> onto us, but as the half wore on I thought we were the better team. Getting the balance right for us was important. At the start of the season we played well but weren’t solid enough. Then we became more solid but didn’t have enough quality going forward. I thought we got a better balance today</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United vs Preston]</b> Marcelo Bielsa’s highly regarded across the world and if you look at Leeds’ start he’s obviously had a big impact since he’s gone in. It’s like anything else when a coach goes in there’s a change in style and they do get a reaction. I’ll be interested to see how it pans out over the season, but I saw Leeds live against Stoke and thought they were excellent. He’s done a good job and it will be a tough test for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Preston held firm for 19 minutes, with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> having put five past <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> by the same stage at the weekend]</b> We didn’t disappoint. For the first 20 minutes we started brightly on the front foot. We went chasing the ball for the first goal. They are good-quality goals for them. The goals they scored were stuff we talked about. But when you play against that quality with their speed, it’s one thing to talk about stopping them. It’s another thing to do it. We can’t get too hard on ourselves. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were the better team. Their forward line is scary for any <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team. We need to take the positives of what we did well and take them onto Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff struck three times in the final 21 minutes to win their play-off battle with Preston 3-1 at a rain-lashed Deepdale]</b> I don’t think there was a lot in the game. I think the biggest frustration was that we found ourselves in good areas but didn’t make the most of the opportunities. We were wasteful. They tended to score from their opportunities. Ours were more off-target.<br /><br />Their second goal was really poor defending from our part. We should be tight, stop him playing, stop them playing that pass for Mendez-Laing to run through. Even then we should take a foul, bring him down and take a booking, stop the game. But we don’t.</p>

  <p><b>[A stunning <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> free-kick was enough to see Derby past play-off rivals Preston as they earned a 1-0 win at Deepdale on Wednesday evening]</b> I think, for our second-half efforts, we deserved something. Derby had a couple of good chances in the game but the one Brad Potts cut back for Alan Browne was good for us, too<br /><br />It’s damaging and I can’t get away from that. We’re all really disappointed with how the games have panned out. At this level, it’s fine margins and, at the moment, we’re finding ourselves on the wrong side of those margins</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> and Preston played out a goalless draw that did little to enhance their positions at either end of the table]</b> I don’t think there was a lot created in the game. I can’t remember a shot that they did anything with. We wanted to make sure we were hard to beat and we wanted a clean sheet<br /><br />We had those two chances at the end there, but unfortunately we didn’t get ourselves set enough to hit the target. I’m not over the moon with the performance. We wanted that clean sheet, but we need to find a better balance and do more in the final third if we are to challenge higher up</p>

  <p><b>[Preston rekindled their Championship play-off hopes with three late goals at Hillsborough to sink <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> 3-1]</b> It looked like it was going to be another frustrating night. First half we were fantastic, we could have been 4-0, 5-0 up, we had plenty of opportunities. On another night we could have been 4-0 up at half-time and in the second half we didn’t get up to tempo quick enough before their goal changed the game<br /><br />We probably got that bit of luck, albeit that was a free-kick on Declan for their second (disallowed) goal. But we got that one and that’s swung the game in our favour and then the second two finishes were fantastic to finish the game off</p>

  <p><b>[Jayden Stockley cancelled out a Lewis Grabban penalty as play-off chasers Preston and <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> fought out a tense 1-1 draw in the Sky Bet Championship]</b> I wouldn’t say we are pleased. They had one shot on target and that was the penalty. That shows how well we defended. Then it was about converting opportunities. It was a really silly penalty to give away. They get a lot of players behind the ball and are difficult to break down, so we made it hard for ourselves. But we got the goal back and pushed to get the next one. Unfortunately we couldn’t convert any of those opportunities. But we are still in the hunt. We have three big games left</p>
