Lille have invested a chunk of the €80 million they received for Nicolas Pepe by signing Turkey midfielder Yusuf Yazici from Trabzonspor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lille ace Yusuf Yazici has explained his decision to join the French outfit from Trabzonspor last summer]</b> <a href="luis-campos.html">Luis Campos</a> was very effective in my decision to sign for Lille. Our president’s and coach’s insistence on me was a big factor too. Lille have a reputation for discovering young talent and nurturing them onto the world stage. The Champions League was also a factor in my decision<br /><br />Among them, there are sports psychologists, communication managers, career management executives … I always dream and I work to achieve my dreams. Dreaming makes one feel alive. And it keeps me motivated<br /><br />For a football player, what you do off-field is as important as what you do on the field. For getting to know a country and its culture, you need to learn its language first. I’m taking French lessons in addition to my English lessons. I’m a person who can easily adapt to wherever I go. The only thing I have struggled with was the cold weather! Lille’s very cold! But I got used to it too. People in Lille are very friendly and nice. The people in the club are also the same. My team-mates helped me a great deal too. I thank them very much for that</p>
