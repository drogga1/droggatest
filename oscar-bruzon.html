<blockquote>
  <p>[Oscar Bruzon - Mumbai FC is a traditional club of India and we’re going to fight for it] Since I arrived in the city, I have been feeling the support from the managers of the club and also the fans. I can say that the Yellow Brigade was very close to me, sharing good words and I believe they are also excited to see the new Mumbai [team]. And having all the remaining games at Cooperage has a lot of importance, indeed.<br /><br />This is why, this week, we are planning to undergo as many sessions and friendly matches as possible, at Cooperage, to get used to it. We shall try several modifications and see how it works until 8th April- this is our final of the World Cup!<br /><br />I’m Spanish, I come from a generation where football is all about having control of the game. You can state it as possession football. But for now, the only football I like is the kind of football which will make us win three points!<br /><br />The mood in the camp is fantastic. We are trying to fix things slowly. We need to get back the confidence of players. We are playing a lot of videos of ourselves, our rivals, some La Liga teams and some tactical principles that can be implemented in the team. We are putting a lot of efforts and the players are understanding it well and responding to it, too<br /><br />We are dealing with some injuries. Alex Willian Silva is training apart from the team. But I am hoping by next week, he should be joining the group. He is facing a calf injury<br /><br />We are conceding a lot of goals, so I think we need to find a balance between scoring goals and not conceding. If we are conceding two, three goals a game, then it will be impossible to win. So, the first thing we need to do is focus on the consistency in our defense. Once that is done, we shall start building our attack</p>
