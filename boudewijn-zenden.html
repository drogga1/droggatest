<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Boudewijn Zenden fears that Liverpool will struggle to contain Barcelona sensation Lionel Messi]</b> It is impossible to stop him by using a single player. It makes no sense speaking about that, especially because he plays in a lot of different positions in every game. We saw it once more against Levante. It makes no sense speaking about how to stop him because you can’t stop him<br /><br /><b>[Zenden said of Van Dijk]</b> He already played versus Barcelona with Celtic. Playing against Messi needs teamwork but the main problem with that is Barcelona always have advanced passing lines and it makes the situation even harder to defend. That’s why Barcelona always score, it is not only because they are so good, it is because their style is almost impossible to defend. But Liverpool is another offensive team with their own style. I think it is impossible there is a 0-0 <b>[draw]</b> in any game<br /><br /><b>[Zenden spent two seasons at Liverpool between 2005 and 2007]</b> I only have good memories of this club, they have a great history full of success and there is a lot of suffering as well. They have united all the fans and you can feel it in the Champions League nights especially. You have to live it, you have to feel it to be able to understand it</p>
