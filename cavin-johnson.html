  <p><b>[Former AmaZulu coach Cavin Johnson has revealed he is not currently engaged in talks with Cape Town City, and is taking it easy and catching up on the latest coaching trends]</b> No, nothing as yet. I’m just taking it easy and catching up on other football matters that are happening around the world of coaching</p>

  <p><b>[Black Leopards coach Cavin Johnson feels his side were unfortunate to share the spoils with Kaizer Chiefs]</b> It was not what we expected because I thought Kaizer Chiefs were very strong on their set pieces throughout the season and we dealt with that very good as a team that is struggling. That’s all they did for us, throw the ball in the front, try and get a set piece, organise their big guys to sort of head the ball in the net but yeah they got it right in the first half because one of our players didn’t do the right thing. Yeah it’s a turn the corner for Black Leopards but at the same time maybe we could have stolen the game, I don’t know because I thought we played a lot better and we could have stole it in the last 20 minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Black Leopards coach Cavin Johnson is against the view of continuing the 2019/20 Premier Soccer League campaign]</b> If we say we want to follow Fifa protocols then that means we have to do the right thing, give the trophy to Chiefs. I know there are some people that will argue that they still have to play games and that Chiefs were still to play so and so but they must be given the trophy, honestly. I don’t think it’s a good idea to finish the season because it is too dangerous to do so. Let’s just hope when the PSL committee meets during the week, they will put the lives of the people ahead of everything.<br /><br />We must know that if the PSL committee decides not to continue with the games that will be all about saving the lives of thousands of people. Even if they choose to continue with the games, there’s a lot that needs to be considered just like they might need at least four weeks for the games to continue, to ensure everything is in place. Right now, we are on Level-4, when will we reach Level-3 or Level-2? This coronavirus pandemic is scary because we don’t know when it will end. There’s a lot of travelling involved when PSL games are played. In this scenario, travelling is not a good idea.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Black Leopards coach Cavin Johnson has showered AmaZulu striker Bonginkosi Ntuli with praise, saying he wanted to sign the burly hitman before he went to Mamelodi Sundowns]</b> I remember that I wanted to sign him from Lamontville Golden Arrows when I was still at Platinum Stars. Unfortunately, he joined Mamelodi Sundowns but things didn’t go well for him. I talked to Pitso Mosimane and he allowed me to have him on loan at Stars. He shined and scored goals for us because I believed in him. That is why when we reunited at AmaZulu, I made sure that we sign him permanently by selling Emiliano Tade. He’s a top striker and he is matured. He’s a friendly person and likes to do the job. He’s no longer a child, he’s growing up. I like the fact that he has scored a number of goals this season because he’s at a stage where he has to shine because he will get old in the next few years. I think what’s important is that he’s well taken care of at AmaZulu. He’s happy and because he’s at home in Durban because he always wanted to work closer from home. All I know about him is that he plays well when he’s happy, taken care of and when the team shows faith in him. If he ends up leaving AmaZulu, let’s just hope he will join a team that is similar to AmaZulu</p>
