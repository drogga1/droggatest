  <p><b>[Le Havre chief recruiter Franck Sale believes the Frenchman will definitely seek a new challenge but that all might not be well if he joined Real Madrid]</b> If <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> has a coach with a strong personality around him, in time there will be a clash somewhere. When he left for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> a few years ago, with <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> that was very complicated too. Paul didn’t concede because he has such a strong character. So when he says, ‘I’m leaving’, he’s leaving. If tomorrow he goes to a big club like a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he’ll still have his conflicts, even with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> <b>[Zidane]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[And he believes the Frenchman has become too comfortable at Old Trafford and that he’s ready for a new challenge away from the club]</b> Paul is a man who needs to be challenged. I think he is becoming too comfortable at United. It’s not as demanding for him as it was a few years ago. I think he is ready for a new challenge, that’s obvious. I can see him leaving for another big club searching for this new challenge<br /><br />It was him who led everyone, so I’m not surprised by his strong personality today. You could see that he was already technically skillful. He possessed a strength of character and had a self-assurance that some would call arrogance. He was someone that was sure of his fate, sure of his qualities</p>
