  <p>The racist chanting by Spanish fans at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s Bernabeu stadium friendly international in Madrid has embarrassed the government amid fears it could damage the city’s bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games. A couple of thousand Spanish fans hurled racist abuse at England’s black players every time they came near the ball<br /><br />It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that the Spanish government released a press statement condemning the football fans’ racist chants. This was several hours after Britain’s Sports Minister, Richard Caborn, had demanded some sort of response<br /><br />As the centre-left newspaper El Pais noted, the racist chanting came as much from groups of well-heeled young Spanish men in the crowd as from the well-known football thugs labelled the ‘Ultras’<br /><br />On the whole though, repugnance for the appalling show of racism was notably lacking in Spain’s newspapers. The incident was reported but rather played down. Easily as much column space was devoted to criticism of English forward <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>’s behaviour on the pitch as to the Spanish fans’ bad behaviour off it.<br /><br />Alejandro, a plumber, said the event was being blown out of proportion. ‘The kids’ chanting last night was stupid but harmless. Football is always about insulting the other team. The racism wasn’t meant seriously.’<br /><br />His workmate Miguel agreed: ‘We Spaniards aren’t more racist than any other country. Italy has problems with football and racism, doesn’t it? It’s much worse than here. I mean look at our star players <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> (Real Madrid), <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> (Real Madrid) and <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> (FC Barcelona) - they’re not white and we worship them’<br /><br />Alicia, a production manager, said she thought the Spanish fans’ behaviour was much worse than usual because they felt the English press was looking for racism here. ‘All the English players arrived here in Spain wearing anti-racism T-shirts, as if this were the most racist country on earth. I know this was in response to <b>[Spanish coach]</b> Luis Aragones’ remarks a while back. But it was wrong of the English players and the English press to assume we are all like that. So I think the fans felt provoked. They thought: If they want to see us as racists, then we’ll behave as racists. It’s stupid but I think that’s what happened’<br /><br />But Julia, a secretary in her 20s, said she was appalled. ‘I’m so upset at what happened. We all know a black player is the same as a white player. There’s no difference at all’<br /><br />Economics student Carlos said: ‘I was at the match last night and got really angry about what was happening. I hate the fact that this is the face of Madrid, of Spain, that was being broadcast the world over. ‘Most of us aren’t so narrow-minded. People forget there were 80,000 fans at the stadium. Only a small minority behaved so disgustingly’</p>
