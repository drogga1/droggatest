<blockquote>
  <p>[Roma academy director Massimo Tarantino does not believe there is any secret to the club’s history of youth development success] We have no magic formula, just common sense to be inclusive and respectful of our footballing identity. We aim play purposeful football. The main goal is the goal, but for this we have to fight the Italian mentality to [first and foremost] avoid conceding goals.<br /><br />We look at Spain and Holland, but we can not forget our Italian heritage. We seek to allow the player to become an active part of the game, not a passive part<br /><br />At this point no one is inventing anything [new]. It is rather to be clear what we want see on the field in order to replicate it in training. Rondos affect much in the game of possession and empty spaces, but we do not forget the analytical aspects of the defensive phase. It is a constant balance and work based on the assimilation process that makes each player<br /><br />In this regard we are somewhat similar to Athletic Club of Bilbao, which focuses on Basque players. But if we look a lot at kids from Rome, it is not an identity but functional question, because Rome is a huge city and gives us a great opportunity being close to many young talented players<br /><br />They know we offer them the chance of playing in our first team or in another teams and having good contracts. They simply are less interested in the face of Premier League clubs’ interest</p>
