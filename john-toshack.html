  <p><b>[Real Madrid outcast Gareth Bale was panned this week by former Real boss John Toshack for not using Spanish in interviews, with the 70-year-old calling his countryman’s behaviour an insult to to his teammates]</b> It saddens and sickens me. Come out Gareth, do an interview, speak yourself. You’ve been there for six or seven years now, you don’t speak the language. That’s an insult to the people you are working for</p>

  <p><b>[John Toshack has hit out at <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, suggesting he does not play for the team]</b> I remember one day, against Croatia or Greece, we had a free-kick on the right-wing and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> runs up at the right side of the ball and ‘pam’, with the outside of his boot. I said to him: ‘Hey Gareth, take care with this <b>[technique]</b>. Ligaments, cartilages, take care’. We had another free-kick and he did exactly the same, but it resulted in a goal and I said: ‘See, do what you want!’. But I’ve seen <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> injured, and many times I think these <b>[injuries]</b> are related to this<br /><br /><b>[He has picked up four Champions League winners’ medals during his time in Spain, but only one <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> title.

With him it is sometimes like playing with 10 players. He is very individualistic</p>

  <p><b>[It was during his second spell with <a href="real-madrid.html">Los Blancos</a> in 1999, he came out with an infamous quote which prompted his immediate dismissal. Under pressure from the board for his team selections, Tosh blurted out, in Spanish]</b> John Toshack certainly left his mark on Spanish football during his stints as coach at <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>, Deportivo, Real Murcia and especially at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It was during his second spell with <a href="real-madrid.html">Los Blancos</a> in 1999, he came out with an infamous quote which prompted his immediate dismissal. Under pressure from the board for his team selections, Tosh blurted out, in Spanish<br /><br /><b>[Toshack chatted about the difficulties he faced while in the Madrid job and looked right back to his childhood, joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a player as well as his thoughts on <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, who he has been vocal about in recent months]</b> The first thing I want to say is to ask if you can name a coach who has won Copa, la Liga and the Super cup with three different clubs - ok, <a href="fabio-capello.html">Capello</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>… But I won the Super cup Depor beating Madrid in both legs - home and away, the Liga with the record for the most goals and <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>’s only Copa del Rey in 1987. I learned a phrase which they say a lot in Spain: Flor de un día - the equivalent in English is ‘Flash in the pan’ so I’m proud to be able to say that’s something you can’t say about me. I’m not a flor de un día<br /><br /><b>[Soon after, in November 1970, Toshack finally accepted a move to <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a>’s Liverpool]</b> I still didn’t have my driving licence, I passed the test in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. So I travelled up there by train and I remember getting off the carriage at Lime Street station and there on the platform waiting was <a href="bill-shankly.html">Shankly</a> wearing his famous trilby and looking like an American gangster. I walked towards him and he said: ‘Welcome to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, son. You’ve left Sunday school and you’ve come to church…‘<br /><br /><b>[Toshack decided a clear-out was needed with the old guard (Mijatovic, <a href="davor-suker.html">Suker</a>, <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, Raúl and Guti) on his black list. Madrid broke the Spanish transfer record to bring in French striker <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a> for 33 million euros (5.600 million pesetas) in a summer which also saw the arrivals of <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">Steve McManaman</a>, Elvir Baljic and Geremi Njitap]</b> Let’s see, I’ve got to be careful about what I say because all of this happened a long time ago. I remember <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was manager at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I had a conversation with him because <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> wanted to leave, but something strange happened. When I saw what Madrid had paid for <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>, it wasn’t the figure that I had understood initially. I was astounded… The fee I’d agreed was far lower than that amount. Something strange went on there…<br /><br /><b>[Toshack changed the system as soon as he arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, playing with three at the back. Then president Ramón Mendoza was less than impressed. Toshack recalls his reaction]</b> ‘John, this… is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, not Real Sociedad’. So I told him, don’t talk to me about <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> who had won 4-1 here. And (Fernández) Trigo (one of the top members of the board) who was like a sergeant major barked: ‘Hey Welsh, come here’. Trigo, who was coaching the Under-17s or something like that, asked me why I was playing this player and not that player… And so I said: ‘Don’t give me that cr*p..’. I fielded exactly the same team in the next game and we put six past <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>. Then after that… 5-0, 4-0, 6-0 finishing the league on 107 goals. (…) I remember when the league was over Mendoza turned to me in the celebratory dinner and said: ‘Not bad for a defensive team, 107 goals’…<br /><br /><b>[Fast forward to the current Madrid side and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, Toshack is adamant that his fellow countryman has everything he needs to succeed in Spain and only needs to take more care of himself to avoid getting injured and learn a bit of the lingo]</b> First of all he has extraordinary talent. He made his international debut with me when he was still 17 - which I’m sure you’ve seen. In any national team, if you get to make your senior debut when you are 17, it’s for something. He was playing at Southampton then, as a left-back and that was one of the reasons I picked him. He came in handy for us at that time and he just exploded from the first moment - Ramsey started at the same time. I remember <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> fouling players (..) He didn’t take part in the game as much - maybe he’d get involved for five minutes and that was all. He’d occasionally make a run then drop back. He’s a very individual player<br /><br /><b>[Toshack’s theory on <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s injury problems]</b> I remember one game against Croatia or Greece. We won a free-kick out on the right and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> got the ball, sprinted up the wing and boom - he shot with the outside of his boot. So I called him over and said: ‘Hey Gareth… be careful doing that eh? Ligaments, cartilage… be careful’. We get another foul and Gareth does exactly the same, gets the ball and scores. So I said, ‘Look, do what you like’. But, if you look at the injuries that <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> has had, and I think he’s had too many, I’ve often thought that explosive style he has could have something to do with it<br /><br /><b>[As for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s apparent inability or reluctance to express himself openly in Spanish, Tosh says he has no excuses]</b> I never had Spanish lessons. People said that I spoke poor Spanish, that I couldn’t speak the language properly but little by little, after trying to speak, to read, making an effort… I’d still get all the verbs wrong and get mixed up… But for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, to be in a country like the one he’s in, in my view he has to speak the language. Sometimes, I’d just like to know what he’s thinking. And that’s not me being overcritical with him. Even if you get things wrong or make mistakes, you can still express yourself in another way. It’s like a challenge or a little battle</p>

  <p><b>[John Toshack says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>’s performances when fit for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are impossible to criticise]</b> All I see is that <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> has suffered with injuries. In Madrid they always look at you with a magnifying glass, they always criticise someone and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, for one reason or another, has not done many interviews but his performance is impossible to criticise. You have to take into account his bad fortune with injuries, but you see his numbers in Madrid in terms of goals per game and titles and they are unbeatable<br /><br />It is very difficult to criticise <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I am not an expert at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but I do feel that criticising <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> seems like a mistake. With what he has done, he has already proved so much<br /><br /><b>[Toshack added on the Blancos’ chances of completing a clean sweep]</b> You only have to see the few teams that have won all three titles in one season, it is very difficult. But if there is a team that can do it then it is <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in Germany or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in Spain. There is a lot of accumulation in matches and it is a huge test for any team, which is why almost no team has done it</p>
