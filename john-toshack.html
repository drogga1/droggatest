  <p><b>[Gareth Bale’s injury struggles are making things even harder for him at Real Madrid]</b> His injuries are probably hindering him now. He has missed so many matches and despite Madrid winning so many matches and trophies, it must be hugely frustrating. Should he move to another club? Only people at Madrid will know about this but the demands at the Bernabeu are very, very high. If you are less than 100 per cent physically fit, it becomes even harder.<br /><br />He is now 28 and 11 years after making his debut with me at 17, these should be the best years of his life. The entire BBC <b>[Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> now has problems and for various reasons, such as others now coming through, I’m unsure we’ll see much more of them together from now on.</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs is the new man in charge of Wales]</b> The first thing Ryan will have to do is to turn up for the games! Because when he was a player, he never turned up for half the matches. Any time we had a friendly match, Fergie pulled him out! He never came! So the first thing he’s got to do is turn up, just to be there for friendly games. And then we’ll have to see then what develops. I’m not quite sure what kind of coaches he’ll have in there with him. I think there’s a solid base there for him to start with now but within 12-18 months, they’re going to have to start to turn things around again and that’s always a difficult transitional period. But obviously, we wish him the very best. He played at the very highest level, won everything there is to win in the game. We’re not going to learn anything about Ryan Giggs the player now, but management is a different thing, we’ll have to wait and see.<br /><br />I know this Welsh side very well. I managed Wales for six years at a very difficult time, when the old players were finishing. We had to push a lot of these young players through. If you’re a manager of a national side, you can’t buy players. You can’t sell them, either. I would have sold a few, if I could! You’re stuck with what you’ve got. And we were in a position where we had to push these young players through. <b>[Wayne]</b> Hennessey, the goalkeeper, 19. Ashley Williams, the centre back, 22. Gareth Bale was 17, Aaron Ramsey, 18. Strikers Simon Church, Ched Evans. All young players. So we had to play a little bit of damage limitation to a system: You can’t be going out and getting beat two or three every week. They were six frustrating years, we had Gareth Bale with a bad injury and Aaron Ramsey with a broken leg. And it was very difficult.<br /><br />I’ve been gone seven years and the side that reached the semi-final at the European Championships, of the starting line-up, nine of those players have made their debut with us as youngsters. And we’ve been gone six, seven years. So that tells you the manager at that particular time, Chris Coleman, who I know very well, I was responsible for him getting the job at Real Sociedad, had a far easier job than what we had seven years earlier. This was a group of players, they were boys when we had them and they’re young men now. They picked up experience. I remember when I used to go and watch, I hardly watched a Premiership match. Apart from Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy, I did not have players in the Premiership. Now all this team have grown and grown and grown and they are all Premiership players now. So, it was a disappointment for Wales and the Wales public that they missed out on the World Cup. I was at that game where they missed out against the Republic of Ireland. It was a big, big disappointment because that Welsh side should have qualified for this coming World Cup. But now, over the next 12-18 months, there is another rebuilding job that is going to be have to be done. They’ve named Ryan Giggs as manager over a four-year period. It’s going to be interesting to see what happens. Ryan has no experience of management at any level. It’ll be interesting to see what happens because this group have probably another year or 18 months in them and there’s a rebuilding job to be done with Wales</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp needs to a deliver a trophy at Liverpool or he could find his position under threat]</b> I think at Liverpool it’s about winning trophies. He <b>[Klopp]</b> seems a bright, happy-go-lucky type who obviously was successful at the last club he was in, in Germany but I’m not sure that … I think this year, or by the end of next season, you need to see some kind of trophies there. If not, particularly, the way football is these days, I think they’ll be looking to change again. I think this is a big season for Klopp. When the time comes, middle of May, end of May, will be time to sit back and look.<br /><br />Defensively, the Liverpool I knew, or the Liverpool we became to know over the years, win championships conceding 15 or 16 goals. Liverpool concede far too many goals. However bright and attacking your football is, if you need to score three or four to win a game every week, it’s going to become very, very difficult. They’ve shipped in too many goals recently and I guess even a fourth place finish this year would be, I think, as much as Liverpool can hope for<br /><br />I listened to Klopp and I think Klopp was right when he says, it’s very difficult once you’re with players, they get it into their heads, they want to move and they got an opportunity to move. There are now agents, representing players all over the places, it is very difficult. We’ve seen that with Arsenal recently, Alexis Sanchez and with maybe <b>[Mesut]</b> Ozil as well. In our day, we didn’t feel we could benefit by moving from Liverpool. We couldn’t see anywhere where we could go, where we would be better off than Liverpool. But now of course, the big European clubs with the money, it’s very difficult for the second-tier teams to keep their best players. Tottenham have been doing very well recently but they will have a problem keeping these couple of top players - Harry Kane and Dele Alli.<br /><br />Once these players feel there’s a big chance of going to one of the big ones abroad, maybe Paris Saint-Germain, or Real Madrid or Barcelona, it becomes very difficult. As I mentioned earlier, I think Klopp spoke very well: ‘Look, we tried to keep Coutinho, but you can’t strangle him and say you’ve got to stay and you have to play here’ and I think he has handled it well. Coutinho has played decent matches for Liverpool up until this particular time and then he’s left. He shook hands and said ‘Good luck, off you go’ and that’s it. There’s so much power now in the players that it becomes very difficult to keep an unhappy player. It spreads dissent in the dressing room, a very complicated business now. Much more difficult than it was</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has faced criticism from former Real Madrid manager John Toshack for failing to learn Spanish during a five-year spell at the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> He is a different player from his team-mates. He doesn’t like to speak to the press, and it’s very sad that with all the time he has been in Spain, he doesn’t know how to speak the language. If you are going to play in another country, at least you have the obligation to try. People will always think better of you if you make the effort.<br /><br />If you put yourself in Zidane’s situation you have to understand it. If you analyse the injuries you see that they are not normal. Bale would undoubtedly be a starter if he did not have those injury problems</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has been warned that people remember the trophies]</b> At the end of the day, particularly at the top clubs like Liverpool, you’re going to be judged by the trophies that you win. You might think it’s not fair, you have a terrific season and just miss out, finish runners up in a really good championship campaign, be beaten in the semi-finals of a cup or whatever. At the end of the day, the years go by, people remember the trophies. To be three years and four seasons at Liverpool and be trophyless, from a distance you say, ‘That is not successful. It can’t be’. At the same time, those of us in the game know there’s only one who can win it, three trophies or whatever. Maybe this is a big year for Liverpool. I think Man City are just that little bit ahead of everybody else. I think if Liverpool can do it this year, it’d be great for the club and for everybody and Klopp. It would take the pressure off. I’m pretty sure once they win one, they’ll go on and get a couple more. It’s just getting that first one that is the most difficult and the most important.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey has been urged to avoid making the same mistakes Gareth Bale did when joining Real Madrid]</b> He has a unique opportunity to play with Cristiano Ronaldo, to grow, to improve, and that’s a lucky break for a lad who hasn’t had much luck. I remember watching TV when he really hurt himself playing against Stoke in 2010. I was stunned. It took him nine months to get back, but the experience helped forge his character. He grew up over time, but now he’s 28 years old and ready to explode.<br /><br />Juventus are doing really well when it comes to free agents and contracts running down, picking up top players for free like Emre Can and Sami Khedira. They’ve already got a great talent like Miralem Pjanic and World Cup winner Blaise Matuidi, so it’s an excellent midfield<br /><br />I would recommend to everyone, football players or not, to go abroad. I’ve made it a point of my management career to go out and get to know new cultures. I can assure you that for British players, it’s not easy to move abroad. It’s crucial that Aaron doesn’t make the same mistake that Bale did at Madrid. He needs to learn the local language straight away. That might also be why it’s best he join Juve in the summer and not in January<br /><br />He was always a talent, but I don’t know if I’d call him a star yet. For the moment he is playing for a big club and very soon he’ll be at a huge club. That says a lot about his quality, even if I haven’t quite figured out what his best position is yet. That is an issue Juve will need to clarify straight away. I don’t know if Aaron is disciplined enough to play in front of the defence. I am also not sure he scores enough to play close to the strikers.<br /><br />He might do better in a three-man midfield, where he has the possibility to push forward, or perhaps in a three supporting the centre-forward. In modern football you do need to be versatile and he is a modern player</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has been urged to copy what Cristiano Ronaldo does]</b> Cristiano plays as a winger, scores and sets up goals for the others. There’s no doubt that Gareth is one of the best players of all time. If he wants to continue there, he should try and copy what Cristiano does. If you look at what he’s achieved, it makes you wonder what he would have done if he hadn’t been so unlucky with injuries.<br /><br />So, obviously, with the experience he has, maybe he can drop off a little and play short balls, drop deeper and read the game more. I hope that he goes on to do more than he’s done so far, because when you come back from an injury, you know that you have to start all over again. As for getting back to full fitness, he’s got to do that all over again and it’s something he’s had to do two or three times every season which sets him back.<br /><br />It’s been very difficult for him and, as I say, he deserves credit for the way he’s persevered. What we could never have really imagined were the injury problems he’s had. I mean he’s lost almost as many games as he’s played and clearly that’s hampered his progress a little bit</p>

It needs sorting out as soon as possible… because when you look at this player, what he’s shown that he can do and look at what he’s producing at the moment, something is going terribly, terribly wrong somewhere.<br /><br />I would have thought he would have been absolutely banging the dressing-room door down to get out there on the pitch at this particular moment in time, to show people that they’re making a mistake by not playing him. People talk about maybe the fitness levels are not there, but I don’t go along with that 100%. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s performances recently have been disappointing, no question about that. And I think the sooner that things get sorted out for him now the better it’ll be for Wales and for himself because, from what I can see over here, there’s not the brightest future for him at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. There’s a bit of a battle going on here between his agent and Madrid at the moment, I think, that needs to be sorted out</p>

I learned a phrase which they say a lot in Spain: Flor de un día - the equivalent in English is ‘Flash in the pan’ so I’m proud to be able to say that’s something you can’t say about me. I’m not a flor de un día<br /><br /><b>[Soon after, in November 1970, Toshack finally accepted a move to <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a>’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I still didn’t have my driving licence, I passed the test in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

I walked towards him and he said: ‘Welcome to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, son. You’ve left Sunday school and you’ve come to church…‘<br /><br /><b>[Toshack decided a clear-out was needed with the old guard (Mijatovic, <a href="davor-suker.html">Suker</a>, <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, Raúl and Guti) on his black list. Madrid broke the Spanish transfer record to bring in French striker <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a> for 33 million euros (5.600 million pesetas) in a summer which also saw the arrivals of <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">Steve McManaman</a>, Elvir Baljic and Geremi Njitap]</b> Let’s see, I’ve got to be careful about what I say because all of this happened a long time ago. I remember <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was manager at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I had a conversation with him because <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> wanted to leave, but something strange happened. When I saw what Madrid had paid for <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>, it wasn’t the figure that I had understood initially. I was astounded… The fee I’d agreed was far lower than that amount. Something strange went on there…<br /><br /><b>[Toshack changed the system as soon as he arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, playing with three at the back. Then president Ramón Mendoza was less than impressed. Toshack recalls his reaction]</b> ‘John, this… is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, not Real Sociedad’. So I told him, don’t talk to me about <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> who had won 4-1 here. And (Fernández) Trigo (one of the top members of the board) who was like a sergeant major barked: ‘Hey Welsh, come here’. Trigo, who was coaching the Under-17s or something like that, asked me why I was playing this player and not that player… And so I said: ‘Don’t give me that crap..’. I fielded exactly the same team in the next game and we put six past <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>. Then after that… 5-0, 4-0, 6-0 finishing the league on 107 goals. (…) I remember when the league was over Mendoza turned to me in the celebratory dinner and said: ‘Not bad for a defensive team, 107 goals’…<br /><br /><b>[Fast forward to the current Madrid side and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, Toshack is adamant that his fellow countryman has everything he needs to succeed in Spain and only needs to take more care of himself to avoid getting injured and learn a bit of the lingo]</b> First of all he has extraordinary talent. He made his international debut with me when he was still 17 - which I’m sure you’ve seen. In any national team, if you get to make your senior debut when you are 17, it’s for something. He was playing at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> then, as a left-back and that was one of the reasons I picked him. He came in handy for us at that time and he just exploded from the first moment - Ramsey started at the same time. I remember <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> fouling players (..) He didn’t take part in the game as much - maybe he’d get involved for five minutes and that was all. He’d occasionally make a run then drop back. He’s a very individual player<br /><br /><b>[Toshack’s theory on <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s injury problems]</b> I remember one game against Croatia or Greece. We won a free-kick out on the right and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> got the ball, sprinted up the wing and boom - he shot with the outside of his boot. So I called him over and said: ‘Hey Gareth… be careful doing that eh? Ligaments, cartilage… be careful’. We get another foul and Gareth does exactly the same, gets the ball and scores. So I said, ‘Look, do what you like’. But, if you look at the injuries that <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> has had, and I think he’s had too many, I’ve often thought that explosive style he has could have something to do with it<br /><br /><b>[As for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s apparent inability or reluctance to express himself openly in Spanish, Tosh says he has no excuses]</b> I never had Spanish lessons. People said that I spoke poor Spanish, that I couldn’t speak the language properly but little by little, after trying to speak, to read, making an effort… I’d still get all the verbs wrong and get mixed up… But for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, to be in a country like the one he’s in, in my view he has to speak the language. Sometimes, I’d just like to know what he’s thinking. And that’s not me being overcritical with him. Even if you get things wrong or make mistakes, you can still express yourself in another way. It’s like a challenge or a little battle</p>
