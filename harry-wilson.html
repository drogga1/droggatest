  <p><b>[Peter Edwards, a 62-year-old electrical contractor, after winning £125,000, on a £50 bet placed at odds of 2,500-1 in 2000, that his grandson Harry Wilson, then three, would play at senior international level for Wales]</b> My wife is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn’t be coming back. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet. He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk - that’s what gave me the idea</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> I spoke with the gaffer and we all know what a fantastic number eight he was. He’s not a bad person to learn from!<br /><br /><b>[The Welsh youngster also praised the influence that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has had on his development in his breakthrough season in English football with the Rams]</b> He gave me a few tips on how to play there and just told me to get on the ball as much as I can - and when we haven’t got the ball, try to get out and press. I tried to do that and if he needs me to play there again, I can do that</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Wilson would be willing to consider a move from Liverpool to Derby County if promotion to the Premier League can be secured]</b> I’ve seen a lot of reports. I’m on social media and I saw the story break the other day. But I’m just concentrating on the final on Monday. I think it would be stupid of me to be thinking about anything else, because I know what a special thing we can achieve. So that’s got my full focus and in the summer, that’s when we’ll sit down and talk about my future.<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool have been keeping a close eye on Wilson’s progress during his time at Pride Park]</b> There’s a loan guy, Jules <b>[Julian Ward]</b> that I keep in regular contact with, and he comes to some of the games. I speak to him and he feeds back to the manager at Liverpool <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b>. So I’m in regular contact but my full focus is on Monday<br /><br /><b>[If Wilson can help Derby County to return to the top tier, then it could be that a permanent transfer is discussed over the summer]</b> Obviously, every player wants to play at the top level - and the Premier League is the best league in the world. So if I could do that with Derby, it would be great, and we’ve got a great opportunity to do that. Like I said, in the summer is when I’ll sit down and discuss my options. But for now, I’m just doing all I can to make sure that I do have that option - of playing in the Premier League with Derby come next season</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Wilson is another to be impressed by the Derby boss Frank Lampard]</b> I think when your manager is such a legend in the game, you’ve got to take everything you can off him, whether it’s something to improve on or it’s a pat on the back. It is only going to benefit me because now I don’t necessarily play on the wing; I play either side, number 10, central midfield. There is a loan guy called Jools <b>[Julian Ward]</b>; I am in touch with him and he reports back to the <b>[Liverpool]</b> manager. I have had a few texts off <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b>. It’s good to know you are not being forgotten. I wanted to come to a good football team so I could showcase what I could do. Hopefully, the manager has seen the games on TV and I’ve made a good impression. I’ll go back there in pre-season; what happens from there I don’t know</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool winger Harry Wilson has completed a season-long loan move to Bournemouth]</b> It’s great to be here, great to finally get everything sorted and I can’t wait to meet all the staff and the lads. When Liverpool informed me it was a possibility to come here I was keen to get it sorted. I want to play Premier League football and with a great team like Bournemouth. With the style of play that Bournemouth are likely to play I feel that I can fit right in and help the team a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Wales forward Harry Wilson believes that his side had stretched their opponents that day - and could make it tough for them again, especially at home]</b> We know what a fantastic team Croatia are. But we went out there in the summer and, although we lost, we created chances. We know we’re good enough to create chances against them and it’s up to us to take them. We’ve got to recover now and make sure we’re ready for that game. We knew we had to come to Slovakia and not lose. That gives us a better head to head with Slovakia and that’s a big advantage. But all our focus now is on Sunday and getting the result we need</p>
