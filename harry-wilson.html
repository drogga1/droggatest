  <p><b>[Peter Edwards, a 62-year-old electrical contractor, after winning £125,000, on a £50 bet placed at odds of 2,500-1 in 2000, that his grandson Harry Wilson, then three, would play at senior international level for Wales]</b> My wife is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn’t be coming back. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet. He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk - that’s what gave me the idea</p>

  <p><b>[His loan spell with Hull City comes to an end today, but it’s been a productive one]</b> It’s gone brilliantly. It was something I wanted to do, something I needed to do, and I am glad I did it. I couldn’t have asked for much more really.<br /><br />I had a sit down with the manager at the beginning of January. I told him I felt I was ready for senior football, but with the first-team doing so well, with Salah and Mane scoring and assisting for fun, I knew it was going to be difficult for me to get in. I wanted to prove to a few people that I was able to do it in men’s football. The manager told me he likes me as a player and I was involved in the training group at Melwood, but I wanted to go out and get some games. I felt I was ready and the manager agreed. He’s great like that, whenever you talk to him he listens and gives you good advice. I felt comfortable speaking to him, which is important for a young player<br /><br /><b>[Had he stayed, Wilson could well have had his chance at Anfield]</b> Yeah, I have thought that. But you can’t have everything. Of course you look at the young lads on the bench for the derby, the likes of <b>[Dominic]</b> Solanke starting that game, and think maybe that could have been me. But then would I have got my Wales call up, would I have scored for my country had I stayed? I wouldn’t have had goals and assists in the Championship, would I? I wouldn’t be getting talked about positively, as I am now. It was the right decision for me, I needed it and I think the minutes I’ve played will be valuable for me, for pre-season and beyond<br /><br />It’s big for me. That was the frustration last season to be honest. I picked up an Achilles injury and it stopped me from expressing myself in pre-season. This year, I want to get on that tour, I want to get in the manager’s mind, train hard, train well, stay fit. If I do, then hopefully I’ll get my chance. If not, we’ll sit down and discuss our options<br /><br /><b>[On Roberto Firmino]</b> As a Liverpool fan, to see him and Mane scoring pretty much every game is great. But as a player, I want to be in that team! But I’d like to make myself that backup player for them, or that replacement if they have a knock or whatever. It sounds like a big aim, but why not? I want to play for Liverpool in the Premier League on a regular basis, I will never deny that<br /><br />It taught me a lot of valuable lessons. It gave me experiences that I would never have got by playing Academy football. I learned that in senior football it’s about managing the game. People are playing for contracts and playing for careers, so when you’re 1-0 up or 2-0 up, you have to see the game out. In Academy football, you’re getting told to play pretty much every time. When you come here you’re playing for three points rather than the performance. That was a massive thing to learn for me. At Hull, I’ve had that in my mind from the word go<br /><br />Numbers have always been massive to me. I was told at an early age that if you affect the game, and if your numbers are good in terms of goals, assists, chances created, the manager finds it hard to bring you off or to not involve you. I pride myself on that. Even if the team is not doing well and I can still pop up with a goal or an assist, then I’m making a difference<br /><br /><b>[Wilson tells a story from Euro 2016]</b> To see them on that stage only made me hungrier. I loved being around the fans and watching the lads. It was an incredible experience.<br /><br /><b>[Was he recognised?]</b> No, no. I had a hat on!</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Wilson has signed a new five-year contract at Liverpool]</b> I’m delighted to sign the new deal. When it got offered to me, I was desperate to get everything sorted so I could sign it fairly early on in pre-season because I want to focus on playing football. So, now this is sorted, I feel I can do that and push on and try and impress.<br /><br />I am concentrating on doing well every day in training and hoping that first team opportunities will come. The dream of mine is to play regularly for Liverpool’s first team. At the moment I am getting the chance to train at Melwood and get minutes in the friendlies and my aim is to impress the manager and stay here. If that’s not possible then we will weigh up the options and go from there. If you are in <b>[Klopp’s]</b> training squad then he’s given you the chance to impress him. I have to make sure I use that chance. Over the coming weeks I am sure we’ll sit down and see what the plans are<br /><br />As a Liverpool fan I was always watching the games even when I wasn’t here last season. I always watch Salah and Mane closely as they are the wingers. I look at what they do and see what I can take to add to my own game. Training with quality players helps you to become a better player. I’ve had a few chats with Mo and he’s a really nice guy. He’s always been really helpful to me. <b>[Hull]</b> was what I needed - a lot of minutes in a competitive league in the Championship. What I achieved while I was at Hull has given me a lot of confidence coming back to Liverpool. I always had the belief in my myself but I wanted to show people that I could handle that step up to senior football. Maybe there were a few doubts from my first loan about whether I could handle it. I was glad that I was able to go to Hull and prove those people wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Wilson is determined to be a Liverpool player]</b> The main focus this season is to get promoted with Derby. But Mason’s goal is to play for Chelsea and my goal is to play for Liverpool. I have always felt like a Liverpool player. Everything is going along the right path.<br /><br />I didn’t realise the goal at United was as good as it was because I went off celebrating. It wasn’t until I was on the bus on the way back here that I watched it on Twitter and saw the movement that I had got on it. With it being at Old Trafford made it even more special.<br /><br />Jurgen Klopp dropped me a text to tell me he’d watched it and he was delighted with the performance - and the goal! A couple of weeks ago there was another message saying, ‘Good result, good goal - keep going’. When you get those texts, it is a massive boost. You know you aren’t forgotten</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Wilson, on loan at Derby County from Liverpool, says he is ‘praying’ that his parent club can “get the job done]</b> It’s great watching from the outside and seeing the lads do so well. Only one defeat in the Premier League and any other season, they’d be top by a few points, but it’s just unfortunate that City are such a strong team this year as well. We’re still in the Champions League, which we always seem to do so well in, so as a Liverpool fan looking in, it’s great. I’m just praying that we get the job done and win the league. It’s where we want to be. Liverpool at the top end of the table and I’m here praying that they do it.<br /><br />I’d like to think there’s a lot more to my game than just free kicks. I feel when people watch the highlights, they only see the free kicks and goals, but I think I’ve improved my game over the course of the season. The favourite has to be the one at Old Trafford. Being a Liverpool fan and doing it at Old Trafford was a fantastic feeling for me. There’s also the one I scored for Wales against the Republic of Ireland. To do that in a competitive game for your country, with a young team against tough opposition, to see that fly in and it turn out to be the winner, it was a fantastic feeling. From the first day <b>[at Derby]</b>, the coaching staff, players and fans have been great with me. It’s been a good season and we’re still in the play-off picture. It’s up to us to finish the season strong. To be honest, we’re in such an important part of the season for Derby, that’s all I’m focused on. We’re maybe not as high as we wanted to be, but my full focus is on making sure we get into the play-offs and giving ourselves the best chance of getting into the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[inside Harry Wilson’s Derby loan spell]</b> It’s huge for any player. These are the games you want to play in, where everything is at stake and everyone is watching. It’s what you play football for. It’s a different kind of pressure to anything I’ve experienced. Playing for Wales or making my debut for Liverpool, it was excitement, a feeling of freedom even. This is different. You’ve worked all season to get into this position, and you know that one mistake can cost everything, or one piece of magic can make you a hero. It’s excitement of a different kind because the stakes are so high.<br /><br /><b>[Derby were left frustrated by Saturday’s first leg at Pride Park]</b> We felt hard done by. But we felt on our second-half performance that we have shown we can beat Leeds if we take our chances. We created a few opportunities and looked a lot more dangerous. We know it’ll be a real good atmosphere at Elland Road and we have to go there and play our game. If we can do that, we have a chance<br /><br /><b>[If Derby are to mount a comeback, Wilson is likely to be key]</b> It couldn’t have gone much better. There have been lots of high points - the best of which came at Old Trafford when we beat Manchester United in the Carabao Cup (Wilson scored that night with a 30-yard free-kick). It’s been hard at times too, but I’ve gained so much from this year. It was a difficult summer last year because there was so much interest, which is nice of course but it means you have a lot of thinking to do and a big decision to make. I spent a lot of time discussing my options with my agent and my family. I could have joined a number of clubs but it was when I spoke to the manager here that my mind was made up. He connected with me and I wanted to play for him. Obviously he was a legend as a player and for someone like me, an attacking player, it was something which appealed. I liked what he told me about the way he wanted his team to play, and the ambitions he had for the club<br /><br />He’s not a shouter, but he gets his point across and it really works well with him and his coaching staff. The sessions he puts on, they’re the type I imagine he would have enjoyed and benefited from as a player. You can see the influence of some of the coaches he worked under.<br /><br />Yeah that was big for me. Just before Christmas we had a few injuries and the manager asked me to slot in there. He showed me a few videos, some of David Silva for example, and spoke about how he plays centrally despite being pretty slight like me. It’s about using your body, being aware of your surroundings and playing with your head up. It was new to me in a way, because I’ve always been out wide. In the middle, you’re doing a lot of defensive work which goes unnoticed - cutting off angles, stopping passing lanes, covering when a team-mate presses. But I enjoyed it, and I was still involved in an attacking sense. Now I feel like a more complete player because I’ve seen a different position and how it works. That can only help me in the long run<br /><br /><b>[Wilson was back at Anfield last week to watch Jurgen Klopp’s side beat Barcelona in the Champions League]</b> It’s inspiring for me. Those occasions, those atmospheres, they’re what you dream of, you know? I want that, whether it’s at Liverpool, whether it’s somewhere else. I want it on Wednesday, when we go to Leeds. I want to experience those feelings and those emotions. I can’t wait<br /><br />I’d be foolish if I started looking too far ahead. I’m happy with how things have gone here, but when you’ve put so much into a campaign, like we all have at Derby, I’d be letting myself down if I was stood here thinking about the summer, or about next season or about what the future holds. No, it’s all about Leeds on Wednesday. And hopefully Wembley after that!</p>

I think it would be stupid of me to be thinking about anything else, because I know what a special thing we can achieve. So that’s got my full focus and in the summer, that’s when we’ll sit down and talk about my future.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have been keeping a close eye on Wilson’s progress during his time at Pride Park]</b> There’s a loan guy, Jules <b>[Julian Ward]</b> that I keep in regular contact with, and he comes to some of the games.

So I’m in regular contact but my full focus is on Monday<br /><br /><b>[If Wilson can help <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> to return to the top tier, then it could be that a permanent transfer is discussed over the summer]</b> Obviously, every player wants to play at the top level - and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best league in the world. So if I could do that with Derby, it would be great, and we’ve got a great opportunity to do that. Like I said, in the summer is when I’ll sit down and discuss my options.
