  <p><b>[Peter Edwards, a 62-year-old electrical contractor, after winning £125,000, on a £50 bet placed at odds of 2,500-1 in 2000, that his grandson Harry Wilson, then three, would play at senior international level for Wales]</b> My wife is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn’t be coming back. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet. He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk - that’s what gave me the idea</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> I spoke with the gaffer and we all know what a fantastic number eight he was. He’s not a bad person to learn from!<br /><br /><b>[The Welsh youngster also praised the influence that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has had on his development in his breakthrough season in English football with the Rams]</b> He gave me a few tips on how to play there and just told me to get on the ball as much as I can - and when we haven’t got the ball, try to get out and press. I tried to do that and if he needs me to play there again, I can do that</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool winger Harry Wilson has completed a season-long loan move to Bournemouth]</b> It’s great to be here, great to finally get everything sorted and I can’t wait to meet all the staff and the lads. When Liverpool informed me it was a possibility to come here I was keen to get it sorted. I want to play Premier League football and with a great team like Bournemouth. With the style of play that Bournemouth are likely to play I feel that I can fit right in and help the team a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Wales forward Harry Wilson believes that his side had stretched their opponents that day - and could make it tough for them again, especially at home]</b> We know what a fantastic team Croatia are. But we went out there in the summer and, although we lost, we created chances. We know we’re good enough to create chances against them and it’s up to us to take them. We’ve got to recover now and make sure we’re ready for that game. We knew we had to come to Slovakia and not lose. That gives us a better head to head with Slovakia and that’s a big advantage. But all our focus now is on Sunday and getting the result we need</p>
