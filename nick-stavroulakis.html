<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar have received a warning ahead of their AFC Champions League play-off versus Shanghai Shenhua that Carlos Tevez looks to be at his sharpest]</b> There were certain moments where both of them were tracking back or trying to make a tackle. There were moments where they were trying to combine with their team-mates at all costs, so if they’re not at their sharpest, they’ve very close to it.<br /><br /><b>[Stavroulakis added of Tevez’s goal]</b> He took about 60 minutes to get a shot on target and in that 60th minute he had no space to work with, one touch, no back lift, with two players on him and he’s found the top corner<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the club’s trip to China]</b> It’s probably put the club back on the map.<br /><br />I feel that they’re going to have to be more defensive minded, and being able to play on a block first and foremost, not to allow space in behind for Tevez and Martins to be able to run around in the front third. But in saying that, I still feel there are certain players at Roar, who can unlock the defence of Shanghai as well</p>
