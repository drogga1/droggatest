  <p><b>[Akhyar Rashid wants to reach AFF U-18 final]</b> My personal target is to reach the final match. This is because we haven’t reached that far previously. So I hope we can create history by reaching the final this year, God willing.<br /><br />My parents have visited me before, but they went off to celebrate Aidiladha in Melaka. I do feel a little sad about not getting to celebrate it with them, because I haven’t been with the whole family for about two months! I have been away for the AFC U23 Championship qualifiers, the SEA Games and then now the U18 AFF. Yesterday <b>[Friday]</b> we visited one of the coaches’ house, and then returned to the dorm to celebrate it quietly among ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Akhyar Rashid admits that it stings to have lost in two final matches to the Thais in the space of a month]</b> Although we only trained together for three weeks, we managed to develop our team spirit. I’m very proud of my teammates because we can develop a cohesive unit in such a short time. If we can train for longer, I believe the team will play even better. Our group <b>[in the AFC qualification]</b> will be a tough one; there’ll be South Korea and Indonesia, but we still have a chance because we are a good side. We have to work hard, because I want to qualify <b>[for the finals]</b>.<br /><br />We lacked chemistry somewhat throughout the tournament, because I only trained with them twice and my teammates only trained together for two weeks. Ahead of South Korea, I hope we can begin training earlier so we can work on our chemistry. But we’ll definitely do our best.<br /><br /><b>[He admitted that he is a little disappointed to have lost twice in two separate final matches to the Thais]</b> It stings a little having lost twice to Thailand, but I believe my time will come. I’ve given my all in the competition, but it just wasn’t meant to be</p>
