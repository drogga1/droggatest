<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Neymar occupies the same talent bracket as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> They are different. Mentally, Cristiano Ronaldo is a killer. Ten years at this level, with the same desire, no one has ever seen that. People outside of football cannot understand that but for us players, it inspires respect. Messi is a gift from God. Neymar is the same - younger but just as hardworking. If you don’t have that then you cannot be at this level.<br /><br />With Sevilla, I played against the best players in the world. Finding yourself against Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar allows you to progress in concentration, physically and tactically. You learn to pay attention to everything on the pitch. Neymar <b>[was the most difficult to mark]</b>. In Spain, he impressed me with the ball. He was the fastest at Barca, while Messi decided the fate of the match with a quick attack or a free kick. Cristiano Ronaldo is the complete player. He has such charisma that he takes up a lot of space in his side. With <b>[Gareth]</b> Bale and <b>[Karim]</b> Benzema, Real were loaded with talent<br /><br /><b>[In Spain]</b> he was taking so many blows that I can understand him. Sometimes he’s scared. It’s up to him to find a happy medium to avoid adding any more injuries. We must protect this kind of player<br /><br /><b>[On Kylian Mbappe]</b> To be honest, I’m relieved not to play against him. What he does, at 19 years old and with such ease, is so impressive. I hope that he is aware that the future belongs to him</p>
