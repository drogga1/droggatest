  <p><b>[Darius Vassell shares an extract about his time in Turkey playing for Ankaragucu]</b> We travelled to the ground on the team coach and stopped outside our stadium for a goat to be sacrificed before the game. It was just the staff and players around. I felt like the goat looked at me just before and as I’d said at the time, via my blog, it was the point in time when I realised that I was most definitely an animal lover. I know I’m being dramatic but I’ve seen a lot from the seat of a coach during the years, but this was certainly new</p>

  <p><b>[Darius Vassell says <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> will go the same way as <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> &amp; Gareth Barry]</b> I always get asked about <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>’s situation. I want him to stay through supporting Villa - he’s one of our own. But he’s so good now, where could he end up if he went to a better team with better players? Is it right to hold him back? If you look at history, you’ve got Gareth Barry and <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> who left for City. Top quality players went on to bigger and better things. So I think it’s a matter of time. He’s so good, how can other teams not be tempted to come in and steal him? I don’t like saying it but he’s got to go at some point. Unless Villa get new owners and are buying the best players, go and get the most for your career. I don’t think Villa fans would blame him - he’s played his heart out and done brilliantly. At the end of the day, I wouldn’t be surprised</p>
