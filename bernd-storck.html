  <p><b>[Hungary remain the underdogs to qualify for Euro 2016 despite their first-leg play-off win]</b> Norway remain favourites - they have excellent players. We need to play like we did today, or we will have problems <b>[in Budapest on Sunday]</b>. We are in a good position <b>[leading 1-0 after the first leg]</b>. We did this for Hungarian football. We want to complete this job on Sunday - we need success</p>

  <p><b>[Hungary coach Bernd Storck believes his team deserve their place at Euro 2016 after overcoming Norway in their play-off on Sunday]</b> We have many players who don’t play regularly with their clubs, but I trust them - they play with confidence and without fear. The level and intensity of their play was amazing today, and I think we deserve 100 per cent to go to France. We took the right strategy today and in Oslo, and that was the key to our success.<br /><br /><b>[He also believes his decision to hand Laszlo Kleinheisler a debut in the first leg - when the midfielder scored the winner - has been justified]</b> I’d like to congratulate my team. They played very well; not just tonight, but over the past few weeks, and the foundations for tonight were laid last Thursday. I took some risks in Oslo; <b>[Kleinheisler]</b> was new, but I was convinced he could play at this level</p>

  <p><b>[Hungary boss Bernd Storck felt his side’s last-gasp equaliser against Iceland was reward for their attacking mindset]</b> We are very happy with our game today and we are happy with the late goal. It was lucky but we deserved it, we dominated the game. We tried to create chances but we couldn’t create much. I’d like to compliment my side, they never gave up and deserved this point. We risked everything in the second half as we had to attack. We had just three at the back and put Daniel Bode and Adam Szalai in attack and we were rewarded for that<br /><br /><b>[Storck also praised Iceland, the minnows defending bravely until the closing stages]</b> We played against very strong opposition. Portugal tried very hard against this defence <b>[in a 1-1 draw on Tuesday]</b>. They have a lot of experience and that is why it was difficult to create chances. Other sides had the same problems, considering what they did in qualifying. They are a top team and that’s why you will never have too many chances against them<br /><br /><b>[Storck hoped they could now look forward with optimism rather than back at the glory days of the 1950s]</b> It <b>[the history]</b> was like a shadow when I started here as manager, people still remain in the past but we have to support this new generation and give them a little time. We have been very successful up to now but there is a lot of work ahead of us.</p>
