He will be at a great club with a great manager who knows how to work with young players. It’s the right step</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Bierhoff satisfied with ‘doable’ Euro 2016 draw after Germany pitted against Poland]</b> We sure were lucky. We wanted to avoid Italy badly but of course we have to take each opponent seriously. Northern Ireland are a personal favourite of mine as I scored my fastest hat-trick against them</p>

  <p><b>[Philipp Lahm making a comeback to Germany duty would be impossible]</b> I talked to him some time ago, but not specifically on this topic. However, those who know Philipp, who read his statements, who speak personally with him, know that this is impossible. We should all respect his decision.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff has said that no action will be taken against Bayern Munich defender Mats Hummels after he posted a video of himself jumping off a balcony into a swimming pool earlier this week]</b> We already said it was good he did not dive head first. That would have even been worse. We are not the social media police for the players, and that’s the case outside international breaks. But we have to tell them that with everything they say or do, they will be considered role models and you have to have responsibly with that. Mats is a player who usually thinks a lot and I will not exaggerate. But we tell him that.</p>

  <p><b>[How Bayern legend Muller can pile pressure on Ancelotti]</b> I hope that Bayern is aware of the fact that he is a figure people identify with the club. I wish that they would say as a club. People come to the stadium for him, he has unbelievable qualities. And precisely as a striker you need some support.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany international Oliver Bierhoff believes Joachim Low’s team selection could be influenced by a row over Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan’s involvement in a photo taken with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan]</b> Jogi <b>[Low]</b> does not make any populist decisions just to satisfy someone, he rather looks at the sporting side of things. But <b>[the scandal]</b> could as well be a small aspect <b>[in the decision-making process]</b>.<br /><br />It’s obvious that the discussion over integration should not end here, and also not that over the photo. We must continue to face this issue and account for it. We have a lot of players in our academies with a migrant background. This goes far beyond the Erdogan photo. But my request is only to allow the players to focus on the tournament during the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Germany national team public relations manager Oliver Bierhoff has criticised Mesut Ozil]</b> We never forced any player of the national team to do something, but we always tried to convince them. We haven’t succeeded with Mesut. That’s why we should have thought about leaving him out from a sporting point of view. I think the fact that Mesut and Ilkay took these pictures did not keep the team busy. But the debate afterwards did. Looking back now, I would try to be clearer regarding this topic.<br /><br />What has contributed to a 14-year success story must not be ignored, but it is clear that we have to put everything to the test, both in terms of personnel and structure. This includes the composition of the squad as well as the internal processes. There must be cuts at all levels, we did not present ourselves as a team in Russia, that’s something that hurts me a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Bierhoff says Germany should keep faith in old guard despite Nations League relegation]</b> Germany should keep faith in old guard despite Nations League relegation. Of course, you always try to use the players in the best form and the young players have shown in recent games that you can bet on them. But our experienced players have given a lot to the national team and also made a positive contribution to the group, so we will need them too.</p>

  <p><b>[Joachim Low has confirmed that Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller will no longer be considered for international selection]</b> Our job is to decide what’s best for the team on the way back to the top of the world. We now want to consistently make the new beginning visible in the squad. Thomas, Mats and Jerome have achieved great things for German football so far and will continue to do so in their club. I still feel very close to them and I’m grateful for the time together in the national team.</p>
