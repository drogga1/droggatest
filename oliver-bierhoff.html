  <p><b>[When <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> decided his preference for Angel Di Maria, Bierhoff realised it was in Germany’s interests that <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> switch to a club where he would be a guaranteed starter]</b> It’s not good if you feel that your old team doesn’t stand behind you a 100 per cent. He will be at a great club with a great manager who knows how to work with young players. It’s the right step</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Bierhoff on <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> reaction after <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> photos]</b> We never forced any player of the national team to do something, but we always tried to convince them. We haven’t succeeded with Mesut. That’s why we should have thought about leaving him out from a sporting point of view<br /><br />I think the fact that Mesut and Ilkay took these pictures did not keep the team busy. But the debate afterwards did. Looking back now, I would try to be clearer regarding this topic<br /><br />What has contributed to a 14-year success story must not be ignored, but it is clear that we have to put everything to the test, both in terms of personnel and structure<br /><br />This includes the composition of the squad as well as the internal processes. There must be cuts at all levels, we did not present ourselves as a team in Russia, that’s something that hurts me a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Bierhoff says Germany should keep faith in old guard despite Nations League relegation]</b> Germany should keep faith in old guard despite Nations League relegation. Of course, you always try to use the players in the best form and the young players have shown in recent games that you can bet on them. But our experienced players have given a lot to the national team and also made a positive contribution to the group, so we will need them too.</p>
