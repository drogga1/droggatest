<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Selangor defender Robert Cornthwaite has described Malaysian football as lacking in professionalism] Malaysian football is another world. As a foreigner, you must look after yourself. There are a lot of things that will not be up to standard. Foreign coaches face similar problems. If you try to change too much, then players can turn against you. There is a real lack of professionalism and if you are late to training, the punishment was to buy KFC for the whole team. Not what you would expect from a professional football team.</p>

  <p>[Robert Cornthwaite has defended Western Sydney Wanderers’ decision to sack coach Josep Gombau] Obviously it’s not nice for anyone to get the sack. But from a personal point of view I think the club has made the right decision. I think it was obvious the players weren’t responding to his methods or his way of doing things.<br /><br />Although you can say they weren’t his players, you’ve got to work with what you have and I don’t think he was able to adapt. I think moving forward it’s definitely the correct decision from the club. You can see the players weren’t happy, they weren’t happy day to day going to training</p>
