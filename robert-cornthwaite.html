  <p><b>[Former Selangor defender Robert Cornthwaite has described Malaysian football as lacking in professionalism]</b> Malaysian football is another world. As a foreigner, you must look after yourself. There are a lot of things that will not be up to standard. Foreign coaches face similar problems. If you try to change too much, then players can turn against you. There is a real lack of professionalism and if you are late to training, the punishment was to buy KFC for the whole team. Not what you would expect from a professional football team.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Selangor defender Robert Cornthwaite has opened up on the tragedy that befell him and his family during his time with the Red Giants back in 2016]</b> Nel was 22 weeks with our second daughter and was feeling off for about 48 hours. Never did we imagine it was the early signs of premature labour. The doctors told us Nel had contracted a virus and that her body felt the baby was in danger and began the labour although there was nothing wrong with our girl. She was a perfectly healthy 22-week-old baby. Being told there was nothing to stop the labour and that our baby girl, Minnie, would be born at just 22 weeks was just devastating news. It was difficult to comprehend. We were at one of their top hospitals and there was nothing the doctors could do. Although Minnie never took a breath, we were able to hold her and talk to her. We told her how much we loved her and how blessed we were to have her as our baby. She was tiny, fragile and so precious. I’ll never forget the time we shared.<br /><br />I still wanted to be there for Minnie and be the best dad I could be, I didn’t want her to ever be alone. I organised her cremation that day. I didn’t want her in a morgue. I wanted to do everything for her. I put her tiny body in her coffin and travelled to the crematorium alone <b>[while his wife was in hospital]</b>. Seeing a baby-sized coffin will be an image I will never forget. It made me feel so helpless. I spoke to her and said a few final words on behalf of Nel and I. It was the hardest thing I’ll ever do. But I’m glad I did it. I did it for Minnie. I brought her ashes back to Australia with us<br /><br />I remember calling my dad in Australia and breaking down on the phone. I sat in my car at the side of the road in a foreign country and knew I had to be strong for Nel. I was thankful that I wasn’t away with the team, that I was there for Nel. I couldn’t imagine what it would have been like for her having to cope with that alone. I guess these things <b>[the injury]</b> happened for a reason<br /><br />The reason I want to help raise money is so that men in my situation have somewhere to turn if they need to. I still have moments when it all comes back to me and I’m not sure how long that will last. There can be a lot of guilt involved and for me speaking about what happened has help immensely. It’s often a taboo subject, especially miscarriage. Unfortunately, it’s such a common occurrence and men and women suffer in silence. bearsof­hope.org.au and now beardsof­hope.com.au do such wonderful work to help grieving parents. I just want to make a difference</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Cornthwaite has defended Western Sydney Wanderers’ decision to sack coach Josep Gombau]</b> Obviously it’s not nice for anyone to get the sack. But from a personal point of view I think the club has made the right decision. I think it was obvious the players weren’t responding to his methods or his way of doing things.<br /><br />Although you can say they weren’t his players, you’ve got to work with what you have and I don’t think he was able to adapt. I think moving forward it’s definitely the correct decision from the club. You can see the players weren’t happy, they weren’t happy day to day going to training</p>
