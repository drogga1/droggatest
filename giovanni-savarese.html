  <p><b>[North American Soccer League side New York Cosmos have returned to life, a month after they shut down]</b> We are not starting from zero. We are starting from minus five. What happened after the championship has been very, very difficult. I cannot hide that. Some players were in a very difficult situation. I’m just glad that now they will be able to get paid. I’m glad that the Cosmos will be able to continue.<br /><br />We are trying to talk to a lot of <b>[the players]</b> to explain how the new era of this new ownership is trying to rebuild the club. We are fortunate that some of the guys have already accepted to come back, but definitely we have a lot of work and not a lot of time to be able to do it,</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers have signed Peru international Andy Polo on loan from Liga MX side Monarcas Morelia]</b> Andy is a versatile, young player who will add another element to our attack, and we believe that he has further upside to his development. Andy has strong technical ability and is able to stretch opponents and run in behind defenses. He will provide us with another quality option as a winger, and we are very pleased to add him to the team this season.</p>

I thought they showed a lot of discipline, they worked together, the communication was very good, and I thought we created some interesting opportunities and we could have gotten a little bit more from the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Saturday’s collapse raised fresh questions about the state of the Timbers]</b> I have to take responsibility for the result. I take the full blame of the result and the players gave me everything. They’ve been traveling five games away at the end we were tired. It was a long trip. The weather from snow to hot and you can see at the end the guys were breaking down all over the place because its been a long five games away. But as I said, I take full responsibility for this defeat.</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Savarese said after Saturday’s win]</b> I think the unity has been much better. Everybody’s covering each other, everybody is working for each other. They sacrifice defensively, and they believe offensively, so I think that’s the key factor so far. We need to continue to grow, but I’m seeing growth game by game.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers ready for tight battle with FC Dallas]</b> I think we are comfortable in possession, more than they are. I think they’re a little bit more direct than we are. They also in some way are frustrated with the fact that they’re coming into this game in a situation where they thought they were going to come in first or second, so they feel they have no business having to play this game. I think that could affect them mentally.<br /><br />Even if we won the game, we couldn’t avoid playing on Wednesday or Thursday. Yes, we could’ve played at home, which would’ve been fantastic, but the reality is that it was not in our control, the possibility to be able to skip the game - not like Seattle, Kansas City, Dallas and LAFC - the four teams had the option by winning and some results going their way not having to play on Wednesday or Thursday<br /><br />We have to make sure that we are ready for what we’re going to encounter tomorrow, that we have to battle, that we have to sacrifice, that we have to try to go through and then we think about the next game. There’s no point in right now thinking about something that is still not there. We’re on a good path, but we have to battle tomorrow in order to get to the second game</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Valeri gives Timbers star power needed to push past FC Dallas]</b> I think that was a moment where the team knew how to be smart and keep its discipline. They made sure to make it difficult for them. When we had the chance to go forward, we were quick and able to react fast. Ebobisse did a fantastic job to find Valeri and was clinical enough to score the second goal.<br /><br />Valeri found a second goal that was very, very important. He worked some magic again. Big players know how to be important in big games and he did a great job today</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ebobisse breaking out at just the right time for Timbers]</b> I’ve always said that forwards need to work hard and to make sure they help defensively and then that they can also give us the way to find opportunities going forward. <b>[Ebobisse]</b> worked very, very hard through the entire match to be available, to match up, to hold the ball, to link up, to attack the spaces, to create chances and also go all the way back to midfield to make sure that they didn’t find the midfielders. And that was very important from his part and from <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri’s part as well. Unfortunately he tried to find some things in there and he couldn’t, but his performance was very good today..</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Savarese poised to cap smooth transition to MLS with another title]</b> Every situation has its own challenges. Whether you start fresh, or go to a situation where the club wasn’t doing well, or take over a team that was doing well, each scenario brings its own difficulties. Just because the team was successful doesn’t mean it was on a path I felt was the right path. There was a lot of work to be done. Players need to trust a coach, and need to know how a coach is, and how a coach works. Trust isn’t built overnight.<br /><br />When you become a coach I think a very important part is to be balanced emotionally and believe in what you do and the work you do. You need an organization that really believes in you and gives you the trust to continue to go forward. I had concerns those first two games, but by the third game I felt like we were turning things around. By the third or fourth game I felt like the win would come at any minute<br /><br />I spent time working with Charlie Stilitano, spending time around big European clubs in America on tour. When teams would come to the United States, being with Barcelona, with Porto and Fiorentina, being able to be with them the whole tour, seeing how their coaches work, how their organizations work, being in Barcelona for a week, with Milan and Inter and seeing how they work. It all taught me so much. It helped me learn so much, and I’ve never stopped learning<br /><br />The split at the time wasn’t a comfortable moment due to the fact that I was very passionate about what I was doing, and I was doing it for a club that I played for. I gave everything I had, and wanted to continue to give everything, so to split from the organization was difficult because of the passion I had for the job, and the club<br /><br />I wouldn’t say that that sparked something in me that I wanted to prove anything because I’m not that way. I’m just a competitor, I compete. I don’t need any extra motivation to compete. I believe in what I do because I do it with passion. I know my strengths and weaknesses. It’s not about proving people wrong<br /><br />I think losing sometimes teaches more than winning, because sometimes when you win you let some things go because you’re getting results. When the results aren’t the ones you want you become critical. In that time, I learned more about my team. I learned how the team dealt with adversity. We needed to learn that we win together and lose together<br /><br />I wouldn’t have imagined that in Atlanta, definitely not five years ago. To see things change here the way they have, big credit to Atlanta United for creating something so amazing. We’re going to enjoy it because we’re going to be able to play in front of a beautiful crowd. The team knows how special this opportunity will be</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United versus Portland Timbers has distinct Latin American flavor]</b> I think the eyes of South America have always been on this league, but now there’s more credibility. Every year MLS earns more credibility in South America, and now you see more people looking at MLS as a priority league for them to be able to live, when maybe in the past they had other ideas as their priority.</p>
