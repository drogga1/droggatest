  <p><b>[Henderson delighted with Liverpool reaction after January slump]</b> You’ve got to stick together. It’s a tough time when you haven’t won for so long and the performance level hasn’t been up to standard, but you’ve got to keep fighting and keep believing. I felt we’ve done that. As players, we take responsibility. We felt as though we’ve let ourselves down, the manager down and the fans down. To put in that performance doesn’t make up for it, but it’s a start and a step in the right direction. I feel as though we’ve always had confidence, we’ve always had belief. The performances in recent weeks haven’t been up to the standard that we’ve set ourselves and we’ve been punished really. To then perform like we did, I think everyone stood up and showed great character and put in a solid performance to get a good result. Now, we just have to make sure we do it consistently until the end of the season.<br /><br />The most pleasing thing I think was the second half - how we were solid and took the sting out of the game. We did a lot of good things without the ball as well as with it. Simon <b>[Mignolet]</b> made a brilliant save which kept us at 2-0 so that was a crucial moment, but overall I thought we defended well as a team and attacked well as a team in a strong performance. We created some good chances early on. Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> was brilliant! They couldn’t live with his pace in behind, supported by Roberto <b>[Firmino]</b> and Phil <b>[Coutinho]</b>. The intensity and work rate was everything we wanted. We had a good week of training leading into it and I think we put everything from those sessions into the game. It worked perfectly. From start to finish we were very good. We need to make sure we do that every week<br /><br />I wouldn’t question the attitude of the players, the attitude is good throughout the squad. There is one or two things that we do need to work on that we did this week in training that can help us going forward. Like I said, I felt that everyone stayed together and worked hard. I believe we have fantastic quality in the team, great mentality, great character. It’s not good me just saying that though, it’s up to us to show that from now to the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson has revealed he has not needed to manage his workload having participated in every training session on Liverpool’s pre-season tour of Hong Kong following a foot injury]</b> I haven’t managed it. I’ve trained every day since I’ve been back totally fine. Obviously, I’ve been tired at times but that’s pre- season - everybody is I’m sure. I’m really enjoying just being back. I couldn’t be happier to just be training here, working really hard and, obviously, just playing games. Hopefully, I can just be injury-free and keep doing what I keep doing. Hopefully, we have a successful season as a team.<br /><br />Of course, it gives me extra confidence. I feel stronger every training session, every game, so hopefully I can keep progressing, keep working hard and then come first game of the season, hopefully I’m right back to full fitness<br /><br />I can do a lot better, especially in the games that I’ve played. I know I can improve on a lot more things. For me, it’s just working hard as I possibly can and then doing the best I can for the team and what the manager needs us to do. That’s what I try and do every time I play. I’ve had good moments in the games, but not-so-good moments<br /><br />I think I’m just easing my way back from being out for a decent period of time. I feel good. Probably the best I felt was in the game the other night. I’m getting more and more confident each time I play</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson does not subscribe to the idea that Liverpool’s fear factor has increased following their 5-0 dismantling of Porto]</b> I think before this game, I am not sure how many teams would have wanted to play us anyway, because when we are on it, like we were, we are very hard to play against - but that has to be our norm. We have to be consistent with our performances and to continue getting results like this. I thought we started the game really well, very aggressive, very brave. We pressed up high to get the ball back. We defended well the whole game, and with the quality we have going forward, we were clinical as well.<br /><br />We knew after half-time they would have a go, so it was about staying calm and keep playing our football. We knew we would create more chances if we could find the right spaces and we managed to do that. It was a great performance and a good result<br /><br />It is a lot of goals. Hopefully we can get more. At the same time we need to make sure we get clean sheets like we did here. Virgil <b>[van Dijk]</b> has been brilliant since he has come in, but again, the whole back four was very good. The team defended from the front</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson is happy to divide opinion in the eyes of those who continue to question his value as successor to Steven Gerrard]</b> I don’t think it is a question of feeling appreciated because I don’t think that matters. I think that is the way it has been my whole career. There have always been questions: is he good enough to play for Sunderland? Is he good enough to be in the team there? Then, when I moved to Liverpool, is the price tag too big? Is he good enough? I feel I have answered the question but then there will always be another one and that is a good thing. That is healthy. That is me pushing myself to my limits and beyond, really. My goal is to always reach for more. At times people can criticise the way I play as a No. 6 and say I am better further forward but, at the end of the day, the manager has huge belief in playing me in that role or he wouldn’t play me there. And he would tell me if I wasn’t doing things right. I would rather people question me than questioning any of my teammates. I know that I can handle that, I have been through that before and I know that it won’t change the way I think. A lot of the younger players, who maybe haven’t experienced that as much, may find it difficult..</p>

  <p><b>[Unbelievable Mohamed Salah lifting Liverpool like Luis Suarez did]</b> They are both fantastic players in their own right and you can’t compare them. They are different players. I know they score a lot of goals and both work hard off the ball but it is very difficult to make that comparison. Luis moved on to Barcelona and is doing fantastically well. He is a fantastic player who I was privileged to play with. But Mo this season has been unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. He is doing it every week, without fail.<br /><br />It’s the confidence. You have someone like Mo who does the hardest part of the game, which is putting the ball in the back of the net. Then, as a team, if we work as hard as we possibly can, Mo <b>[is]</b> going to finish it in the final third. We had that with Luis. You know when you are walking out there are so many goals out there for you</p>

They beat Barcelona 3-0 and they are a top team. It will be a difficult game both home and away. I’ve watched them a few times and they have got some very good players and a very good team. It will be a tough test, as it always would be in the semi-final of the Champions League, but it is a challenge for us to go in there being confident with the way we have been playing, especially in the last round.<br /><br />It is a young team but I feel they are mature at the same time and are hungry to want more, learn and improve and that is the biggest</p>

Definitely this season in terms of the way he’s played, the goals he’s scored and the impact he’s had on games, means he’s up there with the best<br /><br />He came in during the summer, settled in really well during pre-season and straight away we knew we had a top player. He was amazing in training and during the pre-season games and has continued that form throughout the season. He’s been fantastic on and off the field. When he joined from Roma, we expected him to be good but he’s gone above and beyond that</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson claims leaving Liverpool was never an option for him]</b> Brendan called me in and said ‘Listen, this is the offer’ and he asked me what I thought. It implied to me that he would let me leave and it was up to me. I went back to my room. I shed a few tears. I ended up crying a little bit because it hurt so much. I had the game that night to think about it as well. I spoke to my agent and told him what had happened and I said I didn’t want to go. I wanted to stay and fight and try and improve and try to prove the manager wrong. My agent agreed. I spoke to my dad. He was gutted but he backed my decision to stay and fight. From that point, I just kept my head down. I knew I wouldn’t get as much game time as I wanted but I still had faith. I was young enough to get my head down, keep working hard, do my extra bits and prove them wrong and I feel I managed to do that by the time Brendan left. There are always those moments in football - and life in general - which can decide the path and the route you go down. For me it was never an option to leave.<br /><br />I don’t like reading good things about myself. With the criticism and the negative things, I always think that makes me better. You need a little bit of good now and again but the good for me comes from the manager. That’s the good I enjoy, so if I’m told I’m doing my job right, brilliant. Anything outside of that, I tend not to get involved. I’m not particularly into people giving me credit. It’s not something I think about. It’s not important to me. The only thing that’s important is if I’m doing my job properly on the pitch for the team and for the manager. I can always accept criticism. Throughout my career, I’ve always had criticism and I think that’s good. Criticism’s healthy. It gives you that extra little bit inside you to prove people wrong, to use it as energy, to use it as fuel</p>

I feel it’s been a progressive journey for me throughout my time here and one I’ve enjoyed so much. There is no other place in the world I would rather play football. I want to be here for as long as I can be. I’m so privileged to have been a part of this club for so long, and hopefully even longer now.</p>

I think we did better than what people may have thought we were going to do but at the same time I felt as though we were good enough to go even further and possibly challenge to win it. We can use the confidence that we went and performed in a lot of games in a massive tournament, but we can also use the other bit of the disappointment to want to keep going and want to keep pushing the boundaries. It’s definitely the message since we’ve come back that we can use that disappointment that we had at the end by not quite getting over the line and use that as fuel to keep going and hopefully get to a final and win a trophy soon.<br /><br />Anything can happen in the final. It doesn’t matter who you’re playing. France are a fantastic side, don’t get me wrong, and so are Croatia, who got there as well. You never know, hopefully we’ll find out one day in a final and hopefully that day’s not too far away</p>

He had another one or two chances that maybe he would have liked to have scored but I thought he looked sharp. He was lively and he’s always a threat on the counter-attack. He’s a fantastic young player so he just needs to keep learning, keep improving. He’s a big part of our team. We have got plenty of other good strikers like Rashford. <b>[Danny Welbeck]</b> came on and he’s been doing fantastically well in training, so hopefully it gives them an opportunity now.<br /><br /><b>[England lost their first game since finishing fourth at the World Cup]</b> We still feel confident, but we still feel like we are learning. You want to play against the best teams and the best players to learn from the experiences. It is very powerful to go out when the atmosphere is brilliant so we have to keep putting performances in to keep that spirit there. We have to keep working hard. There’s still a long way to where we want to get to, but there are still positives to take even though we are disappointed with the final result</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson says that England’s players and fans still have their World Cup semi-final defeat in the back of their minds as Croatia visit Wembley Stadium]</b> I think in football you’ve got to move on. It’s about development. It’s about us as a team. It’s not about anyone else. I think deep down you’ll always have it in the back of your mind because it’s a huge moment for many of us. Well for all of us really to lose that game, of course, so it’s always inside. But I feel as though since then we’ve bounced back brilliantly. We’ve won some big games, some good games, especially last camp so it’s another big test for us. They’re a good side.<br /><br />We need to take a lot of confidence from that going into Sunday and use it as much as we can to get the right result. I’m sure you will make it big <b>[the media]</b>! It’s a nice story for you isn’t it! But no, for us as a team we’ll always have it inside. It’s a World Cup semi-final no matter who it was against. But like I say, since then I feel as though we’ve come so far and we need to go and produce that again on Sunday and then, after the game, we can hopefully say a lot of positive things because it could get us to a semi-final again. And that’s all our focus will be on, but it’ll be tough because they’re a fantastic team. I think we’ve reacted really well after the World Cup. I think it would have been easy just to sort of think, ‘Yeah we had a decent World Cup’, and go through the motions, but the first camp back we were straight back at it. We knew we had to improve on a lot to go further in tournaments and to get to finals to win competitions. We knew we had a decent World Cup but we felt we could have done better, so I think that’s sort of spurred us on to keep going since then</p>

In his overall play, he is comfortable on the ball and he helps build up play from the back. He drives the ball forward, which is big for us. I thought he was outstanding, along with everybody else really.<br /><br />We are not really interested in City, to be honest, because there is a long way to go. We know how good they are, we expect them to win. We just expect ourselves to win games and perform to the level that we have been - and if we do that we can keep winning. But we just focus on game by game and it doesn’t really matter about anybody else.

They’re fighting, though we all are. As a team we’re fighting to win the game. We knew Burnley were an aggressive team and they’ve got some good players. They want to win. Of course, there’s a couple of tackles that could have went either way but they’ve managed to get the ball and that makes all the difference. I’m not really sure what happened with Joe, but I thought we reacted well. We kept playing the ball. If you lose your head you can pick up cards.

I can definitely see that the maturity has helped us win games and keep clean sheets. But our style of play is there for everybody to see. We’re still an exciting team to watch, we want to be at a high intensity level. We want to score goals as well as defend well, that has never changed. The maturity in certain games has been much better this season.<br /><br />We have defended very well - we’ve got a lot of clean sheets this season. To win trophies, you need to have that really, along with the attacking power and goals we’ve got. So far, it has been a good combination and we need to keep that going for the rest of the season if we want to do something really special. So far it has been good - hopefully it can get better, we can keep improving and keep winning games<br /><br />It’s about focusing on what’s important.

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson claims Naby Keita has come through Liverpool struggles]</b> Everybody can see how good Naby is as a footballer. But as I know myself coming to Liverpool, it’s such a huge club and especially changing to the Premier League, it’s tough. It takes time to adapt. He has done really well in certain games he has played. I can see him getting used to the way we play and the manager is helping him improve. I can definitely see the potential coming out of him. But it takes time to feel right at home, but over the last couple of games you can see the quality he gives the team and how good he is.<br /><br /><b>[On Virgil van Dijk]</b> He is a massive miss, he has played almost every game this season. You can see how important he is for us as a team. At the same time, I feel as though we have enough quality in the team to be able to cope with it and not be relying on our two centre-halves to defend, it’s up to the whole team to do it together. Whoever plays there I’m sure will know the role and what’s expected of them but of course he will be a big loss</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will not bend the knee to anyone]</b> They’re a squad packed with experience and top-class quality, a club for whom we have the utmost respect. We know how tough a challenge they will pose us over the course of these two legs. But I think that we made a statement in the last campaign about what the European Cup means to us and how we don’t bend the knee to anyone else in it.<br /><br />We go into every round with only one outcome in our minds and that’s us getting through. People talk about us being ‘the surprise package’ last season, because when we started with the qualifiers most people wouldn’t have predicted we’d go all the way to the final. But in our dressing room we don’t put any cap on our own expectations. This season there has been external discussion about whether we should prioritise certain comps over others. Whether there is more pressure to deliver in certain comps over others. Again, one place that discussion has not happened is at Melwood. There’s no need to prioritise so we don’t. We need to have the attitude in each and every game that the priority is to win. It’s that simple: just go out there and give everything you have to win. If you start thinking ‘we’d sooner win this, or that’ then you’ll end up failing. If you give yourself an excuse you’ll end up with nothing. We look for and take no excuses. Ever. Personally speaking, I like the pressure of thinking we have to deliver each and every time we take to the pitch on a matchday. There are no free swings when you play for Liverpool and nor should there be. No-one here wants to be the underdog or the outsider - all of our team want expectation always because it means you’re performing at the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool vs Bayern Munich]</b> If we had to choose, we’d choose both. We prioritise game by game, no matter what competition it is, so Tuesday night for us is the biggest game of the season. And then so on and so on. It’ll be like that until the end of the season, that’s how we approach every game. That’s what we need to do, it’s not about favouring one competition. I feel we have a good enough squad to be able to challenge in both competitions as best we can, and hopefully at the end of the season we see we’re champions of at least one, if not both.</p>

It’ll be difficult but we have experience in the Champions League. We can go there and hurt them.<br /><br />We’re disappointed not to score. But we kept a clean sheet and defended well. We had enough chances, especially in the first half. It’s not the worst result in the world. The performance level was good but we lacked that bit in the final third. They’re a good team, they’re going to keep the ball. At times we found it frustrating. We were a bit unlucky in front of goal</p>

        <td><b>[Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson considers Mohamed Salah to offer so much more]</b> I have to admit it made me smile to hear and read after the Southampton game that Mo Salah has ended his ‘drought’ when he scored our second goal. In fairness to the ‘Egyptian King’, he made a good point in the live post-match TV interview by pointing out how many games I’d had to wait for a goal. Even though the joke was at my expense I loved that he wasn’t having it and gave a little nibble back at the premise of the question.<br /><br />The goal was a landmark one for Mo because it took him to 50 in the Premier League for our club. I saw afterwards that he achieved it in fewer games than it took <b>[Fernando]</b> Torres, <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez and <b>[Robbie]</b> Fowler. That’s some list of players and the biggest tribute you can pay Mo is that he absolutely belongs in that company.<br /><br />Even though it was a significant goal for him personally, the best thing about Mo is that it would have been the result that mattered so much more to him on the evening. You could see that in his celebration. Like all of us, he knew what an important goal that was for the club and our ambition of winning the game and going back to the top of the table.<br /><br />I’m not naive enough to ignore the fact that for goalscorers and strikers the numbers do matter - in the same way our ‘keeper and defenders will take pride in clean sheets and Robbo and Trent do in assists this season. But if anyone on the outside thinks a single player in our dressing room is more interested in personal achievements over the team’s they are massively mistaken.<br /><br />During the period he hasn’t been scoring Mo has played some of his best football for Liverpool in my opinion and his contribution has been even bigger than last season. He’s evolved so much since he arrived here and brings so much to our play.<br /><br />You saw how we reacted as a team to his role in the winning goal against Spurs - and if I was on the Premier League panel I’d have definitely awarded it to him! But in a way, it said it all. Mo was delighted to have played a big part in us getting such an important win and we were all massively appreciative of what he did. He didn’t need to be credited with the goal for us, his teammates, to recognise his value.<br /><br />I think I’m right in saying he’s bagged 21 goals this season, which by the way is absolutely massive coming on the back of what he achieved last season. That’s 65 goals for us overall in almost two seasons - a genuinely staggering figure. Throw in the number of assists too and it tells you everything about what he brings to this team.<br /><br />But if you ask all the other lads they’ll tell you the same thing: what Mo gives us can’t just be measured in the goals he scores himself. It’s the same for the entire front three actually - neither Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> nor Bobby <b>[Firmino]</b> bagged against Southampton but both were absolutely outstanding from start to finish and made a massive difference.<br /><br />The three are the epitome of ‘team players’ - they work, they graft, they give everything to help the team win. And they’re all, obviously, world-class forwards.</td>
        <td><br /><br />I’ve no idea how many Mo will end up with when the season finishes, except to say I’m pretty confident it’ll be more than he has now - but, to be honest, it doesn’t matter. The number that matters to all of us is our position in the Premier League when 38 games are done and the end outcome in the Champions League. And for Mo, his aim is to get us as close to achieving our aims as possible, in any way he can.</td>

  <p><b>[Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has revealed that he requested the role change]</b> Me and the gaffer just had a conversation. Obviously he saw the England games. I felt good playing in that position. I felt more natural and it was something he said he would think about. I can do both positions and he sees I can do both. It’s basically what he wants and needs. I felt more comfortable and natural in that position for England, creating chances further up and doing what I enjoy doing. At the same time when I played No.6 I felt I’ve learned that position really well.<br /><br />I don’t think the manager had thought about it too much until I mentioned it to him … the manager might not have seen me in that position too much. It’s all about putting the team first, I know that, but at the same time I want to contribute as much as I can. I feel as though I can do that more in a position further forward.<br /><br />In the last couple of years there hasn’t really been a player like Fabinho in that role, so I’ve had to adapt to that role. I think I’ve done quite well. I think if you look at Fab, it’s quite natural to him, that’s his position and he’s so good at what you need to do in that position. I just thought that might give me a bit more license to get forward more. The manager wants me in both positions, which is good for me and for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson sees anticipation rather than desperation at Liverpool]</b> It feels like we’ve been talking about scenarios for the end of the season since August. I’ve honestly not known a season like it. Essentially, since the opening weeks of the campaign, there has been speculation and comment on what every result means for what can be achieved this season. How many wins will it take? How many points do you need? How many points do your opponents need to drop and where might that happen? Clearly, with just a handful of games to go, that talk has ramped up to a point where, on the outside, it feels like discussions about what might or might not happen are going on 24/7. But, as you’ll have heard nearly every player in our squad say repeatedly when asked, it isn’t something that has consumed us.<br /><br />We haven’t lost an ounce of focus. Don’t get me wrong; all of us are living and breathing every second of this. We absolutely love it and we are completely focused on it. We love the pressure, the intensity and the focus. This is what every single one of us wants every single season - to have these pressures at this point of the season. Someone told me that a supporter had said playing Champions League games that kick off in daylight is what Liverpool supporters want all the time because it means you’re playing these games at the end of April and May, which is the business end. We’ve done that two seasons running and how we’re handling this as a group of players is what gives me the hope for the years to come that we can be a force season after season.<br /><br />When I look around our dressing room I see a group of players who could be together for years and years if we all want that. The best way of describing our current situation is that the overriding feeling is opportunity and that goes for everyone connected with the club - from the dressing room to the terraces.<br /><br />It’s anticipation rather than desperation. We’re acting like a club that ‘belongs’ at this level but not in an arrogant way. I think that’s been a key part of our growth as a club and it’s why everyone should be relishing and embracing the pressure of the remaining weeks of the season.<br /><br />You’ll have seen James Milner’s celebration after scoring the penalty at Cardiff. He was taking the mickey out of himself for being the most senior player age-wise in the dressing room, but look at how Millie plays and how much energy he has. He can keep playing at this level for years and years, the way he looks after himself. I’ve only seen him get quicker, fitter and stronger during his time here - and again that says everything about our squad and the commitment from everyone in it.<br /><br />It’s difficult to talk about the long-term when you’re fighting for what we are in this moment, but I do think it’s relevant to the current mood of calm focus we have as an entire club. Our supporters are clearly loving every moment and, like with us players, I only see joy and belief in them at the moment. I don’t see anything other than us all living the moment and I think that’s a big part of our growth. The fear and desperation isn’t there anymore. No one here thinks we’ve cracked it, but the support we are getting shows total belief.<br /><br />There’s also patience. Collectively we know we don’t need to be 1-0 up after 10 minutes because we have the quality to score at any time. So, if we go in at half-time goalless, or fall behind in a game, we’re still fully convinced we can go on and win it. The supporters know every single player is giving all they have every time they take to the pitch. For most of the season giving our all has been enough to get the result we wanted. That’s why we’re in this really positive situation now.</p>

  <p><b>[Henderson highlights Liverpool progress without Luis Suarez &amp; Coutinho]</b> There’s no room for sentiment in football and particularly in contests that mean as much as this one, but it will be great to see Luis Suarez and Phil Coutinho back at Anfield. I have no idea if either will start the game or not, but they’ll be with our visitors and I’m sure for them the emotion of coming back here will be strong, especially as it’s the first time both of them will have played here against Liverpool since leaving the club.<br /><br />Luis and Phil are friends as well as ex-teammates. Personally speaking, I learned a lot from both when I was lucky enough to share a dressing room with them. Clearly both are very different personalities on the pitch, but both are winners and two of the best footballers on the planet. Off the pitch they are actually very similar. Family is everything to them and their partners and children are some of the best people you could ever wish to meet. But on the pitch they have something in common: both are world class.<br /><br />When a player decides they want to go and do something else I can understand why the supporters of the club that they’re leaving might feel a little disappointed, and as a team-mate I was disappointed when both left. But I think we can all respect that people have their own lives to live and their own decisions to make. Despite being good friends, I hope both are devastated when the game finishes because we are through and they are out. But beyond the game itself I really do hope Luis and Phil can take a moment to stop and appreciate being back at a club they did so much to help when they played here. In a funny way, seeing both back at Anfield tonight in Barca shirts sums up where we are as a club in this moment and the progress we are making. We face them as opponents in a Champions League semi-final. It proves that when players leave a club it’s critical that you build on their legacy and keep moving forward.<br /><br />This team and this club is moving in the right direction and we are now at a point where world-class players see this place as a destination. You arrive at this point thanks to the hard work and dedication of many different types of people. Luis and Phil played their part in that along with many others. Hopefully they’ll leave remembering why Anfield is so special, but not because they’ll leave with a Barca win. They’ll see a club that is back at Europe’s top table and one that hopefully has another big chapter to come in this season’s story.</p>

We knew that if we gave everything, you know never know what can happen in football. We said we would fight for everything right to the end. I think we proved quite a few people wrong tonight, We showed that if you never give up and you keep trying you can produce special things and create a special night<br /><br />I think he believed because of the talk he gave before the game before we came to the stadium. I think the players could see that the manager believed which helps us believe in what he said to us. He said we can enjoy the night and maybe tell the grandkids one day it was a special night. The manager has ingrained that belief into us - no matter what happens you keep fighting right until the end until the final whistle goes. That is what we have done all season and we will continue to do that on Sunday <b>[when Liverpool face Wolves in their final Premier League game]</b> and in the final as well. We have two big games to look forward to and we just have to keep with that belief and that spirit. Then we will be OK.<br /><br />I quite enjoy it now. I’ve got used to it! But is only a <b>[good]</b> display from me because of my team-mates. It is nothing to do with one person. Yes I contributed but so did everyone else who played. It was everybody together. For me throughout my career I have always wanted to prove people wrong and that will never change. I will continue to do that until I finish playing football. Football is like that anyway. It changes that quickly. Whether you are winning trophies or not there are always questions asked, someone else saying you cannot do this or that. So there are always things that you want to prove. I want to improve as a footballer and keep getting better to contribute to the team to be successful<br /><br />It was just an amazing night. I was honoured to be a part of it</p>

It was fantastic for a young player to have the awareness to be able to do that and put in the ball and obviously for Divock to react to that. It was a great finish in the end.

  <p><b>[England midfielder Jordan Henderson has backed his international team-mates to react in the ‘right way’ following the disappointing defeat to the Netherlands on Thursday night]</b> Mistakes will happen in football, it’s just how you deal with it and react. Everyone has made mistakes and big mistakes in football, that’s part of the game and part of the sport. I’m sure the lads who made mistakes the other night will react in the right way and they will be better for it in the long term. Now we want to concentrate on moving forward and I don’t think by any means the other night it was a terrible performance. We were a centimetre away from winning the game against a very good Holland side. I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom, we are by no means the finished article and there are a lot of things we can improve upon and get better at. We have a year to do that before the Euros. I am very positive for the future.</p>

We will never forget what happened in Madrid, but the focus has to be on the future<br /><br /><b>[<a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> in particular represents a potential game-changer]</b> He’s a fantastic person off the field. Last season he was a massive part behind the scenes even though he had a bad injury and I’m sure he was going through some painful times but he was always positive, always happy around the team and always there to support us when we needed him. He was a massive part off the field for us last season and this season hopefully he will be a massive part on the field as well. Hopefully he will show everyone what he is capable of like he did before he got injured. He has looked so strong, so good in training. This pre-season is important for him to get back to playing games regularly, get his match fitness back and once he does that I’m sure he will be flying again. He is like a new signing for us.

He gives us something different in that position, the way that he receives the ball, he can get out of tight situations, he can open the play up for us and start the play really well. I’m excited to see what he can bring us in that position. He is enjoying it, he is learning and improving. I’ve learned that position over the last few seasons as best I can so I will try to help him as well as <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>, who does that role fantastically well.

I can play as an 8, I can play as a 6. It is wherever I’m needed and wherever the manager wants me to play on a particular day. I’ve enjoyed when I’ve played that position a little higher up, but I enjoy both positions. I just want to contribute as much as I can and help the team as much as I can. I will do whatever the manager tells me to</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson wants <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to dream big in 2019-20]</b> In this league, the moment you’re complacent or arrogant you are done for. It’s why staying focused and staying hungry is critical and I’m confident as a dressing room we have those qualities. Someone showed me a Twitter exchange over the summer that actually captures the mentality we’re looking for, not just this coming season but in general. It was a poll by supporters asking to pick the club’s greatest ever European night at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. A Liverpool-supporting journalist replied ‘The. Next. One’. For us, that’s the focus for this season - on to the next one. But for us that mantra isn’t about just European nights or trophies and titles in general, it’s about each and every match we play<br /><br />As a team we want our supporters to dream and dream big. At Wembley <b>[in the Community Shield]</b> the passion and noise from the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans was magnificent. They showed the right mentality - when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play it always matters. They gave everything to make the atmosphere special and it made a difference to us and how we attacked the game. The supporters who went to Wembley helped set the tone. For each game, give everything you have. We want everyone to have the biggest ambitions possible. It’s our job to deliver and to do that we can’t afford distraction and we can’t afford to pause and feel satisfaction.<br /><br />What we achieved last season will be cherished by everyone connected to this club forever, not least myself. But now, for us as a group of players, we’re already focused on 2019-20. Quite simply we have to be if we want to have a chance of success again. What we can afford is to keep the focus on what’s ahead and what we can positively affect. The. Next. One</p>

Of course that’s a positive, but it’s important we look at the other side of that stat as well. Part of being ‘mentality monsters’ is that you challenge yourselves and always look at where you can be better. As a team, do we like the fact that our mindset is ‘keep going and never submit’? Yes, of course. But I would also like to think we’d look at those numbers and set ourselves the task of not putting ourselves in the position in the first place.<br /><br />Comebacks make for great television, but it’s on us as a squad to address the issue of falling behind in games. We want to be a side that dominates teams and takes total control of a game. We’ve proved time and time again we can do that, but clearly at the moment we haven’t been doing enough to make sure we are in a dominant position on the scoreboard for longer periods. There are many reasons you can find yourselves behind in a game and some of them are beyond your control. The opposition might be on fire and have a player who scores an absolute ‘worldie’. You can also get bad luck, by which I mean a bounce of a ball or a poor decision. But the truth is, the majority of the time a team goes behind is because they haven’t done the right things in that moment. And we as a team will look to address that.<br /><br />There isn’t a member of our squad who isn’t determined to improve every single day. Part of improvement is being able to identify the correct areas to work on and find a way to address it. That’s one of the most impressive things about this group of players: there is always a desire to improve and a desire to do better, even with the smallest of details. It’s nice to get the praise for the comebacks, but we’ll be far more satisfied when we get to the point that the comeback isn’t necessary</p>

  <p><b>[Henderson: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have suffered a lot of setbacks this season]</b> One of the best qualities of our squad in recent seasons has been the ability to respond positively to setbacks. It’s probably a misconception this season that we haven’t experienced many. I can tell you we have - all the time in fact.<br /><br />We’ve had setbacks and adversity within games and we’ve reacted in the right way. We’ve had setbacks and adversity with injuries and illness and we’ve reacted in the right way. We haven’t lost that many games as a club recently, but when those defeats have come we’ve reacted in the right way.<br /><br />I think the reason for that is quite simple: we don’t make anything bigger than it needs to be. We view every setback as a problem that has a solution. As a group, our culture is: find that solution. Losing in Madrid was disappointing, bitterly disappointing. But perspective is important and so is not over-inflating it. Truth is, the tie is only at half-time, so there’s a long way to go.<br /><br />As the manager said, we always remain calm at half-time during a 90-minute game and look at how we can positively impact the second half, so why wouldn’t we do that when we have three weeks to prepare for the return? And we’ll have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> behind us that night, too. But the other truth is that we need to draw a line immediately as that return leg isn’t until next month and we have lots of work and challenges before then. Our mantra has been, for a long time: focus on the next game and only the next game. That’s what we’ll do.<br /><br />And, by the way, it’s not hard to refocus because the task ahead of us tonight is really tough. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> are a team packed with international quality players, with a manager who is vastly experienced in getting positive results, and with a desire and hunger to improve their situation. If our focus is anywhere other than entirely on trying our best to win this game we’ll suffer another setback without a doubt</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain Jordan Henderson would welcome <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> back to Merseyside]</b> Phil is a good friend of mine. I think he is an exceptional footballer, he has everything, he has a great attitude and he loves football. So, of course, for me he would always be welcome, but it is not up to me. It is probably best to ask the manager that. The boys loved him, so if you ask any of them, I’m sure they’ll say they would love to have him back. But I think his time here has passed, he has moved and I hope that in the near future we will see the same Phil we saw here</p>

I feel as though that’s something the manager really started to instil in the squad when he first came. When he first came, I can remember him talking about never ever stopping and finishing or changing your mentality within a game. You always finish, you always keep going no matter what happens within a game, no matter what score it is, right until the very end, because you never know what can happen in football and you need to keep the same mentality and keep going right until the end. I can always remember that right from the very beginning<br /><br />If I look back through the time he’s been here and you look at games like <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in the Europa League, coming back like we did in that game, and little games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> people might not really pick up on, but when you go back I think it has been a progression over a few years and not just one season. I think this season has been massive in terms of the consistency of it, but I really feel as though that was a work in progress and it’s now part of our identity really, that no matter what happens within the game we never stop and we never change the mentality until the game’s finished</p>

So if you look back there were a few moments where we’ve been through those tough times together. We always responded in the right way and we always kept going and kept improving so I knew after the last game of the league, I knew it would in some way help us going into the final to make sure it wasn’t going to happen again. Certainly the Madrid game, you learn a lot from playing in finals and especially a Champions League one. I felt we learnt a lot from that Madrid game<br /><br />It was just something that happened. Would I have preferred the cameras not to be there? Probably so you couldn’t see us crying! But at the same time I think that’s what football is all about, the emotion, the passion that I have for football, that my dad’s had over the years, what he’s gone through for me to get me where I am.

  <p><b>[Henderson confident <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will hit ground running on return from coronavirus lockdown]</b> You need to keep the fitness levels as high as you can, and we were given a programme from the club to do, which was really helpful for us to try to keep some sort of general fitness up so when we do come back in we’re at a good enough level to start doing the twisting and turning, the longer passing back into it. That’s been really good for us and I think a lot of the lads will be at a decent level of fitness so when the time does come where we need to play games, I am sure we will be ready.<br /><br />It’s been a long time, or at least it’s felt like a long time <b>[not playing]</b>. Obviously it was a little bit difficult not knowing when you’re going to go back, so you need to tailor it as best you can, which the fitness staff have done unbelievably well for us. We’re in a good enough position now to start getting going again, getting the balls out and introducing longer passing and getting the sharpness back, which hopefully won’t take too long and we’ll be right back at it again<br /><br />You do reflect a lot more and look back at things, especially with the time we’ve been sort of off. I haven’t so much looked forward, I’ve actually looked back a little bit more in terms of the season and actually what we’ve achieved so far is incredible really, as a team. It’s more about using that as motivation within training to keep going, because when the time comes we want to make sure we’re in the best shape we possibly can be to finish off as good as we have been for all season really. We want to make sure that when the time is right and we do start playing games again, we pick up where we left off and continue to perform at the highest level, which, looking back, has been incredible for a long period of time</p>
