  <p><b>[Timo Werner cemented his status as hometown hero, leading Stuttgart’s charge for a return to the Bundesliga after suffering relegation. But then RB Leipzig came calling]</b> I am VfB through and through but I hope the fans will understand that I want to take this opportunity <b>[at Leipzig]</b>; I have to think about my career.<br /><br />Keeping hold of him will be paramount to their success, particularly with the likes of Bayern and Liverpool said to be sniffing around. If you were to play at Anfield and hear the fans sing ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone,’ it would certainly be something special.<br /><br /><b>[But Liverpool, and everyone else, will likely have to wait]</b> I feel at home here at RB right now. Leipzig can continue to grow, and if I could be part of it I’d be delighted</p>

It would be a lie if I said that I would not care. But I don’t think about Real Madrid or another big club at the moment, but only about RB Leipzig.<br /><br />Of course I want to play at a big club. But we have not yet come to terms with the development in Leipzig. Perhaps RB will be a big club too - I’m quite sure.<br /><br />In Spain, there are a maximum of three clubs with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. In England, there are a bit more: Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City. Bayern Munich is also a big club, but for me it is not a topic that I am concerned with.<br /><br />Of course, I look at the offer <b>[of a new contract]</b>. If I do not extend now, that does not mean that I switch <b>[clubs]</b> in the summer. On the other hand, it is often not the case that players stay for five years if the contract is still five years. Football is so fast, you never know where you are tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner has offered transfer hope to the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester City]</b> If you take Germany, it would be a lie to say that you would not like to play for Bayern. It would be a lie to say in England you’d not like to play for Manchester United or Manchester City. Spain - Barca or Real. There are great clubs in every league. Italy or France would not be my leagues, but the other three. There are so many clubs you’d like to play for. I don’t want to tie myself down. I’ll see what happens.<br /><br />The new season is still far away. We have big goals with RB, want to qualify for Champions League. Hopefully, I’ll go the World Cup after that, and only then I will think about the future. Right now, I feel good here at Leipzig. My contract says that I should, must, can, will play here for another two years. That’s why there are no other thoughts</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner has admitted that he hopes to play in the Premier League in the near future]</b> Playing in the Premier League is a dream for me. I would like to play for two or three clubs, and Manchester United are one of those clubs. But probably not in the next few years - later, when my English is a little bit better! I’m very comfortable at RB Leipzig, though. Manchester United and Liverpool were the teams I watched quite a lot in England. They were the two that I’m a little bit a fan of, because they have so much history. When Alex Ferguson was the coach, United won everything and were outstanding. In Liverpool it’s also their stadium and the atmosphere. But, when I have to decide, I’m more Manchester United than Liverpool. I’m now at a point where at some stage in the future I’d like to play in a team that wins titles</p>

It’s a pleasure but I know <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have a lot of good players and I have to improve myself, to learn much more things to get on this level to play there<br /><br /><b>[Werner does not know why <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> did not decide to make a move for him in 2019]</b> I can’t answer what motivated <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> back then. I am happy and satisfied that I extended my contract here and played in Leipzig this season. In my eyes I have developed further under <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a> and have matured as a personality and taken on more responsibility. I am totally grateful for that. I really appreciate what I have at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> and would therefore never say: ‘I have to get out of here!<br /><br /><a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are a great club, we don’t need to talk about it, and <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> has proven this season he is a really good head coach. But if a move were to become an issue at some point, I would be more tempted by a move abroad than a move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. It’s just that the challenge of another league would appeal to me a little more than a move within the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Of course, it also important that mutual respect is there as much as possible. That’s why I chose <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> at the time, and why I would choose the club for <b>[the]</b> next step as one where I would get that feeling.</p>

  <p><b>[Leipzig had little difficulty sweeping Mainz aside and were 3-0 up by half-time]</b> We played very well from the first minute and put pressure on the whole game. We absolutely wanted to secure the important three points for the qualification for the Champions League next season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> signing Timo Werner has revealed his decision to abandon <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>’s Champions League campaign ‘hurt’, as he prepares to officially head to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> Of course it hurts me that I can’t help out <b>[<a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>]</b> to play in the Champions League. But I’m a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea FC</a> player from July 1st and I’m being paid by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> from then on. It was clear that all parties - <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, RB and my side - should and must settle this. Of course I tried to keep out of the Champions League issue as much as I could because it was clear that I would have to hurt one side. That’s why my agent finally agreed it with the clubs<br /><br />I am forever connected to Leipzig and RB, will sit in front of the TV during the quarter finals and keep my fingers crossed - maybe I can even be on site in Lisbon</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner has revealed that he elected to sign for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this summer from <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> because of the impression that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> made on him]</b> The discussions with the board at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were so good that I ultimately chose them. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> in particular stood behind me and really wanted me to know that if I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I could feel just as comfortable as I do with Leipzig.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> reportedly badgered Werner to sign with his team and used former goalkeeper <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> as an interpreter]</b> In the conversations with me, the coach often emphasised how much he wanted me, how much he valued me as a person. Of course it’s hard to give up an oasis of wellbeing like the one I’ve had in Leipzig for years, but you can only get ahead in a career if you take the next step. This season was the crossroads, otherwise I would always have stayed with Leipzig. I’ve decided on something new and I hope that my form will continue like this</p>

<p><br /><br />I’ve been received in Leipzig like never before in my career. No matter which coach was in charge, I always had supporters here. Now there is Julian, who is again a giant and is someone who has made me significantly better</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea-bound Timo Werner admits to ‘several offers’ after links to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; Inter]</b> I agreed a few weeks ago. The whole thing was quite unproblematic because I had a lot of time to think about it before the corona <b>[virus]</b> period. It’s no secret that there were several offers<br /><br />There were some top clubs that fought for me. The entire Chelsea-London package was the best for me, my game and my career. The game is played more often in England than in Germany, so there is not much time left for training. But it’s true, I still have to prove myself and go full throttle</p>
