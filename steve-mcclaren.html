You saw when we were down to 10 men, we had great attitude and character and it said we’re ready for the new season. You could tell they had played competitive games this season, they looked a little bit sharper than us</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> What an unbelievable career he’s had, both on and off the field. I’ve been fortunate to work with some great players and he was one of them. He was a great player. He made the very most of his talents through sheer hard work, professionalism and always doing extra on the training field. He inspired his team-mates through his performances and he was a winner; he has won so many things through his career and that was infectious on his team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> He was very competitive and occasionally he went over the mark, but that’s what winners do. He developed, he matured as he went along and he adapted his game, which you have to do playing for 20 years at the top level. He was a specialist in the right midfield position, an unbelievable passer, crosser and could score a range of goals as well. He was an inspiring personality to young players with his behaviour and his professionalism on and off the field. But ultimately he was a leader</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren pays tribute to <a href="ugo-ehiogu.html">Ehiogu</a>, his former player he coached at Middlesbrough]</b> I’m devastated for Ugo’s family. What a sad loss he will be to football. Ugo was a real leader and was going to be a very good coach. I only saw him a couple of months ago at a course at St George’s Park, looking fit and healthy, as always. I will remember Ugo as a real warrior on the field, but a gentle giant off it</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is likely to stay at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite the incessant talk of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> I think he will stay, he would have gone by now. They would have replaced him and now they don’t need to, that’s the key thing. You could see it on Sunday, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> did really well against him in the first half, but once he got space in the second half, he can deliver the pass, score the goal. He can do things. When Ole first came in, he got the best out of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> for the first 15 games and the way he turned the game around against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, that’s what he’s capable of doing. Ole believes he can get the best out of him and especially with <b>[Harry]</b> Maguire and the way they have started, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might think ‘yeah, I could be the king of this team’. These players want top players around them, to be challenging for the trophies. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> demonstrated that with the summer signings <b>[and]</b> the first game. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might be thinking ‘they really want me and this is a good team, I could win things here’<br /><br /><b>[Maguire was the marquee addition at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> window]</b> <b>[They have]</b> signed <b>[Aaron]</b> <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> and the young boy from <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> <b>[Daniel]</b> James. But the biggest of the summer was Maguire. He’s like <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> signing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the difference - the person that took <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the next level. I think Maguire can do exactly the same for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He did it on Sunday against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he was magnificent. He’s a great defender, a leader. The way he speaks to the players and his demeanour, confidence and courage when he has the ball, I think he’s the perfect signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is the only <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player who would force his way into <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s 1999 treble-winning side]</b> <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> next to <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a>, that would be invincible. Nobody would get past them. But for me, seriously, only Van Dijk would get into that team. When you look at that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team, that is leadership throughout the whole team, and leadership was the key. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are developing that now</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> can’t use <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> as lone frontman]</b> I think this is where he’s been struggling in this midfield and its blend and balance. It’s square pegs in square holes, round pegs in round holes. At the moment <b>[Andreas]</b> Pereira, who I’ve seen play as a No 10, is he a holder? <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> is getting better, more confident, but he likes to roam around. They’ve got nobody like a <b>[Roy]</b> Keane sat in there. Absolutely <b>[<a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>]</b> could do that but he still goes and wanders, but at least he’s got the physicality to get around. So they’re missing somebody in there.<br /><br />They’ve signed <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes who they think is their No 10. A key role when you’re playing that kind of system. <b>[Juan]</b> Mata, great player. Best position? Don’t know, don’t know. Winger? No. James is still a young player finding his legs and the key one is Martial. Martial is not a No 9, he is not a striker. All his goals, all his best moments are on that left-hand side. Whether that’s outside left or whether that’s inside left, that’s where he plays. He cannot play down the middle on his own<br /><br />The first job is to get them characters of leadership, or people who can become leaders, back in at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, back on that training ground. Because the inconsistency is an inconsistency of training day to day, Monday to Friday, where you need leaders continuously, continuously setting standards. When I look at that back four, <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, <b>[<a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>]</b> tremendous signing, <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a> getting better, <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> perfect, <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a>, and the young boy Brandon Williams behind him is also a very, very good player. So the back five nice and solid and strong, what a base. You start from that, great base</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren turns down opportunity to take charge at Dundee United]</b> Tony Asghar and I had a great meeting regarding the manager’s job at Dundee United. I am very impressed with the clubs structure, philosophy and ambition and I’m sure they will be very successful. I have a great desire to be managing and coaching again and it is disappointing that this chance comes at the wrong time for me. I wish Tony and the board the best of luck in bringing the club and its fans the success they deserve.</p>
