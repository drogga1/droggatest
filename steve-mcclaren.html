  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> What an unbelievable career he’s had, both on and off the field. I’ve been fortunate to work with some great players and he was one of them. He was a great player. He made the very most of his talents through sheer hard work, professionalism and always doing extra on the training field. He inspired his team-mates through his performances and he was a winner; he has won so many things through his career and that was infectious on his team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> He was very competitive and occasionally he went over the mark, but that’s what winners do. He developed, he matured as he went along and he adapted his game, which you have to do playing for 20 years at the top level. He was a specialist in the right midfield position, an unbelievable passer, crosser and could score a range of goals as well. He was an inspiring personality to young players with his behaviour and his professionalism on and off the field. But ultimately he was a leader</p>

What a sad loss he will be to football. Ugo was a real leader and was going to be a very good coach. I only saw him a couple of months ago at a course at St George’s Park, looking fit and healthy, as always. I will remember Ugo as a real warrior on the field, but a gentle giant off it</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba tension at Manchester United should be considered normal]</b> If you’re a football manager, every day you deal with tension in the dressing room. Every day you deal with at least 11 unhappy players who haven’t played on the Saturday, three players who have been brought off are unhappy, three players going on are unhappy because they should have gone on earlier. It’s the life of a football manager that players are going to be unsettled, unhappy if they’re not playing well. That’s the situation at Manchester United with Pogba. He’s the same as any other player and Mourinho has come out very strongly in a statement that’s really said ‘I’m in control’ and it’s about controlling players, not about keeping them happy. Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> once said to me: ‘Steve, players are here to make us happy and pleased, not us to make them happy and pleased. They’re here for us’.<br /><br />What Mourinho has is a disappointed, unhappy player because he is not playing well. Before he got injured, he was the best Manchester United player and he’s struggling after injury to get back to that form. That is all and this is normal, you ask any manager in any football club. They will have players who are exactly the same. It’s only highlighted because it’s Pogba and everybody assumes behind the scenes that there is tension and friction between the two. Of course there is, there always is with top players</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne is everything that Paul Pogba should be]</b> <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne looks like he has gone away to Germany for three or four years, come back and matured. He is consistent and is becoming a top player and a complete midfield player. Pogba looks like he has come back after leaving Manchester United and has not matured, he is inconsistent but I think <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho is the perfect manager to make him consistent and mature. With top players you need patience, but he <b>[Mourinho]</b> needs to drive him <b>[Pogba]</b> and discipline him. Everything that De Bruyne is, that is what he should be. For Pogba, leaving Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson has not done him any good. Coming back to that environment should improve him..<br /><br />It is not about age, it is about experience. De Bruyne is mature now but he still looks young. Pogba hasn’t got that maturity in his game. Mourinho is trying to get that back and he is trying to get discipline and hard work. De Bruyne is a great player but he is also plays for the team and works hard, tackles, win his duels, creates and scores</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren considers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be doing an unbelievable job at Manchester United]</b> Unbelievable. I think everyone was astonished at the appointment. It’s proven an unbelievable move. I know Ole well. He is a thinker. He is intelligent. He is very good at communicating with players and I think that has helped. He has gone into a situation, which many people said he had nothing to lose - he had everything to lose. No pressure? Enormous pressure! It is one of the top three clubs in the world. So that is pressure to manage them. And I know pressure also in yourself that you want to do well so I know Ole’s ambitions going in there and I think he has excelled <b>[above]</b> all expectations. Not just excelled but playing exciting, attacking Manchester United old traditional football.<br /><br />It looks like he will keep winning. People must look inside and what he is doing with the players and the job he is doing. I have got to say he has got tremendous staff around him. I know Mike Phelan, who must be a great help. Staff are also very important and the staff have rallied around. The players have bought in very, very quickly. They have adapted to what he is trying to give them and it is working. If it continues to work I think Manchester United will have an easy decision at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is likely to stay at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite the incessant talk of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> I think he will stay, he would have gone by now. They would have replaced him and now they don’t need to, that’s the key thing. You could see it on Sunday, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> did really well against him in the first half, but once he got space in the second half, he can deliver the pass, score the goal. He can do things. When Ole first came in, he got the best out of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> for the first 15 games and the way he turned the game around against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, that’s what he’s capable of doing. Ole believes he can get the best out of him and especially with <b>[Harry]</b> Maguire and the way they have started, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might think ‘yeah, I could be the king of this team’. These players want top players around them, to be challenging for the trophies. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> demonstrated that with the summer signings <b>[and]</b> the first game. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might be thinking ‘they really want me and this is a good team, I could win things here’<br /><br /><b>[Maguire was the marquee addition at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> window]</b> <b>[They have]</b> signed <b>[Aaron]</b> <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> and the young boy from <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> <b>[Daniel]</b> James. But the biggest of the summer was Maguire. He’s like <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> signing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the difference - the person that took <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the next level. I think Maguire can do exactly the same for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He did it on Sunday against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he was magnificent. He’s a great defender, a leader. The way he speaks to the players and his demeanour, confidence and courage when he has the ball, I think he’s the perfect signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McClaren says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> can’t use <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> as lone frontman]</b> I think this is where he’s been struggling in this midfield and its blend and balance. It’s square pegs in square holes, round pegs in round holes. At the moment <b>[Andreas]</b> Pereira, who I’ve seen play as a No 10, is he a holder? <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> is getting better, more confident, but he likes to roam around. They’ve got nobody like a <b>[Roy]</b> Keane sat in there. Absolutely <b>[<a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>]</b> could do that but he still goes and wanders, but at least he’s got the physicality to get around. So they’re missing somebody in there.<br /><br />They’ve signed <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes who they think is their No 10. A key role when you’re playing that kind of system. <b>[Juan]</b> Mata, great player. Best position? Don’t know, don’t know. Winger? No. James is still a young player finding his legs and the key one is Martial. Martial is not a No 9, he is not a striker. All his goals, all his best moments are on that left-hand side. Whether that’s outside left or whether that’s inside left, that’s where he plays. He cannot play down the middle on his own<br /><br />The first job is to get them characters of leadership, or people who can become leaders, back in at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, back on that training ground. Because the inconsistency is an inconsistency of training day to day, Monday to Friday, where you need leaders continuously, continuously setting standards. When I look at that back four, <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, <b>[<a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>]</b> tremendous signing, <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a> getting better, <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> perfect, <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a>, and the young boy Brandon Williams behind him is also a very, very good player. So the back five nice and solid and strong, what a base. You start from that, great base</p>

I am very impressed with the clubs structure, philosophy and ambition and I’m sure they will be very successful. I have a great desire to be managing and coaching again and it is disappointing that this chance comes at the wrong time for me. I wish Tony and the board the best of luck in bringing the club and its fans the success they deserve.</p>
