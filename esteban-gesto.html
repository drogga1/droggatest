<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Inside Tabarez’s youth system that ensures tiny Uruguay will keep punching above their weight]</b> He has practically made the national team like a club, where respect is the most important factor. He has developed generations of players via the Under-20, U17 and U15 teams. The people involved, the players and of all the members of the technical staff, are respectful and educated, individually and socially. Oscar has managed to forge a great level of co-operation between all of the players and all of the squads that are under his command.<br /><br />He’s managed to make the senior players go directly from the airport to training. There is a feeling of professional responsibility, of discipline, in every one of the players and he has managed to make them feel they really belong in the team, and their pride at playing for the national team is clear if you see how they work<br /><br />Via the results that he has achieved, he has convinced the directors of the association. In Latin America it has always been very difficult to kick-start any project that requires economic outlay, but he has managed to convince them that it is an investment, not an outlay. He has the support of who he needs to support him, and that is to his credit, because it is not easy in South America to convince directors that it is worth the effort to try something like this, that it’s worth the effort to invest money in the sporting side of the game<br /><br />He has managed to improve the work of all the youth teams, the selection process, and earned the respect of the clubs in the delivery of the youth players from Monday to Wednesday, which was not easy many years ago. And importantly he has improved the infrastructure and logistics where the Uruguay national team works, he has worked to get excellent training pitches, a covered, synthetic pitch that is vital during the winter. Generally he has improved and categorised the processes of developing players in the youth teams - U20, U17 and U15 - and he has created, we say here, a natural process of growth and personal and professional development of the lads who are involved. The youth teams are always active in some way; now for example they are preparing for the U20 South American championship in 2019. They have travelled to China and the Odesur games in Bolivia. It’s a process that allows the players to graduate to the first team naturally. As a result of this long process he really knows the players, he knows what they can give, and in the last few years he has managed to refresh the senior team - most noticeably in midfield - with players who have characteristics that suit the modern game<br /><br />Argentina have many millions more people than us and of course they have a huge amount of values. Argentina were many times U20 world champions and they also produce a huge amount of players, the same as Brazil. We are much smaller, we have smaller possibilities in terms of the number of players. What happens here is that we dream about football, we live football, and despite the small population of our country there is such a high percentage of people who play football. I think that Argentina will implement a new process, they have very capable people, a huge amount of qualified coaches, like Mr Bielsa among others, like <b>[Mario]</b> Zanabria. I think they will start a process taking into account what has happened in Uruguay and what has happened in Argentina at this moment in time<br /><br />Tabarez has united the Uruguayan people behind their national team, so much so that children and the new generations venerate and love their national team and its players. It is a truly difficult process in today’s football, where only winning matters. He has done this through the honest effort and respect that radiates from his work and the behaviour of his players; those who were here before, those who are there now, and those who will come in the future</p>
