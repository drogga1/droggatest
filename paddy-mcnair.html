  <p><b>[Manchester United teenager Paddy McNair says that receiving his first call-up to the Northern Ireland squad is a lifetime ambition fulfilled]</b> When I was growing up, I always aimed to play for my country. Obviously, as I’ve been playing for United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, I did hope I would receive the call. I’m really happy to get called up. I could have been involved last month for the Faroe Islands and Greece games so it’s great I’ve been recalled to join the squad for Romania. I want to keep working hard and try to play as many games as I can for United. Hopefully, I can break into the Northern Ireland team when I go. I do know a few of the lads - Corry Evans and Luke McCullough from United, of course. I know some others from the Under-21s so I am looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Paddy McNair has revealed that he defied the wishes of Jose Mourinho in order to force through a move away from Manchester United]</b> He wanted me to go on loan and I went in to see Jose and just said ‘look, if you don’t let me go on a permanent, I’m just going to stay here’. That’s how strongly I thought about it. At the time, it’s what I wanted so I’ve got no regrets. I think he quite liked how I was straight up. I said I wanted to leave, that I didn’t want to go on loan. I think he respected that. I told him that I’d been here since I was 12-years-old and club could at least let me do what I want to do. I spoke to Ed Woodward and said the same to him. I was refusing to go on loan basically. I just wanted a new challenge and off I went.</p>
