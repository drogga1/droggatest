  <p><b>[West Ham midfielder Mark Noble clashed with a pitch invader as their 3-0 defeat to Burnley]</b> We want the supporters behind us and since I’ve been here they’ve been really good, the supporters. But you can’t cross the line and come on the pitch. You know, the players had gone a goal down, we want them to keep their focus. What was going through my mind? Hopefully they wouldn’t stop the game. It’s a tough situation, I can sympathise with the fans. They just want to see their team win. It’s tough for them at the moment but they need to stick with the players. You don’t want that to happen on the pitch, it creates problems and safety issues. We were fine, they were just voicing their frustration</p>

  <p><b>[Burnley striker Chris Wood says his side do not fear Manchester City]</b> There’s never a free hit in these games. There’s always a chance, it’s the cup, they’ll make changes, we’ll make a few changes but we’ll go out there to win the game. We know they’re a quality side and they can do that to anybody. They can do it to a Premier League side, score six or seven past them. It doesn’t matter that they’ve scored so many goals, we’ve just got to try and nullify their strengths and capitalise on their weaknesses.<br /><br />You have to relish these games. These are the ties you want to play in. They’re the best games in the world and they’re what you dream of as a kid. You have to relish them, enjoy them and have fun. We’ll see where that gets us. It’s always good and you always want to keep the dream going. A few of the boys have been to the final but never won it. Hopefully one day a few of us boys can get there with this team, which would be lovely</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> hero Chris <a href="neil-wood.html">Wood</a> feels <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> no longer have a fortress]</b> Look I don’t think <b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> is intimidating]</b>. I think the last couple of years we have come here and been up 2-0 both times and thrown it away. Today we have come here with the same mentality of working hard, getting in front, holding what’ve got and fighting hard - that’s what we’ve done.<br /><br />We had to grind it out, dog it out at times - but that’s what we are good at. Lucky we got the two goals which gave us a bit of comfort. It was a great defensive performance. <b>[My goal was]</b> what we work on - set pieces - we’re very strong at it. <b>[Ben Mee]</b> did well at the back post and lucky I was there to tap it in</p>
