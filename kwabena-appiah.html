  <p>[Central Coast Mariners winger Kwabena Appiah has conceded he did lose a bit of faith before finally breaking his A-League goal drought] I’ve got to be honest. I kind of did lose a bit of faith here and there but I guess perseverance paid off.<br /><br />I started to think if I was cursed, I was going to start going to - I don’t know - a psychiatrist to see if there was something wrong with me. I just couldn’t believe that I’d scored and I’m happy to have got the monkey off my back<br /><br />I’ve always had something for this club [the Mariners]. When I left after the youth team, I still kept in touch with the boys here that were here, and even the staff here as well<br /><br />If we get three points this weekend against Western Sydney Wanderers … we’ll only be two points off and that’s when we can start thinking, you know, we can really make something happen</p>

  <p>[Central Coast Mariners will keep chasing an A-League finals berth as long as it’s a mathematical possibility] It’s hard to take this loss but there’s still five games to go, five games to get three points in every single game. We still own that top six spot.<br /><br />That’s our playing style. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We’ve got to keep our playing style, otherwise if we don’t believe in what we’re doing then there’s no reason to be on the park. It’s a fantastic playing style. I love it and the boys love it and we’re going to keep doing it</p>
