  <p><b>[Andreas Pereira maintains that he wants to prove his worth at Manchester United]</b> Valencia approached my agent and said they want to buy me which is flattering, but it wasn’t like it was reported in the media. People said I’d demanded talks with Jose Mourinho when I’ve demanded nothing. The Valencia coach speaks with me a lot and we have a good understanding, but as far as I’m concerned I’m still a Manchester United player, with a contract at Old Trafford until 2020 and an ambition to make it at United. I’ve never sought to leave United</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Pereira reveals how he’s been helping Fred settle at Man Utd]</b> He’s from the same country so I help him. I try to do my best to help him and all of his family that have arrived. I’ve tried to help him feel at home so he can play better and better and he feels comfortable. He’s a very good guy. He’s settling in very well - he’s trying to speak English, he’s trying to adapt to his team-mates, so he’s doing very well.<br /><br />I can say I’m happy with pre-season. It was good for me to play a lot of minutes, so I’m sure I’m fit and it shows that I can play 90 minutes<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho has been using Pereira in a deep-lying role of late]</b> I’m still learning every day so it’s very important for me. It’s difficult as well to adapt, but I’m learning. I feel comfortable in this position, I’m feeling good and confident, so I’m trying to learn every day more and more, and to keep doing my best. It involves a lot of discipline. You have to play simple and make sure the players in front of you play. It’s playing simple, not taking a lot of risks and always look where you can help your team-mates</p>

I just want to make sure I can do the most for the team and help us win. Hopefully, I can do more and more in every game. I think it was a very good performance from the players. Winning 3-0 in the first away game, I think is very good, it gives confidence for the team and we have to kick on now.<br /><br />Yeah, it is my old team, I was there last season. Hopefully we can win those games against them as it would be good for our Champions League chances. I still speak to some friends that I have there and they will be good games<br /><br />Yeah, we are confident of getting a fourth win in a row. We have to keep winning and show that we are the best</p>

It was my dream, and it’s still my dream, and it’s nice to see others doing it.

I didn’t know him at the time but I speak Dutch so he asked me what the club was like. He had offers from other clubs but I told him, ‘You should come here, it’s the best club in the world. Don’t even think about it. If you come here and if you work hard, you will get a chance in the first team.’ Then he came, and to this day he remembers my advice<br /><br />The first day I arrived, I met all the players and I was very nervous. I couldn’t believe it when I was in the training gear and I looked down and I saw the badge on. I thought, ‘I’m at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I need to pinch myself.’ Then I said, ‘Now I need to work hard because I want to play in the first team and I want to get there’. I remember the first training session, we played rugby!
