<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Roa regrets spurning <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> because he thought the world was going to end]</b> At that time I was very attached to religion and bible study. It was a difficult decision to make but at the same time thoughtful – and my family agreed with me.<br /><br />Certain things happened that will never be known because they are personal and I could only speak to the most intimate people. Many things were said back then out of ignorance and I was branded a thousand bad things. The people of the club thought that I was going to go back and that they would recover a lot of money with that transfer that was about to happen.<br /><br />Today, I still think that on a ­spiritual level it was a very good decision. But in sporting terms it wasn’t – because I left football at the best moment of my career. I could have progressed a lot, with great contracts and the ­possibility of playing in England.<br /><br />People will never understand it. Back then they drove me crazy, they called me from all sides, and as much as I tried to explain my decision it was very difficult for them to understand.</p>
