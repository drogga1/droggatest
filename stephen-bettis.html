  <p><b>[Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder has signed a new three-year deal ahead of his side’s Premier League return]</b> Chris signing a new contract underpins everything we are attempting to do at Bramall Lane. He’s been the catalyst for our success over the past few years, he is a driven individual and his focus since promotion was secured has been preparing the club for the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United manager <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> and staff agree to pay deferral]</b> There is a long uncertain road ahead, but we remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure the stability of this great Football Club. I’d like to thank Chris and the senior coaching staff for being united in joining me in these short-term remuneration deferrals</p>

  <p><b>[Carla Ward: <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> Women part company with manager]</b> On behalf of the owner, board and everyone at the club, I’d like to place on record our thanks to Carla Ward for the four years of service. Carla was instrumental in the club achieving FA Championship status in 2018 and also in the women’s team reaching their highest ever position in the pyramid before the 2019-20 season was curtailed. However, both parties have opted to go down a different path. We will announce a new head coach in due course to be ready for the start of the 2020-21 campaign</p>
