<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Neymar has grown since joining PSG]</b> Last season, he grew, truly. Now he’s playing more in the centre, I think that every time he’s getting better.<br /><br />He’s matured a lot, primarily. Before, he’d primarily be a dribbler, trying to beat players with great skills. He was already scoring a lot, but tactically he didn’t always think what was to be done correctly<br /><br /><b>[Neymar was the subject to criticism during the World Cup]</b> I didn’t manage to speak to him after the World Cup, but you have to remember he went three months without playing. To come back from injury and go right into a World Cup isn’t easy. You lack confidence, you’re afraid of getting hurt. But the good thing is that he’s recovered from it and today is excellent<br /><br />I might text him and suggest that he stays at home and rests - there’s a Champions League game next week! Let him rest, relax at home and think of the Champions League!</p>
