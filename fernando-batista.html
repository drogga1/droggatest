  <p><b>[<a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> has also been backed to succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>]</b> It would be a great concern for rival defenders. Then, of course, there is the idea of ​​the coach. If you want to play 4-3-3, there would be room only for one of the two, but with those two beasts up top, he would have a great advantage. This would also give <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> more options to pass, who now comes a little further back. I would not hesitate: I would play with Suarez and Lautaro together. Those who play well and are smart can do it. So Suarez and Lautaro could play together without problems. An example is found today at Inter. Lautaro coexists with <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> without problems. They have similar characteristics and both stand out. When one goes through the middle, the other goes out to the band. They do not overlap</p>

  <p><b>[Batista went on to express his belief that Lautaro would have no trouble making the transition from Italy to Spain]</b> It will cost him less effort to establish himself in Spanish football than in Italian football. The defences in Italy are more aggressive, they don’t let you score as much, they do not give up as much space. The Spanish defender gives you two or three seconds of advantage. In Italy, you have to be a very good striker to do what Lautaro has done. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> does not score goals at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> as easily as at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It is because they mark players differently. A striker like Lautaro can easily adapt to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and also to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.<br /><br />Lautaro is on a path very similar to that of Batistuta. In having your head up, in speed, in heading, in physical power, they are very similar. Lautaro has many things similar to Bati, but he is more technical. With the ball, he is better</p>
