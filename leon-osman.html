  <p><b>[Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman was not surprised at Fellaini’s clumsiness]</b> He’s always been like that. If you came up against him in training he was always likely to stand on your toes or give you a dead leg. When he played for us we always wanted him as far away from our box as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku could prove to be the difference-maker in Manchester United’s Premier League title quest]</b> It’s an incredibly big price tag but you’ve got a player who could turn those draws into wins for Manchester United. That could potentially be a championship for them. He’ll bring goalscoring. It’s as simple as that, an ability to find the back of the net. Barring Ibrahimovic, that was Manchester United’s big falling down last season. That’s Lukaku’s forte. He’s been criticised for only doing it in the games against lesser clubs. They’re the games in which United struggled at home last season so it should be a good fit.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman believes David Moyes would be an ideal candidate to replace Ronald Koeman at Goodison Park]</b> I think Moyes would be able to do a good job immediately - he knows the club inside and out. Whether he would be a long-term candidate, I don’t know what the chairman is looking at. Is he looking at immediate results or someone who has a real pedigree of winning trophies? Or are they looking at someone like David Unsworth from the academy, who really knows the club and can bring the young lads through and inspire an Everton core? It’s really interesting to see what <b>[club owners]</b> Farhad Moshiri and Bill Kenwright are thinking right now.<br /><br />There’s a reason why things haven’t quite gone well but Everton will be a really good club for someone to take over. They have some fantastic players, a real set-up behind them and good money invested in the club. Okay, you might need a transfer window to get in a few bodies that a new manager would like, but Everton are a really desirable club that people will be after</p>

  <p><b>[Marouane Fellaini was effective for Manchester United]</b> I would say he was more accustomed to a Jose Mourinho style of football <b>[than Solskjaer’s]</b>. He’s physical, strong, effective at both ends, whereas Manchester United require a much more technically gifted player than, unfortunately, Fellaini’s capable of. Effective, that’s the word, for his time at Manchester United, but you can understand why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feels him surplus to requirements and I think for all parties it would be best if he found himself elsewhere. He’s a nice feller. He took a while to learn the language but a really nice feller, desperate to get involved in the dressing room. He really did bring an awful lot to the dressing room as well. He’s one of those payers you thought you could rely on and you could turn to him in a desperate situation. I feel now, even at United, he won’t be one of those players that will ruffle the dressing room and upset the way things are going. I think he will get on with his job as a professional but he will want to play football before his career ends.</p>

  <p><b>[An advance <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> party consisting of ‘Everton in the Community’ team led by former midfielder Leon Osman arrived in Kenya on Monday]</b> What sets <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> apart from the other <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> clubs is coming to East Africa and playing teams from this part of the world. The team’s visit to Tanzania was amazing and to be back to this region again is a commitment to the partnership the club has with SportPesa</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Osman says <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s crossbar-hitting skills proved he was special]</b> From the moment he walked into the training ground you knew he was going to be special. Already, physically developed; I’m four or five years older than him and he was already bigger and more powerful than me so you knew he was going to be a player. Even when he was 14, there were videos going round of ridiculous things he was doing in youth cup matches. One of the moments you go out before training to get warm, players having a chuckle and passing the ball and Wayne would just charge out and claim he’s going to hit the crossbar from the halfway line, something I couldn’t think about and he took it, hit the bar and you think ‘Who’s this kid here?! No chance, that’s a fluke.’ Then he did it again, twice on the run. Who is this kid?<br /><br />No, none at all. There was disappointment we couldn’t keep him at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> longer than we did but he’s gone on to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s all-time scorer, he’s England’s current record goalscorer, he was always going to achieve things</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Osman says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has always been ahead of his time]</b> He was a really good player, technically fantastic, his delivery, his attitude, he’d probably be in the top three or four (of players played with). What he brought to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was a change in attitude off the pitch. That culture, he was the point in football, the foreign players changed things but he improved standards, no drinking, real professionalism, extra care in what he ate. How well he could be playing, so fit and you wanted to be at that standard too. He was ahead of his time, he was a student of the game and I always felt he would go into management because he sees the game in a good way, he’s tactically very good and became captain with his leadership quality. To see him with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, the education he will have got in that stint as assistant manager will have improved him. People are saying nothing but good things about his first decisions and what he’s done</p>
