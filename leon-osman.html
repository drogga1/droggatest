  <p><b>[An advance <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> party consisting of ‘Everton in the Community’ team led by former midfielder Leon Osman arrived in Kenya on Monday]</b> What sets <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> apart from the other <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> clubs is coming to East Africa and playing teams from this part of the world. The team’s visit to Tanzania was amazing and to be back to this region again is a commitment to the partnership the club has with SportPesa</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Osman says Rooney’s crossbar-hitting skills proved he was special]</b> From the moment he walked into the training ground you knew he was going to be special. Already, physically developed; I’m four or five years older than him and he was already bigger and more powerful than me so you knew he was going to be a player. Even when he was 14, there were videos going round of ridiculous things he was doing in youth cup matches. One of the moments you go out before training to get warm, players having a chuckle and passing the ball and Wayne would just charge out and claim he’s going to hit the crossbar from the halfway line, something I couldn’t think about and he took it, hit the bar and you think ‘Who’s this kid here?! No chance, that’s a fluke.’ Then he did it again, twice on the run. Who is this kid?<br /><br />No, none at all. There was disappointment we couldn’t keep him at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> longer than we did but he’s gone on to be Manchester United’s all-time scorer, he’s England’s current record goalscorer, he was always going to achieve things</p>

  <p><b>[Leon Osman says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has always been ahead of his time]</b> He was a really good player, technically fantastic, his delivery, his attitude, he’d probably be in the top three or four (of players played with). What he brought to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was a change in attitude off the pitch. That culture, he was the point in football, the foreign players changed things but he improved standards, no drinking, real professionalism, extra care in what he ate. How well he could be playing, so fit and you wanted to be at that standard too. He was ahead of his time, he was a student of the game and I always felt he would go into management because he sees the game in a good way, he’s tactically very good and became captain with his leadership quality. To see him with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, the education he will have got in that stint as assistant manager will have improved him. People are saying nothing but good things about his first decisions and what he’s done</p>
