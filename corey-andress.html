  <p><b>[Global community franchise lead Corey Andress on The FIFA community exploded when ‘Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment’ was unearthed]</b> For those that will ask why it took us a while to respond, we wanted to be 100% sure that this patent didn’t exist in the game. This includes all aspects - every mode and gameplay. Hopefully this ends speculation, and appreciate the patience while we got the answer.<br /><br />Also important to note that this was an EA patent and it wasn’t specific to FIFA. This might help other titles (I don’t know the use in other places), but it wouldn’t make sense for us</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA 20 career mode slammed for being ‘unplayable’]</b> Wanted to take a few minutes and address some of the concerns regarding career mode, some of the action being taken internally and also speak on why some fixes take more time than others<br /><br />First off, definitely want to acknowledge the feedback and we’ve been tracking a lot of the posts and initial complaints on various platforms<br /><br />Let me say that the team is aware and prioritizing fixes for this area and have been successful in identifying some of the issues. In terms of an ETA or exact changes, I can’t provide that yet, but also want to be transparent and say it won’t be immediate. Being that Career Mode is client-based (offline), we need to patch. Patches take time as fixes have to be identified, fixed, tested and then certified by first-party. Our first patch is on the way and locked, so likely we’ve missed the ability to put CM fixes in that patch<br /><br />I am fully aware that that is not what you want to hear, but I also don’t want to leave you without answers on this one. We are continuing to prioritise and push these issues with urgency, so hopefully we’ll have more to share soon</p>
