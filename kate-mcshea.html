  <p><b>[Former Matildas star Kate McShea wants <a href="ante-milicic.html">Ante Milicic</a>’s future as Australia’s coach decided now]</b> We don’t want another debacle like before the World Cup. It’s sooner rather than later (that) a call needs to be made. He’s got his contract to Macarthur … preparation-wise is he going to be able to commit to all of the camps?<br /><br />You can’t really see a full-time A-League coach being able to be a full-time Matildas coach at the same time, and them get the preparation that they need<br /><br /><b>[McShea is also tipping senior Matildas, such as ex-Brisbane Roar teammates Claire Polkinghorne and <a href="elise-kellond-knight.html">Elise Kellond-Knight</a>, to push on for at least another year in order to play at the rescheduled Olympics]</b><br /><br />It’s not like they’re bench players, they’re generally in the starting XI for Matildas. It’s really the unknown for everybody at the moment so everyone’s sort of adapting but I think those sorts of players, an Olympics is something you keep going for.<br /><br /><b>[McShea is also hopeful the suspension of football due to the pandemic globally will refresh several key Matildas such as <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a>, Caitlin Foord and Chloe Logarzo after a hectic 18-month schedule of club and international football]</b> This in a way could be a good mental break for all of them. They can reset and they’ve got more than 12 months to start focusing again. I know sometimes a break in a routine is a good thing for an athlete. Reset yourself, reset your goals and freshen up a little bit which I think the girls will take in their stride</p>
