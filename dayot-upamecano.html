And afterwards, I know that I am being courted, that there are clubs that want me. I will talk well with my agents and my parents at the end of the season. And we will make the right decision</p>

  <p><b>[Dayot Upamecano admits that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did show some interest in him before his move to Germany, but he says it was limited]</b> They spoke to my agents in November as if they wanted to do a deal very quickly, but then they postponed everything for one reason or another. And so until the end of January, they asked me to wait. Then they saw that I had almost completed a deal with Leipzig. I was already committed. I wanted to go to a team that had a present and future project for me. Leipzig offered it to me and other teams did not. They showed that they loved me more</p>
