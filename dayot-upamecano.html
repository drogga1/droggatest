  <p><b>[RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano has dropped the biggest hint yet that he could make a move to one of Europe’s big guns]</b> When you’re young, you dream of Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United. But to get there, you have to work. I’m proud of myself, very happy. I have to continue in this manner. Then I can look higher. For the moment, my preference is Leipzig. After that, we’ll see.<br /><br />All the big players are internationals, and I would like to be called one day. I know I’m on the right path and so I have to continue like this</p>

  <p><b>[Dayot Upamecano admits that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did show some interest in him before his move to Germany, but he says it was limited]</b> They spoke to my agents in November as if they wanted to do a deal very quickly, but then they postponed everything for one reason or another. And so until the end of January, they asked me to wait. Then they saw that I had almost completed a deal with Leipzig. I was already committed. I wanted to go to a team that had a present and future project for me. Leipzig offered it to me and other teams did not. They showed that they loved me more</p>
