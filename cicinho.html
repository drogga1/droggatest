  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Roma defender Cicinho reveals his battle with alcoholism]</b> I’m a guy who can’t sit and have one or two glasses. I have to drink until I fall over. They said to me: ‘If you keep going with this life, you will die’. And I had an encounter with Jesus after 18 caipirinhas and 14 long necks <b>[of beer]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> right-back Cicinho has revealed that club president <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> essentially offered <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> a blank cheque to prevent him from retiring back in 2006]</b> In his farewell match, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> was very emotional. We were also as he was a legend who was leaving the game. Then, <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> came into the dressing room and greeted the players one by one. What happened next was unforgettable. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s highest salary at the time was €6.5 million (£6m/$7m). <b>[Former Madrid attacker]</b> Robinho jokingly said: ‘Mr. President, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> said that if you sign a two-year contract for €6.5 million, he won’t stop playing’. Everyone laughed, but Florentino was serious and replied: ‘If you want, I will bring you the paper now so that you can sign it’.<br /><br /><a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> thought about it for a second, looked at him and said, ‘No, no… I don’t want any more’<br /><br /><a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> was like the conductor of an orchestra. He always helped us position ourselves on the field. Before games, he guided everyone. He was already a coach on the pitch <b>[back then]</b>. Florentino always said that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> played with a suit, such was his elegance on the field. He didn’t even break a sweat! It was beautiful to watch him play</p>
