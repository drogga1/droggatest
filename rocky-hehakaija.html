  <p><b>[What will be the lasting impact of the Women’s World Cup?]</b> I think years from now, we’ll look back at this tournament and say, ‘yo, this was a turning point.’ And that’s why I keep on saying that this is such a special momentum because after this World Cup, I think that more sponsors and more federations will step up to the plate to do more to elevate the game<br /><br />Talking from the Dutch perspective, this is the second time we have qualified for the World Cup and we made it to the final. That’s just something that has to elevate the game in the country. I know that they are already taking steps to do that. The wheels have to start turning more, but it’s starting<br /><br />If I compare it to me playing for the national team, I dreamed about playing football in sold-out stadiums, so the fact that we are seeing it and it is actually happening is crazy<br /><br /><b>[What was your favorite Women’s World Cup moment]</b> The speech from <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> after the game when they got knocked out by France. <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> is my biggest idol … and the impact of that speech, the emotional rawness of that speech, still touches me to the core and it’s one of my main takeaways. And of course the Dutch qualifying for the final, but <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> for sure stands out</p>
