<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> manager Howard Wilkinson has hailed <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> for his role in inspiring the club to championship glory]</b> Gary had great values; he was modest, generous and certainly made the most if not more of his talent that he was entitled to and he made a terrific contribution to our success at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. He was only young but he played with great distinction alongside <a href="gary-mcallister.html">Gary McAllister</a>, <a href="gordon-strachan.html">Gordon Strachan</a> and David Batty and I think it is fair to say that you would struggle to find a better midfield than that today. Gary was unselfish, hard working and he had an eye for goal. He scored one goal every five games which suggests that he was just an attacking midfielder but he was of equal value in our penalty box because of his immense ability in the air. I remember when we won away at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> in the championship season early doors and he cracked in a wonderful 25-yarder and I thought this might just be our season and so it proved.<br /><br /><b>[Wilkinson handed Speed his debut when the Welshman was just 19]</b> I first saw him as a young trainee playing left-back in a <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> youth game and we talked about him at the time and suggested that might also have a go as playing wide on the left side of midfield. But in fact in his time at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> he ended up playing in nine of the ten outfield positions without ever complaining<br /><br />As with everything Gary did while in football he did it in the right way and I am certain that he would have really made a mark in management and he had already got Wales going in the right direction. Gary had approached management like he did his playing career in that he worked very hard at it and recognised the need for education. He got that education and poured a lot of work into coaching and management at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> with their young players, the reserves and then the first team before taking over the Wales team. Under Gary they had won four of their last five games and soared through the Fifa rankings.<br /><br /><b>[Wilkinson admitted he had been left baffled when it emerged that Speed had taken his own life at the age of 42]</b> At this moment in time my thoughts are about him as a person and it is very difficult to get out of my mind the fact that he has left behind two boys and a wife, Louise, and his parents and it is just not like him. In my experience what has happened is something that I would never ever have associated with Gary. Gary was just a well normal, well-balanced steady person who was always full of respect for everyone not just within football but among the wider public as well. It is an unbelievable shock. It is a great loss to football and the world as a whole and obviously a loss that they will never recover from for his family</p>

  <p><b>[How England created ‘the Oxford and Cambridge’ of youth development]</b> When I went to the FA, I went with a view that youth development could be dramatically improved. When I joined Leeds, they had already signed 18 schoolboys, of which only one became a pro. I think in my final year there we signed seven, of which all seven became pros. Five of them featured for Leeds and, indeed, were part of the squad for the <b>[2001]</b> Champions League semi-final<br /><br />As a country, we needed to start to tackle youth development so that we got better players coming through and those better players - not all of them would be English - but the English ones would benefit the English teams. It wasn’t just me. There’s a lot of significant people along the road there. Myself, Robin Russell, Les Reed, John McDermott - one of the best youth developers in Britain if not Europe. I had an immensely talented squad working with me<br /><br />What I wanted, and what we created, was a pathway whereby there was consistency in what we did with the players. If we identified the best players in England at 15, we wanted those players to have a parallel development. I used to tell them, ‘You’ve got two career paths now. You’ve got the career path in professional football at club level and you’ve got a career path in international football, and the two are interconnected. If you do well in one, you’re going to do well with the other<br /><br />There are major differences; the number of days you’re in the England setup and the number of days you’re with your club, and the amount of time you have got. It’s important that if we identify them at 15, they start learning. It shouldn’t be as it used to be: I’m playing with the 18s, I’m now in the 21s - they’ve got a different manager and he’s doing it his way. The coaches have got to be themselves, but they have got to do it the England way<br /><br />It was a comprehensive strategy, but we needed a symbolic heart. We needed a home. I said I wanted it to be the Oxford and Cambridge of English football; it was essential to the whole plan. I identified the site of St George’s Park. In 2002, we started laying the pitches and then, all of a sudden, I left in 2002 and, in 2003, the eye was taken off the ball. St George’s Park was mothballed, the new Wembley was initiated and the cost of the new Wembley ballooned. It wasn’t until 2008 that St George’s Park and all that it stood for got back onto the agenda and it was only narrowly voted through. Then, it opened in 2013. Instead of opening in 2002 or 2003. The whole saga - will we have St George’s Park or won’t we? - was overtaken by the need to build a new Wembley, whose cost tripled. We paid a heavy price for that<br /><br />St George’s Park was important because it was a hub; it was symbolic. You can’t have any sort of organisation if you haven’t got a place that is home. What matters more than the symbolism is the plan. That’s what’s crucial - the plan - and making sure it’s implemented properly<br /><br />It was a raft of proposals which I took to the FA and developed. And they accepted it. It was football academies. We introduced charter standards and kite markings for grassroots clubs. The FA Coaches Association was introduced. We introduced the Pro Licence. And, obviously, the development strategies for the national men’s and women’s national teams. That was important. I appointed Hope Powell as the first full-time England coach for the ladies. So, it wouldn’t have been possible without a comprehensive plan. Take it from me, you don’t get a good school unless you’ve got good teachers. And you don’t get a good school if you haven’t got good leaders and a good head. What we have now is good teachers. The basics have got to be there. And as that child goes through the school developing, the learning pathway has got to be as good as it can be and appropriate to the objectives. The learning pathway as far as the England players are concerned, is one which is coherent and cohesive<br /><br />Thankfully, Dan Ashworth took the baton. When St George’s Park was mothballed, the plan was not quite put on hold but the plan was slowed down dramatically. The proposal to restart in 2008 was only narrowly agreed by the FA council. It wasn’t as if it was a landslide. Fortunately, we are now back on track<br /><br />At the moment - from under-17 up to under-21 - we’re top of the world rankings. Trophies are important because they rubberstamp that which you are doing. The fact that we are now ranked No.1 from under-21 down is a vindication of what we are doing and that’s important. What Gareth did in Moscow was immense, getting us to where we were. What the players who are now in the England setup know is we’ve been there, seen it, done it. That’s vindication of what we are doing. That’s telling you our methods are right. It’s overcoming these barriers all the time<br /><br />The quality and quantity of coach education from grassroots right through to pro level is first class. Can it be improved? Things can always be improved. If you’ve got good leadership in any organisation, it will always be guarding against complacency. It will always be asking the question: ‘What can we do better?’<br /><br />Gareth’s been in it with the under-21s. He’s steeped in it. Now he’s in it with the England team. He’ll give you chapter and verse on what the learning programmes are, how they are being constantly investigated and developed<br /><br />Late 90s, just past 2000, England was becoming a finishing school for French players. They were getting schooled in France until they were 18 and then English clubs were buying them and bringing them here. They were testing their mettle in our league. Now, it’s almost gone the other way. We’re changing perception. The fact that we’ve got kids schooled in England playing in the Bundesliga is enormous. The Bundesliga is a strong league</p>
