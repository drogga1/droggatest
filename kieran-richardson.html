  <p><b>[former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> midfielder Kieran Richardson says <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> is David Ginola-esque]</b> <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, he’s a phenomenal talent. When I was there <b>[Villa]</b> playing he was coming through and you could see from the get-go he was a top, top player. He hasn’t made his England debut yet has he? It’s going to come, it will come eventually, he’s a good player. It’s tough competition <b>[for England]</b>, very tough. The competition is very hard but I think that he will get his chance at one point<br /><br />The way he can just ghost past players, he’s so strong, he rides challenges. Even if you knock him down he’ll get back up and keep going, he won’t shy away from anything. He’s very confident on the ball, he’ll take the ball whenever he can. He’s a top player and the way he’s built as well, he’s massive, his legs are absolutely massive. Even when I first saw him I was like ‘This guy’s a unit’. You saw his goal against <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> when he put it top corner, the quality he has<br /><br />Do you know who he reminds me of? <a href="david-ginola.html">Ginola</a>, where he just goes past players, he can do that all day long, he’s got a great change of pace as well. I can see him at United, easily</p>
