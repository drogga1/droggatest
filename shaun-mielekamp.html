  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners have accepted Roy O’Donovan’s one-match suspension for elbowing Melbourne City’s Michael Jakobsen]</b> Whilst we accept the decision and understand the process, this hurts as a double whammy. Not only did Roy miss out on 70 minutes against City but he now also misses an additional match. The MRP did what they could within the regulations they have before them and as a club we could not risk the possibility of missing Roy for an additional week if we put in an appeal for an obvious error that has such a high threshold. To ensure better consistency there should be parameters or avenues that protect the player and the club from being dealt a double blow</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners CEO Shaun Mielekamp has revealed the A-League club are working hard to sign former Perth Glory midfielder Daniel De Silva]</b> It’s looking positive but until they sign on the dotted line you can never say for sure. If it all goes through Daniel will be an important recruit for us. He and Paulo are close and have been talking for some time. We hoped it would happen in January but couldn’t get it over the line back then.</p>

  <p><b>[Usain Bolt to the A-League: World’s fastest man set to join Central Coast Mariners]</b> This is a very real football opportunity, this is not a stunt or gimmick - we want to know if Usain can play. If he can, let’s light up the A-League and bring one of the biggest named athletes in sport to the Central Coast.<br /><br /><b>[Mielekamp made it clear Bolt would only be signed if he impressed during the trial]</b> From our perspective it will only be big if he can play. The trial is really important because if he comes and he’s not up to the level then it actually has a detrimental effect. But if he comes and he’s as good as our reports are saying that he can be then that would be very exciting</p>

  <p><b>[On Usain Bolt]</b> His training program will be structured to see if he can reach the level of play needed to earn a professional contract. This may take three weeks, this may take three months or this may take six months. It could take longer. Only time will tell, but it’s exciting to see what this will do for our region. The importance for us right now is to look after an athlete coming here to try and become a professional player.</p>
