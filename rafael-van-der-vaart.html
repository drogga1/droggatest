  <p><b>[Van der Vaart warns the Dutch not to underestimate first game]</b> Everybody’s talking about Germany, Portugal. But Denmark also have a strong team. The first game of a tournament is always the most important one. For us, the first game is the most vital one. Everyone is speaking about Germany and Portugal, but Denmark has a very good young, talented team, and I’m sure they will be ready for us. We have to make sure we are ready for them<br /><br /><b>[Van der Vaart was certain Holland were up to the challenge, saying]</b> It’s a really tough group and, from the beginning, you have to play at your best level, so it’s going to be difficult. The confidence is there, we have a great squad, so everybody’s 100 per cent<br /><br />There’s Spain, Germany and we are also one of the favourites. It’s never easy but, if you see the squad we have, all the players are around 27, 28, 29. You don’t get many chances to win a prize and this is an opportunity for us<br /><br /><b>[Holland play all their group matches in Kharkiv, Ukraine, but have based themselves in Krakow, Poland. Van der Vaart and <a href="dirk-kuyt.html">Kuyt</a> shrugged off the possible impact of flying to and from games]</b> I think we have a great hotel here and the pitch is fantastic, the stadium, everything is nice. So, we’re all happy that we are based here. We fly one day before the game, we fly to Kharkiv, so I think it’s okay</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael van der Vaart says he has better technique than his former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He is a phenomenon. If you trained with him, you were more impressed by the athlete. I dare say that I have a better technique. Many people will say I’m off track, but it is so. When you see what he put into his training, it is extraordinary how fit he is.</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands international Rafael van der Vaart lined out for Spurs between 2010 and 2012, and is confident that his former club can win in Saturday’s early kick-off]</b> It’s not easy to win because Arsenal is still a great team, great club. But now Tottenham, winning against Madrid, being in this position, I’m 100 per cent sure that they will win there.</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael van der Vaart believes only Real Madrid have the quality and experience necessary to beat Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in the Champions League]</b> Madrid is a great club with fantastic players and facilities. <b>[When]</b> they played against PSG, the Parisians had money, but they still couldn’t beat Real Madrid. I think Madrid still has got the quality to win the Champions League again. But I’m a little bit surprised that they’re not doing well enough in the La Liga.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if anyone could stop City]</b> I think the only one is Real Madrid. Everybody nowadays is praising Manchester City and complaining about Arsenal, but to be fair, you have to see things. When you or me take charge at Manchester City and have €500 million to spend, we could lead the team to the last four in the Champions League. When you have that kind of money, you can buy everything. It’s a pity nowadays that <b>[clubs are allowed]</b> to buy a player for €222 million<br /><br /><b>[Guardiola]</b> showed that he is a great coach in Barcelona, and I think he needs one or two years everywhere to build the team and let the players know what he wants from them. They might be unbeatable in the Premier League, but they won’t make it in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Van der Vaart announced his retirement on November 5, 2018 after an injury-hit spell with Danish side Esbjerg]</b> I just have to stop now. I’m not here to rehabilitate, but to play football. I would have wanted to become a football grandpa, but that is not the case. I can only be grateful for all the years I was allowed to play football<br /><br /><b>[q: You grew up on a trailer park, didn’t you? What was that life like?]</b> I was raised there so to me it was just the normal life, but every time I’ve moved to a different country it’s been something I’ve been asked about, as it’s considered quite unusual. I had a wonderful time growing up. Many people think it’s linked to poverty but that’s not the case at all. It was very sociable, with other relatives living very close. My parents aren’t there any more, because after I signed my first contract at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> I bought them a house. But other family members are still on the park, so I still go back<br /><br /><b>[q: Is it true that you pretended to be <a href="romario.html">Romario</a> when you played as a kid? Why him? Were you a big <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> fan?]</b> Yes, <a href="romario.html">Romario</a> was my favourite player. Because of him I liked to watch <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a> a lot, but naturally I was an <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> fan, especially when I got drafted into their academy. What I really liked about him was that sometimes you’d barely see him for the whole match, but then at the very last minute he’d suddenly pop up with a moment of genius that would win <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> the game<br /><br /><b>[q: You were hailed as ‘the new Johan Cruyff’ very early in your career, so just how good were you? And how did you feel about the comparisons?]</b> Other people making those comparisons was all right, but personally I’ve never really liked to make them myself. I didn’t want to be the next version of any player - I wanted to establish my own name. When I was younger, I always knew I was a pretty good player, but it was impossible to foresee how far I’d go. I had a left foot and vision like no one else, but I wasn’t the quickest and my right foot wasn’t so great, so there were things I needed to work on. I’ve always said the one change that would’ve been nice is if I’d been a bit faster - like fast enough to be able to run past people instead of just being overtaken all the time! I think speed can make a huge difference, to the extent that if I’d been quicker, I believe I could have won the Ballon d’Or at some point during my career<br /><br /><b>[q: What was your best moment at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>?]</b> There were several highlights. When I was young, the best moment came when I was 10 and I got invited to the academy. I remember getting all this <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> training gear and suddenly I was able to call myself an <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> player. From then on, my goal every season was to remain at the club and then make my debut in the first team. I managed to do it when I was 17. I can clearly recall the phone call I made to my dad to tell him that I’d been picked for the senior squad. Once I established myself in the first team, my best ever moment came when I scored with a backheel against Feyenoord. When you’ve scored a goal like that, you realise you’are unlikely to experience a more unique momen<br /><br /><b>[q: What’s the truth regarding you and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>? Did he really threaten to break your legs? How did your relationship turn so sour?]</b> Yes, he did say that, but <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> said it to everyone. It’s also true that around that time things just weren’t working between the two of us, but I would rather be in a team with people who are honest, like him, even if it means there are a few arguments. But there wasn’t a specific moment we fell out - we generally didn’t get along well<br /><br /><b>[q: At <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> you were stripped of the club captaincy by <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a>, after it was reported that you refused to play on the wing in a Champions League game. Is that what happened? What were your feelings towards <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a>?]</b> Yeah, that one is true. One day, before a game against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, Ronald came to me and said: At this moment, you aren’t good enough to play for us as a midfielder but we want you to play as a left-winger. I wasn’t happy with that, because if I wasn’t good enough to play in my natural role, how could I be considered good enough to play out of position? In the end, I asked to be on the bench, which eventually led to me being stripped of the captaincy. Later on, after we’d both left <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, we recognised the mistakes we’d made. I’m the first to admit when my actions aren’t the smartest, and that incident showed a lack of respect to Koeman<br /><br /><b>[q: How did you feel when <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> used his column in De Telegraaf to criticise your transfer to Hamburg? Why did you move there when so many other clubs were interested?]</b> I’m never that bothered by someone giving his opinion in a column. But with regards to my Hamburg move, I can remember I wasn’t really keen when they first approached me. I agreed to visit the club and the reception I got was incredible. I spoke with manager Thomas Doll and the directors Bernd Hoffmann and Dietmar Beiersdorfer, and their vision was really impressive. I got to see the stadium, which was phenomenal, and soon I realised that this was the club I wanted to sign for.<br /><br /><b>[q: Describe what it was like playing for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>? How intense was the experience? Could you go anywhere in Madrid without fans everywhere asking for autographs and pictures?]</b> Overall I had a really good time there, but yes, it was very difficult to go out somewhere in Madrid without getting noticed all the time. In London it was less of an issue, and here in Denmark it’s even quieter. But generally it’s nice when people come up to you or have a little chat, although I’m not overly keen on crowds. I’m not complaining about it, though, because if you don’t really want that lifestyle, you should just remain as an amateur footballer<br /><br /><b>[q: There were rumours of a falling out between you and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> boss Juande Ramos when you were often deployed as a substitute. Did you get frustrated about that, and what was your relationship with the manager?]</b> There was no falling out, but he wasn’t my favourite coach in the world. There was no mutual ‘click’, and the type of football he played wasn’t the style that I associated with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - and it didn’t really suit my own style, either<br /><br /><b>[q: You were linked with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> during your time in Madrid. Was there ever a possibility of that move happening?]</b> Yeah, it did get mentioned. I had several conversations with <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>, my team-mate with the Dutch side, and he’d spoken to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> about me a few times, but I never heard anything. I didn’t regret it - joining <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> was the best thing that happened to me. I actually had the chance to move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> a lot earlier. When I was about 19, <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> wanted to take me to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was flattered, of course, but at the time I wasn’t that interested in moving abroad. However, my agent said it would be a good idea to give <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Houllier</a> a call. He explained that he’d talked about me with <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a>, who’d said he would be very happy to play with me at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was amazing to hear that, but I was still sure I wanted to remain at Ajax<br /><br /><b>[q: Were you upset that you initially weren’t given a squad number in your second season with Madrid?]</b> It wasn’t easy, but I was able to pull through. The coach <b>[<a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>]</b> told me at the start of the season that I was his fifth choice in my preferred position, behind <a href="guti.html">Guti</a>, <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, <b>[Esteban]</b> Granero and Raul. I remember I had to train separately from the rest of the squad, like running alone around the training ground. But once the transfer window closed, I was reintegrated into the group. In the end, I was a regular starter in my position and put in some very good performances. People might argue that my time with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was unsuccessful, but look at the stats and you’ll see that I played a lot of games and scored quite a lot of goals. When I look back on my <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> career, I do so with a lot of fondness.<br /><br /><b>[q: In 109 games for the Netherlands, what was the most special moment?]</b> The Euro 2008 group matches against Italy and France. It was pure pleasure to be on the pitch in those two games - I could’ve played for about six hours and not got tired. Both Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup were brilliant to be a part of. In 2008 we were all thinking, ‘Wow, we are really good’, but it wasn’t like we were expecting to go and win the tournament. In 2010, it was more or less the opposite. We had a feeling like, ‘We don’t play that impressively, but no one is going to beat us’. That’s probably the best feeling you can have as a team during a major tournament<br /><br /><b>[q: The Netherlands looked brilliant in the group stage at Euro 2008 - were you the favourites to win it ahead of Spain at that point? What happened against Russia in the quarter-finals?]</b> At that point I think we were probably the favourites along with Spain. I think we were unlucky in the match against Russia. I took several free-kicks which went just wide and we had some other chances as well. We equalised near the end of normal time, but in extra time the Russians were still unbelievably fit. It was 40 degrees and they kept going<br /><br /><b>[q: What are your thoughts on referee Howard Webb over his handling of the 2010 World Cup Final? Having come on as a sub during extra time, what went through your mind as <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> scored the winner?]</b> The referee had a difficult game. You know, with about a minute or two to play in extra time, we got a free-kick and <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Wesley Sneijder</a>’s shot definitely took a deflection, but somehow Spain were awarded a goal-kick - we couldn’t believe that decision. Soon after, Spain got the ball into our box. We didn’t get rid of it properly, and I tried to save the situation but was too late. I don’t want to say the moment we should have had a corner decided it, but we thought: ‘How is it possible?’<br /><br /><b>[q: Your switch to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> seemed to come out of nowhere - how long before transfer deadline day did you find out about it? Was it a surprise even to you? Did you wake up that day with no idea where you’d go?]</b> It was very last minute. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> had been honest about my chances at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, telling me they’d bought <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> to play in my position. He said I could stay, but that I wasn’t in his starting XI. At that point I was still keen to stay at Real for another season, so I headed to a training camp with the national team.<br /><br />But at around 4pm on deadline day, my lawyer called me to say <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were interested in signing me. I asked him if I could think about it. He replied that I had to decide within two hours! I started to evaluate everything, then took a little nap. Suddenly I was jolted awake by the phone going off. It was about 5.40pm and my lawyer was on the phone again, telling me that I had to decide there and then. I thought for a split second, then said, ‘Yeah, let’s do it!’ I had no time to overthink it or discuss it with anybody - it was pure intuition. Very soon I realised how happy I was with the decision. From the moment I arrived at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> Lodge, the club’s former training ground, I felt at home<br /><br /><b>[q: How did <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> compare to your previous managers? He must have been pretty different]</b> He was a magical guy - a father figure - but Harry could also be rock-hard. He was very much an old-school type of coach. During a team talk, he’d pull out a little piece of paper on which he’d written down the starting XI and would say things to us like, ‘Just give the ball to Luka <b>[<a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a>]</b>, then Luka can try to find Rafa, and you will win the game’. Then, if we’d played a really good first half, he would openly praise you, saying things like, ‘Fucking hell, Rafa, what a player!’. He gave you a boost - you would run faster for someone like him. Redknapp’s style suited my own very well, and it all fitted in perfectly with my overall positive image of the English game while I was at the club<br /><br /><b>[q: Why did you kiss that old woman after you scored in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s 2-1 victory against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in October 2010? Was she shocked?]</b> I remember that! After scoring, I ran into a corner of fans and actually fell into her arms. It was more like a hug. It seemed like a lady of 80 years old - I don’t know who she was<br /><br /><b>[q: In your short career with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> you managed to score a lot of goals against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and gave their fans some stick, too. Do you still hate the Gooners? How did the North London Derby compare to your other derbies?]</b> I never had anything against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but when I joined <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> I tried to learn about the club’s traditions and I soon found out about the magnitude of the match. I always try to immerse myself in the emotions of the fans, and in the derbies against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I tried to give <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans a little bit of their pride back. I wanted them to have something to cheer about at work the next morning. Other derbies I played in were really special, too. Real against Atletico was a good atmosphere, and I played in El Clasico. That isn’t strictly a derby, but it’s seen globally as the biggest game of the year - you can definitely feel it. All over the world, people are talking about it, and it almost feels as if you’re going to play the World Cup final.<br /><br /><b>[q: Did <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a> say anything to you after you’d utterly humiliated him by nutmegging him twice in the space of a few seconds?]</b> I don’t remember him saying anything to me. All I remember is what I said to him afterwards: Close your legs next time! I still regard that Spurs-Arsenal game <b>[in April 2011]</b> as my best day in football. It was on a warm spring night, with a little evening sun and a brilliant atmosphere in the stadium - just the perfect footballing conditions. I had one of my best games that night. We went 1-0 down, I scored the equaliser, but then we let in two before pulling it back to 3-3, with me scoring another goal. <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> missed a big chance to make it 4-3 towards the end, which was a pity because we needed to win. I don’t think the supporters had often experienced a derby quite as good as that one - it was an incredible match<br /><br /><b>[q: Why did <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fall away in 2011/12, having looked like being right in the title race? Did the England rumours around <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> distract the players? <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were amazing in the opening six months of that season …]</b> I remember in the January we played a big match against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, who were five points ahead of us at that point. We were 2-0 down, before coming back to 2-2. In stoppage time we got this big chance, where <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> raced away, only to play the ball just too far in front of <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Jermain Defoe</a>, who poked it wide. Moments later we gave away a penalty. <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> scored it, we lost the game and the gap became eight points, which was a huge blow to our title aspirations. Until then, we’d been in such good form that it felt as if we had a genuine opportunity to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title<br /><br /><b>[q: You’ve gone on record as saying how much you regret leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, so how exactly did that exit come about? Did you not really see eye to eye with AVB?]</b> <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Andre Villas-Boas</a> wasn’t the ideal coach for me. He bought <a href="gylfi-sigurdsson.html">Gylfi Sigurdsson</a> and then told me he would be his new No.10. I found that a little bit strange considering what I’d achieved over the previous two years. I started the first match of the season on the subs’ bench, so when Hamburg approached me, I thought it was a nice opportunity to go back. But I shouldn’t have left <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, though it’s always easy to say that with hindsight. I had some brilliant times during my second spell in Hamburg, but the fact that we were in the relegation play-off in the second and third seasons wasn’t good<br /><br /><b>[q: Where has it all gone wrong for Hamburg since your first spell there? They were Champions League regulars back then, but now they seem to be struggling at the bottom every season…]</b> I don’t know. To be honest, when I moved back to Hamburg I was underwhelmed with the quality of their squad, especially as I’d come from such a good team at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. Still, we managed to go from bottom of the table up to seventh place. That was a big achievement<br /><br /><b>[q: You took your grandmother along to your unveiling at <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> - what was the story behind that? There is a picture where she was kissing you and you looked a bit embarrassed]</b> Not at all - it was great that she was able to be there. My grandparents on my mother’s side are from Spain and live not too far from Seville, so they came over to see my unveiling, as they did when I went to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, too. It was great that they could attend.<br /><br /><b>[q: How did your move to Midtjylland happen? Did you pick a team in Denmark because your partner currently plays handball there for Esbjerg?]</b> There were a few factors in my decision. Firstly, my girlfriend (Estavana Polman), plays handball in Esbjerg. She’s got a long, successful career ahead of her, so I was hoping that I could live quite close to her. At the same time, I wasn’t playing a lot for <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> and Midtjylland showed an interest, so it was a win-win situation. Also, I’m still not that far away from Hamburg, where my 11-year-old son from a previous marriage lives. <b>[FFT: Have you ever played handball?]</b> No, she hasn’t taught me anything yet!<br /><br /><b>[q: What would say was the biggest mistake in your football career?]</b> Leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> was not my best choice, but apart from that, there haven’t been too many big regrets during my career<br /><br /><b>[q: Be honest - do you ever wish that you’d been able to play in a different era when attacking midfielders and playmakers got appreciated by managers more, rather than now when they’re asked to track back and do as much defensive work as the rest of the team?]</b> I’ve experienced some good times, but yes, we seem to have experienced a tipping point. Nowadays, there’s a lot more emphasis on pace and power in teams, and technically refined players seem to have less of a chance to shine. I experienced that at <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>, three years ago. I started off pretty well, but then I picked up an injury and couldn’t get back in the team. The manager <b>[Pepe Mel]</b> told me that I was the best player on the ball but that he needed another kind of player in midfield.<br /><br />When I saw the team, I couldn’t believe it - these players would kick the ball straight out of the stadium, but still get applauded as they were running around and doing lots of slide tackles. That’s not the kind of player I wanted to be.

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo should have followed the lead of eternal rival Lionel Messi and stayed at Real Madrid]</b> You know, guys like Messi… Messi will never leave Barcelona. I’m slightly sad about Ronaldo’s departure.<br /><br /><b>[Van der Vaart admits there was initially rival interest in his signature as he prepared to leave Hamburg]</b> I do not know anything about <b>[interest from]</b> Atletico Madrid. Valencia - yes, they wanted to buy me and were ready to pay big money, but Hamburg refused. So I said ‘okay’ and stayed. And then when Real Madrid came it was an easy decision, especially considering that my mother is from Spain and I’m half Spanish. My family still lives there, so it was just fantastic. It is the greatest club in the world, so it was something special. Real are the only club whose shirt I wore every day and thought: ‘Wow, I did it!’. That is what is so great about Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[The qualities of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen have helped Tottenham to become one of the world’s top five clubs]</b> I’m not surprised that they are doing so well. I already knew that they have great players, but recently they have made great progress and are now in the top five in the world. I always say that they became the best in the world because they trained with me! In my day we had a lot more players with a great name, but the current line-up acts more like a team. And, of course, they are talented. Kane scores a lot, Eriksen has incredible talent, Dele Alli also scores. Now they have more opportunities. I’m still very much a fan of Tottenham, so I want them to win something. I hope they will do soon.<br /><br />I hope that Tottenham will retain its leaders and finally become a champion. I think this is more important than selling players. Of course, everyone talks about Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli, but I think now they are really strong as a team</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael van der Vaart claims that Zlatan Ibrahimovic was jealous of him during their time together at Ajax]</b> This question is always asked of me more than any other. At that time we were both young and I was the best player in Ajax. He came to the club and believed that he was the best player at Ajax. Back then he did not act like he does now and I think he was a bit jealous. I did not have really big problems with him. It was just two egos converging in one place. I think I was a bigger problem for him than he was for me. But in general he is a sincere person with whom I sometimes had squabbles. But I am sure that if we met now there would be no problems.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed as to whether the pair could ever grace the same side again]</b> Perhaps, who knows. We are older, we have families and children. I think this changes you as a person. I made mistakes, so did he. In the end, we were young guys who aspired to reach the top and did all of this to achieve that</p>

The fun will be different and that’s what I want to be. I wanted to become a football grandpa, but unfortunately that is not the case. At this moment I can only be grateful for all the years I was allowed to play football. All those players, staff and fans, from the ArenA, the Volksparkstadion, White Hart Lane to the Bernabeu, I just have warm feelings about it. It was a great time.<br /><br /><b>[Looking back fondly on his career]</b> I won prizes and played in championships, both with my clubs, the Dutch national team and individually.

If you think about it as a child that you can play a World Cup finals … We were so terribly close. Those fans were really fantastic, and that’s not a joke. They were there for so many of the big tournaments, you will not forget that. Not giving those people a World Cup is the only blotch on my international career<br /><br /><b>[With his career now over, Van der Vaart now moves into his next stage, and he has a number of ideas on where to go]</b> I like the television work, I hope to continue in it.

What he did at Real is totally crazy. The quality in the squad is still there. They don’t need any winter signings. It’s always difficult to find suitable players in the winter to really help a team in this class. The team has to grow together again to compensate for the departure of Ronaldo.

  <p><b>[Real Madrid midfielder Isco has been hailed as the best player in the world]</b> Isco is crazy for me, the best player in the world. But he always has problems with coaches. Zinedine Zidane never trusted him 100 per cent. When Ajax play Madrid, I’ll see if he starts. If he is not, I’m going home.<br /><br />I really want to see that match between two great teams. Ajax are impressive, have many talents and win all their games playing fantastic football that I like to see. They go on the attack, they score a lot of goals, they have a spectacular team. It will be a very complicated match for Real Madrid, for sure.<br /><br />It is difficult to give a prediction. In Netherlands, people think that Ajax is going to win for sure, but I want to remind you that Madrid in the Champions League is Real Madrid. It is a difficult game for Ajax. They will have chances to get through, but they should be at the top to be in the quarter-finals.<br /><br />Right now everyone recognises how important he was for Real Madrid, someone who was scoring almost 60 goals per season. The team that has Cristiano in its ranks will always be a favourite. He makes his team-mates better. You give him the ball and you know he can score, he guarantees success<br /><br />I want them to stay in Amsterdam, but it is normal that they are receiving offers from the best because they play really well. They are impressive talents, they are at the top of the world and surely have a very big career. Although they are also very young, they must go step by step. De Jong reminds me of Guti, he has a lot of quality and he handles the ball as you would want from the centre of the field</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale’s future at Real Madrid]</b> I am a little surprised at what is happening at Real Madrid with Gareth Bale. He is a very good player, he is not Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> or <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, he is not a regular, he always plays well and there is more pressure than at Tottenham. I think that’s a problem for him. Going to succeed in another place? It may be best but I think he wants to stay at Real Madrid and play more. But a team like United or a return to Tottenham could be better for him because people in England are different to those in Spain.<br /><br />Bale is a very calm player, he wants to be alone, he does not have much contact with his team-mates. It is important, though, to speak Spanish in Spain and I think that he is a bit lonely inside the team. When he plays well nothing happens, but if he plays badly then you have problems</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid team-mate Rafael van der Vaart on Cristiano Ronaldo’s skill]</b> I remember one time we had training - he didn’t train that well - and after he took like 20 balls to practice his free kicks. He was hitting them and they went everywhere, but not to the target. I took one ball, I kicked it in and I said: ‘This is how you should do it’. The next game, free kick. I said, ‘Can I take it?’ He said, ‘No, I’m going to do this.’ He hit from 30 metres and it went into the top corner - fantastic. And he said, ‘This is the way I do it!’</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael van der Vaart has said in-demand Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt should join Bayern Munich]</b> Bayern must get De Ligt, he is absolutely a player for Munich. I would advise him to go there, although I always said that he would be a good match for Juventus. Bayern play in central defence with Niklas Sule, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, but it is not clear if Hummels and Boateng will remain. So, there would be room for De Ligt. The boy is a great talent, has a lot of quality.<br /><br />De Ligt is only 19 years old and has a charisma and self-confidence like a 30-year-old. He gets on really well in interviews, seems very clear in the head, down to earth and grown up. This is a player who does not hang his head after mistakes and keeps going. He is already a great role model for many talents in the Netherlands<br /><br /><b>[On Virgil van Dijk]</b> He has everything to be the best in the world. He is tall, has charisma and is an absolute leader at Liverpool. He is outstanding. He has everything and is well on the way to becoming the best centre-back in the world<br /><br />Before the game, of course, we thought again that we will win the game against the Germans. Up front they have enormous quality. They are brutally strong and they showed that again in the first half against Oranje. That was incredible. In the second half, however, you have seen what the Germans still lack a world-class team. On the defensive side, there are extreme weaknesses. Then you realise that they have not been in the formation for so long</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has been urged to become an asshole in a bid to win over Real Madrid’s fans]</b> It’s strange, but in Holland we say that sometimes you need to be an asshole. You can also be a positive asshole. He’s worth €100m - they paid a lot of money and he has to do it. In his last year at Spurs, he took every free-kick, he decided everything. That’s what he has to do now. I realise it’s difficult, because you have so many good players, but he should do it more.<br /><br />Gareth is an amazing player but he’s a person that has to feel the confidence. He has to feel he is welcome. But I know Real is a difficult club if you don’t perform. It doesn’t matter if you’re <b>[Cristiano]</b>Ronaldo, Bale or Van der Vaart - they’ll throw you out after just one year. You have to deal with it, and I don’t know if he can do that. I know him as a person and, with a Spurs hat, I always hope he’ll say, ‘Okay, I’ll come back’. I don’t think it’s going to happen, but that would be a nice story</p>

We talk about going to the gym and being strong and quick, but they can all play with the ball and, in the end, clever football wins. I never thought they could get this far but it is so nice to see everyone scared to play against Ajax. Johan Cruyff is our pride and the best player we’ve ever had, and I’m so happy two of his teams are in the semi-finals. I’m 100% sure they are going to play each other in the final<br /><br />Frenkie de Jong was one of my favourites tonight even though he didn’t play his best game.
