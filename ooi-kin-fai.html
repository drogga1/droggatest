<blockquote>
  <p>FMLLP’s tie up with <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> saw the former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star visit Kuala Lumpur and attend the National Football Awards as part of the partnership. Those that followed football post 2010 may not be well acquainted with who Ivan Campo is but the relatively older generation will no doubt remember fondly the big Spaniard who paraded one of the most recognisable hairstyles in the world of football<br /><br />A Champions League winner with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, Campo also spent time with Bolton Wanderers in the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> under the tutelage of <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a>. The unfashionable Bolton side that ended up housing big names like <a href="youri-djorkaeff.html">Youri Djorkaeff</a>, <a href="jay-jay-okocha.html">Jay-Jay Okocha</a>, <a href="el-hadji-diouf.html">El-Hadji Diouf</a> as well as a former Asian icon in Hidetoshi Nakata<br /><br />Like Campo, <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Nakata</a> built his name in another league, namely the Italian <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> before making the move to Bolton and the now 43-year-old Campo was effusive in his praise for the former Japan national team captain<br /><br />As part of the promotional activities in KL, Campo was undeniably the biggest name to grace the grand night of Malaysian football at the National Football Awards that was held in a hotel in Bandar Utama on Friday night. The centre back turned midfielder was presenting out the award for the top goal scorer in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the second tier of Malaysian football which was won by Kuala Lumpur FC’s Guilherme de Paula<br /><br />The partnership between to two sets of governing league bodies is still only in its infancy that started with a visit from Malaysian representatives to Spain last November, which now sees <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> also placing an official in Kuala Lumpur for the next couple of years</p>
