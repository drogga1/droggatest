  <p><b>[If you could bring any player from outside MLS into the league, who would you bring?]</b> One player? Wow, that’s difficult because there are a lot of good players who could come to MLS and help MLS. I will say my brother Jonathan.<br /><br />We don’t know. There’s interest on both sides, it’s been discussed, but as of today there’s no answer. He’s still a Villarreal player, so we’ll wait to see what happens. It’s been always my dream, and his dream, to play on the same team, and there’s a chance. Hopefully soon we can be together<br /><br />We’ve talked about it, and I know that he has a desire to play with me in LA some day. I know there’s interest from the <b>[Galaxy]</b> as well, but he’s a Villarreal player so there’s nothing concrete at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Giovani dos Santos said it was tough to describe exactly what he’d done differently this offseason]</b> I think I worked on everything. Physically, some things, muscles in my body I wouldn’t work on during the season. Things that get you ready physically. It’s tough to explain, but I’ve tried to do everything possible to come to my team and the national team as prepared as I possibly can be<br /><br />I don’t think anybody has their place safe in the national team in the world of football. In the end, it’s very clear that the coach makes the decision and we as professionals have to as well as possible on the field. It’s a World Cup year. Every Mexican player worldwide dreams of going to the World Cup. We have to do everything we can to draw the coach’s eye. In the national there are no friendly games. Tomorrow is an important game, the first of the year in a World Cup year so we’re hoping to do what we can to help our team in the match</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio’s master plan for 2018 begins Wednesday]</b> I think the numbers speak for themselves, about the way in the team plays and has fought in its matches. We agree that it’s a privileged generation and Osorio has come in to inject us with a different mentality, fighting against every team, playing at their level and today we feel more confident and that we can compete against anybody - and beat them.</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic is one of the best strikers in history]</b> I don’t know if it is going to happen but he’s a legend, one of the best strikers in history of soccer. So if he comes he is very welcome and for sure everyone would be very happy to have him in the team. It would be like a dream come true. I’ve been able to play with some of the best strikers in the world. I played with Robbie Keane, so to bring a total player like Zlatan would be huge for our attack.</p>

  <p><b>[Gio dos Santos seeing life in a different way in Los Angeles ahead of critical 2018 for Galaxy, Mexico]</b> I’m going to be honest, I love to be at home. I just trained, I came home and I like to be home with my family, be at home with my parents here and spend the day with them. I really like to watch movies, to read books. Really, I’m a very calm person in that respect.<br /><br />I think I’m in a stage of my life where where I see life in a different way, I enjoy it in a different way and I like to relax with the people who I want to enjoy spending time with<br /><br />I think we all, as professionals, knowing that it’s a World Cup year have this in our minds: to feel your best physically so when the moment arrives you can be at your top level. Personally, it’s a very important year at the club level as well because since I’ve been here I’ve wanted to win a title with this club and on the national team level, it could be my third World Cup, so I hope it’s a great year in all senses<br /><br />Obviously being a Galaxy player, we know the responsibility we have this year. Historically, the Galaxy are the most important team in this league and we know that every year the expectations for this club are the highest. This year, really, it’s to get the title. We know we have competition in the city now, and I think it’s extraordinary for the club and the league that there will be such an important rivalry in this city with a new team. They have a person I care about a lot in my friend Carlos Vela, so for me these games will be doubly important, and I’m ready for the game to be here so I’m able to enjoy it<br /><br />I’m in love with the city. I love Los Angeles. I’m thankful for all the support people have given me. I’m also much closer to my country, Mexico, and my family can come visit me much more often. I’m in love with the club, with the people who work within the club. It’s a family now. I really feel happy here<br /><br /><b>[On Pepsi’s Soccer Generations campaign]</b> For me, it’s a privilege. I’m excited to be part of a campaign for an iconic company on a global level like Pepsi is. There are going to be players I really like like Messi, Marcelo and Toni Kroos. I’m feel very happy and privileged to be part of this campaign</p>

I get up in the morning and I’m happy and that is what is important for me in the end. I greet my family, my brothers, my parents. Me being happy doesn’t have a price</p>
