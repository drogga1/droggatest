  <p><b>[The day <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> managed <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> despite having been sacked and replaced by <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>]</b> I think City fans genuinely wanted him to succeed but - especially with the takeover - you always had the impression he was a dead man walking<br /><br />Signing Robinho on that magnificent day in 2008 was probably an indication that <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> wasn’t going to be the manager to manage the type of players that the club was suggesting we wanted to buy and the club were probably waiting - I know that sounds horrible - for the opportunity to take advantage of that<br /><br />I think it’s logical that if you are one of the biggest football clubs in the world if you know you’ve a member of staff that you’re going to dispense the first thing you need to do is make sure you’ve got a replacement lined up but I think if we were going to sack him we should have done it before the game.<br /><br />If Khaldoon was running late, get on the phone to him. It’s not ideal either but I’d rather have Facetimed him or spoken to him on the phone than made him sit through that. It was so uncomfortable because how do you react? I did feel really sorry for him.<br /><br />I remember thinking this is not right. We haven’t dealt with this right and a little bit at the back of my mind was hoping this wasn’t a sign of things to come. Then actually it got a little bit worse at the press conference when Mancini arrived</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Parker has seen his club benefit from as many VAR calls as they have been left reeling by them over the past 18 months]</b> Even with VAR I thought nothing is going to be 100%, but I thought it would certainly improve the game and you would probably end up with teams getting decisions that were rightly there. Ninety minutes into the season, people thought: ‘What is this going to be like?’. It just doesn’t seem right to me that you can be at the game and you’re not being informed at all about what’s going on. You may not have the full process of what the referee or the Stockley Park people are going into. But I think that once the decision has been made, you would play back the incident and say:’ The referee does not think that’s a penalty, the referee does think <b>[the foul was]</b> outside <b>[the penalty area]</b>’, or whatever</p>
