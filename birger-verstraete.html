  <p><b>[Koln midfielder Verstraete: It’s ‘bizarre’ we are still training after three positive Covid-19 tests]</b> What the club communicated, that nobody has come into contact with the players is correct, in the literal sense of the word, that is. But the physiotherapist is the man who treated me and other players for weeks. And I formed a duo in the gym on Thursday with one of the two players in question. So to say we did not come into contact with them at all is not entirely correct<br /><br />I hope it stays with three people, but I also keep in mind that the virus has spread<br /><br />We aren’t quarantined for the time being, and that’s a bit bizarre. At the moment football is not the most important place for me, especially because it is getting so close now. I had previously seen images of intensive care. And now it appears that the virus is also close to us. So it’s bit strange that everything just keeps going<br /><br />I think it would be naive of myself and others to say that football should be resumed as soon as possible. The virus once again shows that you have to take it seriously. It is not up to me to decide what to do with the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, but I can say that my head is not on football. The health of my family, girlfriend, everyone, actually, is paramount</p>

  <p><b>[Verstraete backtracks on criticism as Koln plan quarantine-like training camp]</b> I gave an interview about my personal concerns about my girlfriend potentially getting the virus. I expressed myself falsely in a few places, so that in the translation a misunderstanding has came about and I am sorry for that. Instead of giving an interview out of emotion, I should have contacted our doctor and had my questions answered. It was not my intention to blame the responsible authorities or Koln. I feel comfortable and in good hands with FC. I will continue to give my all in training … and I want to end the season in Cologne. My girlfriend, who belongs to the risk group because of a previous heart disease, will head home to Belgium and stay there for the time being</p>
