  <p><b>[Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mngqithi says the technical team is satisfied with Jeremy Brockie’s contribution so far]</b> We are very satisfied with what he has done. You must remember, it’s been a very short space of time he’s come in from a team that plays very differently from us, and that adaptation period doesn’t take a short period of time. I’m sure you know what he can do, and that is the reason why we have him.</p>
