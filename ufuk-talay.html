  <p><b>[Australian <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> question government over coronavirus concerns]</b> I don’t know <b>[who we will be playing]</b>. We will be flying into Sydney and going from there. There’s a possibility that we might stay there and play the remaining games in Australia and might have to continue to play the finals series in Australia as well. We’ll prepare and get ourselves ready like we’re going to be there forever and prepare like we’re going to come back the next day<br /><br /><b>[Phoenix attacking midfielder Ulises Davila has decided against returning to his native Mexico to be with his wife and newborn son]</b> At this stage Uli has decided not to go home and see the season out. We’re in discussions. It’s very tough. We had a plan in place but we can’t control what is happening around the world at the moment and we’ll just have to adapt to what’s in front of us. He wants to stay, he wants to see the season off and finish the best way possible. It was his decision solely. He’s just worried that if he goes and he comes back in a few weeks’ time and he has to go into quarantine again. He’s very comfortable with his wife being in Mexico with the baby because she’s got family over there and he’s got family over there as well</p>
