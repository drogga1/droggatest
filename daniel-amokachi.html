  <p><b>[No Okocha, no <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a> as Amokachi names <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">Mikel</a> greatest Nigerian player]</b> <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">Mikel</a> is the greatest player. He has won everything that a player can hope to; the Champions League, Europa, Afcon in 2013 and he also captained the national team. As a footballer, your laurels count and that will surely count for <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">Mikel</a> because nobody has won that much in Nigerian football</p>
