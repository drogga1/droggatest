  <p><b>[Sanjay Bhandari wants full teams to show solidarity against racism by following the example of <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a>]</b> I hope there will be a degree of leniency shown by the German authorities. I’m not sure how you can sanction <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a>. I don’t think he’s done anything wrong. He’s just taken a knee. I wonder if that’s the thing I would encourage if players want to protest. If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too - everyone. Every player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> celebration after the first game back where all the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee. Racism’s not about black players or brown fans. It’s about all of us. Racism corrodes society and we’re all hurt by it. Everyone should want to demonstrate their solidarity and disgust. I would like to encourage the players to protest if they want to but I would also like to encourage them to do it in a way that doesn’t expose them to unnecessary sanction. If they could do that by taking a knee, if every player did that, it would be quite a powerful message. If they could do that by taking a knee, if every player did that, it would be quite a powerful message</p>
