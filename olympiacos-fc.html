  <p><b>[Olympiacos have announced that Yaya Toure’s contract has been terminated with immediate affect after just five appearances]</b> Yaya is and remains an important member of the Olympiacos family, who has marked a central part of the history of the club. Olympiacos would like to thank him for everything he has offered to the Club. Yaya will remain deeply devoted to the club and wishes to Olympiacos lots of success. Yaya is leaving as a friend and the doors at Olympiacos will always be open for him. Our paths will surely cross again.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> issue statement after Olympiacos owner tests positive for coronavirus]</b> Our home match with Olympiacos in the Europa League was played on Thursday 27th February and none of our staff who came into contact with him on that matchday have reported any symptoms since. We continue to follow strict protocols with regard to coronavirus. We’re following the Government health guidelines and have additional procedures in place to protect our players and staff. This has included regular deep cleaning of areas used by players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> and our training centre</p>

  <p><b>[Olympiacos have now confirmed that their players and staff have been given a clean bill of health]</b> Olympiacos FC informs that after the required medical exams to which all the members of the football staff (players, coaching, medical and technical staff of the team), as well as all the board members and staff, were submitted, all the tests came out negative for the COVID-19 virus<br /><br />Following yesterday’s news that Olympiacos owner <a href="evangelos-marinakis.html">Evangelos Marinakis</a> has recently contracted Covid-19, we have been taking medical advice and tracing any individuals who had what the guidelines define as close contact with him at the game 13 days ago<br /><br />The medical advice we have received puts the risk of them developing Covid-19 at extremely low. However, we are strictly following the Government guidelines which recommend that anyone coming into close contact with someone with the virus should self-isolate at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact. As a result, the players are unavailable for tonight’s match against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has decided the game should be postponed</p>

  <p><b>[Olympiacos owner <a href="evangelos-marinakis.html">Evangelos Marinakis</a> had tested positive for the virus. <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> statement published on the club’s website read]</b> Our position is that the trip poses an unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times. Our concern is also for our opponents, whose players and staff have today been tested, and will now be expected to play their part in an important fixture, under the difficult and challenging circumstances of their owner suffering with the virus. There is also disappointment that the match will be played without home and away supporters, as that is part of what makes European competition so special, as well as the fact our fans have already contended with similar obstacles on our Europa League journey already this season. We believe that there are some things that are more important than football, and that the good health of our pack and the general public is one of them. However, we respect the decision of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and the integrity of the competition, and we will travel tomorrow to Greece to play the fixture. We hope that our request to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, and our acceptance of their decision, can act as the catalyst for them to consider alternative options moving forwards, as this will not be the last fixture to be affected by coronavirus</p>
