  <p>[Ajdin Hrustic savouring Groningen breakthrough] To be honest, I don’t want to stop. I would like to keep going but my body also needs rest. I’ve played quite a lot of games for the second team … a little break is also good. It seems so long but it’s only like a month since I made my debut and I even managed to get myself a goal, and it’s obviously great that the coach has got so much trust in me. So I’m just quite flattered to be honest.<br /><br />[Asked about the possibility of a shock call-up for next month’s World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia] I haven’t even thought about it, if I’m honest. I’m never surprised but it would be an honour to represent your country. It was a great experience [with the development squad]. We had a great connection from the first minute and I enjoyed my time there</p>

  <p>[Socceroos Ajdin Hrustic and Dylan McGowan were on cloud nine after making their international debuts in Australia’s 4-0 loss to Brazil] It’s great to make your debut against Brazil in my hometown where I was born. Disappointing to get away with that kind of result but I’m sure we’ll learn from this and take it as a positive away to Russia. I felt good. I was excited. There was no need to be nervous. It’s a friendly game. The boss just told me to do my thing. [Brazil] is a different kind of football style [to the Eredivisie] but you learn from every team. You learn something from every game positive and negative.</p>
