<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Stoke eased their relegation worries with a comfortable 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Birmingham]</b> I am disappointed with our response to the goals in the way they developed. If we are serious about what we want to do we can’t give those opportunities away. The atmosphere in the changing room is not delightful, there are players in there who care. They are bitterly disappointed in the way we conceded the goals and it is as you would expect. It is not about three points to stay up, that is not acceptable. We have been in this position too often and we do not want to go into the last game needing something</p>

  <p><b>[Lukas Jutkiewicz denied Charlton manager <a href="lee-bowyer.html">Lee Bowyer</a> a winning return to St Andrew’s as <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> grabbed a late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw]</b> I could not praise the players highly enough. We spoke about application and ability and the way they took on information, they displayed it. We had a chat and went back to basics and that’s what we did. Right from the kick-off I was very impressed with us in the first 20 minutes and we made it very uncomfortable for them</p>
