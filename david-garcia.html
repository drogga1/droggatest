  <p><b>[Osasuna vs <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Osasuna do not have the lofty ambitions of their guests but do believe that the timing of this fixture falls in their favour]</b> Obviously I think it is better that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez and <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a> are not available because they are the best they have; but you have to be aware of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s bench. The 11 they put out will be very good. I see us having a real chance to fight in this game. They will dominate, as usual, but we’ll try to get something with the encouragement of our fans</p>

  <p><b>[Former Espanyol left-back David Garcia had the honour of being the first man to mark <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and has declared that the Argentine wasn’t anything special on that day back in 2004]</b> We knew who he was, both me and the Espanyol youth players. We knew what <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had in their squad and that he was one to watch. We had seen him in some matches with the B squad and we knew, in part, what he was capable of. It was normal <b>[marking <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> that day]</b>, he was not what he is now, despite his innate talent. Today he is confident and has grown a lot - nothing like what he was in that game. I don’t remember anything special about marking him, it was like defending against any other player<br /><br /><b>[Looking back at his early duel with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Garcia concedes he never thought the attacker would go on to become the superstar he is today]</b> I sensed that he would be a very good player but not what he has become. The truth is that at that time I did not think about what he was going to be. I thought that, like many boys from Espanyol or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​he was fulfilling the dream of debuting with his team being so young but on the pitch you don’t think about that</p>
