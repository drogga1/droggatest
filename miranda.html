  <p>[Miranda says Tuesday’s Brasil Global Tour clash with Germany in Berlin arrives at the perfect time for a Brazil side reborn under coach Tite] I think this is the ideal time to face them. We have that trust now and our heads are in the right place. It is inevitable there will be talk about 7-1, but we have to learn lessons from everything in life. Let’s remain quiet and focus on trying to play our game. Tite is spectacular in these types of situation.<br /><br />I get that feeling [that I should have played in 2014] because I was very well prepared but, at the same time, I accept that it was not meant to be. Things do not happen by chance. Today, I’m even more prepared and experienced, and I’m sure I can help the Selecao</p>

  <p>[Miranda says five-time world champions Brazil must renovate] Renewing the team is necessary. Since the World Cup in Russia, Tite is seeking to combine experience with new players so that the team can begin to prepare for the next cycle, with a view to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.<br /><br />The arrival of new, young players is very important. It’s key to find a good mix as the experienced players can help the new ones, and we have to maintain the high standard. I think, in view of all these arguments, that in the end Tite will make his decision and we hope it is for the better, regardless of age<br /><br />I work with a nutritionist, a physiologist, and today a player can still play at a high level at 38, 39-years-old, due to the evolution of football in all those areas. That is my goal<br /><br />Neymar is a leader. He has his own way of leading and I think it was a good choice. Neymar has a great responsibility and we have to share that responsibility in the leadership of the group. We respect him and we will all try to help him in the best way possible</p>
