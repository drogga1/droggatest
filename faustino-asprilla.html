  <p><b>[Ex-Newcastle United and Colombia forward Faustino Asprilla is doing his part to ease the strains of the coronavirus outbreak in his native country]</b> Here at home I have a whole load of condoms which I want you to help me use, because it is really difficult for me to use all of them. Filling up with kids and bringing them into the world with this virus is not on. So I am giving you a link through which you can get hold of these Tino condoms at a very reasonable price. I will let them go at more than half price so that you can have some protection at home: soap, washing your hands, and what could be better than condoms?</p>

It’s been a while since they have been winning trophies and they are thinking about strengthening the team for next season. They’ve got good players - like <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a>, who plays in a similar style to James, although he’s a little more dynamic and attacking but I think James could easily fit into that side<br /><br />James needs to go where he will play, a club where the coach has expressly asked for him and wants him in his team. Not where he will be an impulse signing, bought on a whim by the president. With his talent, he could play anywhere</p>

  <p><b>[Rodriguez’s compatriot Faustino Asprilla urged him to join the Gunners last month during a rather bleak assessment of another transfer rival]</b> James does not have to go to suffer at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolverhampton</a>, a team that always fights after relegation.

  <p><b>[Faustino Asprilla says <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> deserves more respect from <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>]</b> James isn’t irresponsible. He trains every day just like everyone else. The coaches say that all players are the same to give motivation to substitutes, but they have three or four who always play. At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, there are players who come from lower down and who come up. Don’t tell me that the top scorer of a World Cup is below Mariano or whoever in the pecking order. There’s a need for a little respect. James is patient, but I would tell <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> to ‘eat sh*t’</p>

  <p><b>[Faustino Asprilla says James made bad decisions; he should’ve stayed at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>]</b> It seemed very strange to me that James decided not to stay at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. These are the consequences of bad decisions. What is one’s happiness? The happiness of a footballer is playing. They valued him more there. Cities have lots to do with families and players’ decisions because, for example, lots of players would like to play for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but the city is not what they expect and they get bored. I went to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. Where could be stranger? Impossible. I didn’t get bored because I was happy where I was playing football. I’ve been in great cities, like <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, where the sun didn’t shine, where it snowed, then rained… a very strange thing<br /><br /><a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would be a good place for James.
