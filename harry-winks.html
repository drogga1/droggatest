  <p><b>[Winks has explained why the team are on such a good run of form]</b> Playing for Spurs is a dream come true every time I go out on the field. At the moment we have a very good team spirit, we just get on really well as a bunch of boys, we’ve just come back from a trip to Barcelona and we all respect each other. I always looked up to someone like Scott Parker when I was a youngster coming through, he was a top player, him and Luca Modric are both top players I really admire.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Winks says Tottenham will take the game to Manchester City when they face the league leaders at the Etihad Stadium]</b> We’re confident in our ability. We think we can go there and match them. Obviously it’s down to the manager the way we play, but we’ll go into the game the way we go into every game: positive and on the front foot. We’ll try to out-possess them and outplay them. We know what we’re like as a team, we know how good we can be, how good we are. It’s a good place to set a standard and make a marker and a point.<br /><br />There’s no point in going into a game and not thinking you’re going to win. We’re a positive team, we like to think we’re one of the top teams in the division. We have to go there and prove that. We’re confident at the moment, obviously on the back of two wins and we’ll go there with full confidence and try to win. It’d be nice to go there and get the win, first and foremost to get the three points. But to end their run would be nice as well, it’ll be a good incentive to try to get that as well.<br /><br />I know it’s going to be tough, I know they’re a good side and you have to respect them. There’s going to be times in the game when you have to adapt and play a bit differently and that’s down to the way the manager wants us to play. They’re a good side, they’re showing how good they are but so are we. We went there last year, performed well and got a good <b>[2-2]</b> draw. We’re going to go into the game confident on the back of two Premier League wins. Who knows?<br /><br />Obviously, from a neutral’s perspective, you can see they’re playing attractive football, doing very well, and you have to sometimes credit the opposition and say, ‘They’re a very good side’. We want to climb the table and as high as we want to be depends on City dropping points. And of course we want them to drop points because we want to win the league. But from a neutral’s perspective, you have to credit the way they are playing. It is frustrating obviously seeing the points gap between us. But there’s still a lot to play for, it’s a long season and you can never say never. Stranger things have happened in the Premier League, so you never know</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Winks hailed Lionel Messi as the greatest ever]</b> I did enjoy it. To play against him was an honour. The result takes away a lot of the enjoyment from the game, but in years to come, when I look back and say I played against - in my opinion - the greatest player to ever play football, it will be a proud moment. It’s so difficult to reflect on that right now because we’ve lost and, ultimately, that’s the most important thing. I’m gutted. The only way I can really describe <b>[facing him]</b> is he’s just completed football. The man just knows where everybody is. His weight of pass is just exceptional. He’s just special. But everyone who has played against him has said the same thing for years<br /><br />For me, it was special to play against a player like that. I learnt a lot from it. I’ll watch the game back and I’ll dissect my game. There were times when I gave the ball away sloppily, which wasn’t good enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks is keen to learn as much as he can from Wayne Rooney ahead of the striker’s England farewell]</b> I think some of the boys have probably played with him for England before but for me it is a bit surreal. When I was young, growing up, you think of Wayne Rooney as England and all of the stuff he has done for his club and country it is amazing. To be in and around him and to train with him, you see his quality and his professionalism and he is definitely someone to learn off. When you are in and around someone like Wayne Rooney you have to take as much experience from him as possible. He has won everything, done everything and he is a top, top player - when you think of England you think of Wayne Rooney.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Winks says he would rather play for the England senior side than for the Under-21s at the European Championships next summer]</b> The most experience you’re ever going to get is playing with the senior side. When you’re playing away to Spain and teams like that, that is the kind of experience you need to play more of, to understand how to deal with it. You can argue for and against for both. Going away with the Under-21s is massive and winning the competition is something you’d like to be involved in. But, ultimately, the main goal is to play for the senior side.<br /><br /><b>[Midfielder is not concerned about a decision being made with any immediacy]</b> I haven’t spoken to him <b>[Pochettino]</b> about it yet. I expect that will happen towards the end of the season. After being involved in the Spain win, I just want more of it</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s Harry Winks says he modelled his playing style on Barcelona legends Andres Iniesta and Xavi]</b> I’ve never been blessed with height, strength and power so I’ve had to learn how to play differently from a young age. My game was all based on technique and when I look at players like Xavi and Iniesta they were always players I modelled myself on. We’ve always had a philosophy at Spurs to play out from the back, to play with style, to play out from the back and that’s the way I’ve always been brought up and to come into the first team is no different. The manager always expects us to play out or at least try. We never compromise our principles, even <b>[against]</b> Barcelona away, it was a difficult test because they are known for their possession. We’ve all come through the same way through the club, you get drilled and coached into the academy. You learn how to play for Tottenham, what it means to play for Spurs and you can bring those habits in to the first team. When you have players who are familiar with it then there’s no better way. I’m just a Tottenham fan living the dream, basically. To play for Tottenham it was always an absolute dream to have all the kits. Like the kids here today, they dream of playing for Spurs and I’m exactly the same. Now to be playing in the first team feels that bit more special because the club is close to my heart and they are the team I’ve been watching since I was a little boy<br /><br />When we won the League Cup it was great, I was actually there at Wembley with my dad, we were in the top tier and we were celebrating like mad when that <b>[extra-time goal]</b> went in. It was incredible. Just going to games from a young age with my dad, watching Tottenham as often as I could, celebrating in my front room, singing and enjoying it, so many fond memories from when I was a kid. The team is coming of age. There’s a lot of talk about us needing to win a trophy and, of course, no-one wants to win a trophy more than anyone in the team. But our main priority is to just try and improve every season, which we are doing, and hopefully a trophy will come at the end of that as a reward for all the hard work. We work really hard, we are improving and hopefully we can come away with some silverware. We’re in a strong position in the league, we’re well placed but we’ve also won a lot of games playing scruffy as well when we’ve not played so well. That’s probably what we’ve lacked in he last couple of seasons and yet we’ve ground out results, like against Burnley which was an important win and ultimately all that matters is the three points. If we can do it with style and we can do it in a great way then fantastic. But if not, then it’s important to get wins when sometimes it’s difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks believes that Mauricio Pochettino’s side have the ability to win the Premier League]</b> We believe we’re good enough to win the league, we’ve shown on many occasions that we are. I think there’s been a couple of games here and there that we probably should have won. Watford away and probably Wolves at home are two games that were key for us that we should have won but we didn’t. There’s still a long way to go for the rest of the season, there’s a lot of big games to try and win. We’re hoping that results go our way from other teams as well. You know, we don’t stop believing so hopefully things can go well for us in the last few games of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Winks admits the prospect of starting the Champions League final for his boyhood club ‘feels crazy to say’]</b> It is my club. I’ve known the club since I was five years old. It’s the only club I’ve ever played for. To be part of a Champions League final with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - it actually feels crazy to say it. It hasn’t really sunk in. To have been a part of the team, to have played as many games as I have done in the Champions League, and to be part of this amazing side and this incredible era for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is a true privilege. I am humbled to have the opportunity to do that, and if we can go all the way then we’ll make history and it will be fantastic.<br /><br />To be part of a team that has got to the Champions League final with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is something, honestly, I would never have dreamt of doing. But we’ve worked a lot in the last couple of weeks in dealing with the emotion of it all. Not getting carried away with it. (We’re) just treating it like any other game - but at the same point respecting the fact that it’s a Champions League final. It’s a positive vibe in the camp at the moment, everyone’s got a really good togetherness. I’ve seen what the manager has done to the club and how far he has taken everyone. Not only as players, but as people. The club is only going to go one way in my opinion, and that’s even higher and better</p>

Staying in is the hardest. It’s fantastic to get there but staying there is tough with so many top-quality players at the club, all wanting to start.</p>

They do incredibly well to improve us as players, and they have integrated youth players like me into the team. There is a special bond between the coach and the players.

In the last six years we have come such a long way, we have become a title-challenging side. But we haven’t shown it this season, we have only shown it in parts. In certain games, we have played really well but for the majority of this season, we haven’t shown what we are about. It’s important we look back on it and reflect, realise it’s not been good enough, no excuses. The only way we can put it right is back in training and the next match</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Winks says an honest conversation with manager <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> prompted him to up his work rate]</b> I had an honest chat with the manager and he told me what he believed I needed to do. It was just an honest conversation, which I respect massively. It started with training. I just think my whole level and just the intensity as well, which I said to the manager that I agree. Since we had that conversation things have improved and I have been playing more and it is important that I keep those levels and intensity because I want to stay in the team. Over the last few years I have realised what pains I can play with and which I need to be a little more pragmatic about. It’s something I’ve got used to now. I am sure every footballer would say the same<br /><br />He appreciates what everyone brings to the team and what their strengths are. He prefers defensive shape and being organised. That is something we needed to improve on anyway because we were shopping too many goals. Defensively, my role is a lot more important now. I needed to improve on that. I think defensively I have started to improve under the new manager. He has said it many times, he wants us to keep the ball, he wants us to create chances, and wants us to build from the back when it is the right time. We are still in the early phases of working out what the strategy is and what the tactics are<br /><br />Everybody always talks about players like <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> or <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>. People like <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a> get a lot of recognition after they retire and they are more players’ players as such. Every team needs goalscorers, needs attacking players, needs players who can sweep up the ball, but every team needs that someone who can be that link between both defence and attack.<br /><br />If you look at the greatest teams who have played they have always that sort of player. I think in England especially there is always an impetus to look straight for the attack-minded players, to look at the goalscorers and the people who get the assists.<br /><br />I think it is important to look back not just at the midfielders but the defensive and look at footballers in a different way. When we score it’s who has affected the game that way. But when we break the game down and look in depth and look at the reason why it has happened I think that is overlooked a bit slightly</p>

We were in control in the first half and it didn’t look like it was going to go any other way than us winning. It’s probably one of the best performances as a team we’ve had this season.
