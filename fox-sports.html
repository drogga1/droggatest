  <p><b>[Fox Sports says its passion for 2018 World Cup unchanged despite USA elimination]</b> Last night’s World Cup qualifying results do not change Fox Sports’ passion for the world’s biggest sporting event. While the U.S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.<br /><br />The World Cup is the greatest sporting event on earth that changes the world for one month every four years, and Fox Sports remains steadfast in our commitment of bringing the games to America for the first time in 2018 and will continue to support the U.S. Soccer Federation as they look ahead to the 2022 World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Financial analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group estimates a negative impact for Fox in the low tens of millions]</b> Reports indicating a $10 million to $20 million negative impact for Fox from the U.S. team’s failure to qualify seem correct and represent a negligible amount for the network.<br /><br />Arguably the challenging time zone <b>[with the 2018 tournament hosted in Russia]</b> will prove to cause a more significant factor depressing viewing when comparing 2018 vs. 2014</p>

  <p><b>[Fox Sports is smiling bravely, but no amount of spin by the network can hide the damage caused by the U.S. men’s soccer team’s dramatic crash and burn out of the 2018 FIFA World Cup]</b> While the U.S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.
