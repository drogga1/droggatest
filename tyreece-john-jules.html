  <p><b>[Teenagers Tyreece John-Jules and Xavier Amaechi are wanted across Europe]</b> It was an amazing feeling. I’ve been looking forward to this moment all my life, so I’m just happy that it’s actually come off. It’s been an amazing experience. It’s been about getting to know the players. The game’s a lot quicker than under-23s football though and it’s going to improve me as a player. It’s about taking it all in and trying to go again. Hopefully I’ll get anther chance</p>

  <p><b>[John-Jules has scored six goals in 13 appearances during the 2019-20 campaign while also providing two assists, adding to the 16 goals he scored across youth levels last season]</b> I’ve been trying to learn from them on and off the pitch. They’ve just told me to be positive, to be confident when I’m on the ball, especially with the first team. I’ve got to show what I can do and keep going. I can learn so much from them.<br /><br />It’s always been a dream come true to play at this club. As always, I’ve been working hard, so I think I deserve this new contract. I’m just trying to push on now to impress the manager. I need to keep working hard, playing for the first team and when I get my chance, try to take it as well as possible</p>
