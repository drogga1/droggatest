  <p><b>[The effectiveness of American substitutes Carli Lloyd, <a href="christen-press.html">Christen Press</a> and Mallory Pugh overwhelmed the Mexicans in an eventual 3-0 triumph. Dunn created two of the U.S. team’s best chances in the first half, forcing a pair of highlight-reel saves by Mexico goalkeeper Santiago]</b> I’ve always been told to put my own twist on the outside back role. I just make it my own, and I think for me it’s just about trying to impact the game from that position and getting myself in pockets and being able to create whatever I can to help the team succeed in the attacking role.<br /><br />Do I love defending? That’s very not easy question to answer. No, of course I don’t. I’m an attacking-minded player, but I know that that is my role on this team and I fall in love with being the best that I can be. If that means they need me to be an outside back that’s going to limit chances 1-v-1 defending, then of course I’m in love with the grind and always just being at my best every day</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Dunn does not believe that the size of the goal and pitch should be made smaller for the women’s game. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes sparked discussion with a recent column in The Times saying that the dimensions should be altered for women’s football]</b> I know Emma Hayes really well, played under her at Chelsea. Those are obviously her opinions and I personally don’t agree with it. You guys have seen the Chilean goalkeeper do some incredible things against us - dang it! She had an amazing game and for anyone to think that our goals should be smaller or our field should be smaller in any way, I personally don’t agree. For a goalkeeper to be able to compete at that level and save as many saves as she can against us, I think it’s incredible and that’s just a testament that the goals are exactly the size they need to be, the pitch is the size that it needs to be</p>

  <p><b>[Dunn, one of the USWNT’s four players on their Women’s World Cup 2019 roster with an ethnic minority background, commented on diversity in June]</b> I am seeing so much more diversity and I think that’s really all I hope for, year-in, year-out. It’s always progressing in the right direction and especially being a woman of color I always root so much for the black girls that are doing well and I’m always rooting for diversity in this sport continuing to grow. I’ve been seeing it so I’m quite happy with it</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Dunn saved her best performance in her adopted position as left-back]</b> It is challenging but me stepping into a new position on the field, I try not to overthink. I just think of myself as a footballer. I’m just playing and trying to impact the game from a different angle of the field is what I always say</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Dunn on Racism]</b> Until we all acknowledge what is going on in the world, we really are going to be on this uphill battle for a very long time. If anyone on my team had a question, I hope that they would come up to me and ask. I would love to talk about anything so that I can help them see the world and understand what it is going on. We learn at a young age to include everybody, and even though we don’t look the same or act the same or come from different backgrounds, it’s so important to have a collective group, and an understanding that we’re all different</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Dunn said she felt ‘joy’ when teammate <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Megan Rapinoe</a> decided to kneel in protest at racism and police brutality, but admitted that she didn’t feel comfortable doing so herself as she feared for her future]</b> I just remember our conversation where she came up to me and said, ‘Crys, I’m thinking of kneeling’. and I remember being just filled with so much joy for her wanting to fight a cause that, in my opinion at that time was like, ‘You have nothing to do with this’. That was ignorant on my part just thinking that off the bat. I was just so moved that she wanted to fight for this cause. I also remember telling her that I had to stand because I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’m scared for my job. I’m scared that it’s going to look differently if a black girl on the team kneels and I don’t know. I just had really hard conversations with her, how I was internally conflicted and saw the way U.S. Soccer responded and treated Megan. To me, I’m thinking they kept her out of some games, kept her out of camp, and yeah that was mad, but for me, I was thinking that they could rip up my contract</p>
