  <p><b>[Man City youngster Brahim Diaz ‘dribbles like Messi’. Edward Francis said]</b> He is a type of player who can win matches for us. He is strong with his left and right foot, he is definitely a big player for us. If we can keep him fit, he can help us go all the way this year. In the Premier League we can compare him with Eden Hazard, but he is a bit like Messi in the way he dribbles. It’s good to have a player like him in the team. He is also a bit like David Silva.<br /><br />It was a good performance for us, good to get the three points away from home. Obviously it’s tough to play against Feyenoord. At the end of the day only the three points matter. I definitely think we can win the Youth League. With a result like this, it shows that we can get three points even if we don’t play at our best. I think we’ve got a very good chance to go all the way this year</p>

  <p><b>[Brahim Diaz, Manchester City’s NxGn starlet eyed by Real Madrid]</b> I will stay - it is a luxury to learn from the best, and live alongside them. I want to continue my development, be a success at City and win titles. I only know that I am still with City, the rest is just rumours. I am totally focused on this team. I just want to play as much as I can and keep learning. I would like to play more minutes - I am ambitious and want to stay at the club for a long time.</p>

It is the perfect Three Kings gift. My only three options that I wanted were to play for Real Madrid, to play for Real Madrid or to play for Real Madrid. I have dreamt of playing for this club since I was a boy.</p>

  <p><b>[Brahim Diaz had earlier thanked the City supporters for their backing on his few first-team opportunities]</b> I close a chapter of my life and I say goodbye to Manchester City, the club where I have grown. Thank you to all the managers in the club, from the academy to the first team, for believing in me because they taught me not only to be a better player, but a better person.<br /><br />Thank you to all the backroom staff and the medical services. Thank you to everyone involved in the offices working to make this club improve every day. Thank you to my teammates. And thank you, of course, to every single Manchester City supporter. I will never forget having my name chanted from the stands the night we beat Fulham in the League Cup. I came here being a kid and now I am a professional footballer.</p>

  <p><b>[Brahim Diaz plans to fight for starting berth under Zidane]</b> I want to stay at Real Madrid. We’ll see what happens.<br /><br />It was a nice goal, but it was not worth it because the result was not from our side. We played well at the start, but it was complicated with one less in a field like this. You can talk about many players. There is a very high level. We are happy, but with the expulsion it was difficult. We fought until the end</p>
