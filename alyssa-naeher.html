  <p><b>[There was plenty of focus on Alyssa Naeher heading into the World Cup but in her team’s first two games in France, the goalkeeper had almost nothing to do]</b> Every game presents different challenges. Sometimes you see the ball once, sometimes you see the ball 100 times and the challenge is staying focused for all 90 minutes regardless.<br /><br />To come away from the group stage with three shutouts as a team defensively I’m very proud of that. It’s a goal that we have going into every game</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher has taken notice of the shift in enforcement of VAR]</b> They’re calling it very tight. I guess we didn’t really know coming into the tournament how tight they were going to call it, and I think the last few games have obviously shown what they can and will call.<br /><br /><b>[Naeher says she’s gone back and reviewed film of her penalty-stopping technique]</b> I don’t think as of now that I have an issue with it. It’s something to keep in the back of my mind but not focus on</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher was partially at fault on Spain’s opener as she played <a href="becky-sauerbrunn.html">Becky Sauerbrunn</a> into a tight spot from which she gave the ball away]</b> I just need to make a smarter decision and not play it into a pressure pocket. It would have probably been better just to put the it up the field a little bit more.</p>

  <p><b>[Spain used selective pressing to harass the American goalkeeper and her back line, picking and choosing when to sit back and when to pounce. That strategy paid off to perfection in the ninth minute, as Lucia Garcia took the ball off <a href="becky-sauerbrunn.html">Sauerbrunn</a> after Naeher played her an unwise pass into a tight spot]</b> I just need to make a smarter decision and not play it into a pressure pocket</p>

  <p><b>[Women’s World Cup recap - U.S. beats France 2-1 on two <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Megan Rapinoe</a> goals]</b> To me a big tackle is as important and kind of brings energy <b>[of]</b> a great goal. Because that’s not easy and you’re putting your body on the line. It’s necessary and it’s important. You see the same sliding from the first minute to the 90th minute. That’s a testament to their heart, their energy, their passion and their willingness to put whatever they have to on the line to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Naeher was especially pleased by Eugenie Le Sommer’s performance after the pair each made a mistake on Spain’s goal in the round of 16]</b> I had no doubt she was going to come back even stronger from that. She proved that tonight, she’s making big-time stops and big-time tackles and we know exactly what we’re going to get from her. She’s our leader back there</p>

  <p><b>[USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher says, her team’s winning mentality was not invented but rather inherited]</b> That is the root of the U.S. women’s national team from way back to the teams from 20 years ago. That’s always been the U.S. mentality and that’s something that every veteran player has instilled in all the new players as we’ve come in. It’s now our job to carry that through.<br /><br /><b>[Naeher said of Phil Neville]</b> They have a manager who has instilled that belief in them and you can see that energy and that passion when you watch them play</p>

  <p><b>[Alyssa Naeher has been criticized. She has been questioned. She has been compared unfavorably to her predecessors. But on Tuesday night, Alyssa Naeher became a U.S. women’s national team hero. The U.S. goalkeeper made a massive fingertip save in the first half to deny a long-range strike from <a href="keira-walsh.html">Keira Walsh</a> in what was her best moment of the World Cup thus far]</b> I don’t really remember to be honest. I just tried to let instincts take over at that point and just try to get a good jump on it, get a good read and hope to make a save.<br /><br /><b>[Naeher has stayed even-keeled, trying to avoid getting caught up in comparisons with Hope Solo]</b> I’ve said from the beginning that I just try to be me. My goal every day is being a better person and a better player than I was yesterday. To me it’s not about comparisons, it’s about how I can help this team win here in 2019</p>
