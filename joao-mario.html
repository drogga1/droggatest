  <p><b>[Joao Mario leaves <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> for Lokomotiv Moscow as Sanchez transfer looms]</b> I’m very happy to join Lokomotiv. I know this is a big club. The team has a lot of experienced players. I asked Manuel Fernandes and <a href="eder.html">Eder</a> about the team when we played for the Portuguese national team. I spoke to <a href="eder.html">Eder</a> before this transfer. He told me Lokomotiv is a good team with a wonderful atmosphere. Playing in the Champions League is also an important factor</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Mario says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would’ve been better fit for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> star Joao Felix]</b> Atletico are one of those teams that, seen from the outside, is very well worked out, as if it were an Italian team playing in Spain. Of course, moving from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, which plays 80% of the game in an organised attack, to Atletico, and with even more pressure due to the price, is not easy in terms of adaptation. Being, for example, at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​of course the pressure would be greater but the style of play would be more suitable<br /><br />The first time I trained with him I noticed him right away; there are players who I really like to watch play and <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> is one of them. The value of the transfer that is paid for a player does not weigh on us during the game. You try to remove yourself as much as possible from that factor, but obviously you know the investment that was made and you want to repay it, so it ends up influencing in some way. In the case of <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>, it is natural to talk about weight <b>[of expectation]</b>, but if you buy a player for that amount when he is 19, you cannot expect the boy to be the salvation of all the problems<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> Ronaldo]</b> Playing with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is very stimulating. He makes you try to be better at all times and makes you think ‘if <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, at 35 years old and having won everything, still wants to be better, why shouldn’t I try to always improve?’</p>
