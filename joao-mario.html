  <p><b>[An ambitious Inter had to pay a big sum to beat Chelsea and Liverpool to Joao Mario. But after a bright debut in Serie A, his form dipped as the Nerazzurri struggled under Frank de Boer]</b> Serie A is very difficult from a tactical point of view. I was not expecting Italian football to be so aggressive. In training, I tried to improve physically because there is so many challenges in the match. I’m still young and try to improve every day. I feel I’ve developed since the Euros because I’m playing in a very competitive league, a higher level than the Portuguese league and this has helped me become more complete.</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Mario talks up Milan move for Renato Sanches, but to AC rather than Inter]</b> We spoke after Thursday’s game <b>[between Inter and Bayern Munich in Singapore]</b>. He is young and strong, so I understand that he wants to play consistently and there is a lot of competition for places at Bayern. I told him that if he goes to Milan, he’ll find a great club and I’d have another friend in the city.<br /><br />If we want to be competitive, then we can’t think like that. We need to take on the best, just as we did against Bayern and Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham United have completed the loan signing of Inter midfielder Joao Mario]</b> I am really happy to be here. It’s a really amazing experience to join this amazing team and I am just glad to be here. It was a fast move. I have spoken with everyone around the team and, for me, it is exciting to play in the Premier League. I spoke with the coach and for me, I am really happy to be training for an amazing coach, also<br /><br /><b>[Mario joins countryman Jose Fonte at West Ham]</b> Jose explained to me a little more about the club and also the song we have, I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, and that, of course, it was really important for me to join West Ham! It’s a really historic club with an amazing stadium and amazing players. I am just trying to know a little bit more about the club every day and now I have some time to know more</p>

  <p><b>[The World Cup’s VAR system]</b> This is difficult with VAR. There were a lot of interruptions, a lot of stops, but we are here to play. We gave our best and that is the most important thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Mario leaves <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> for Lokomotiv Moscow as Sanchez transfer looms]</b> I’m very happy to join Lokomotiv. I know this is a big club. The team has a lot of experienced players. I asked Manuel Fernandes and <a href="eder.html">Eder</a> about the team when we played for the Portuguese national team. I spoke to <a href="eder.html">Eder</a> before this transfer. He told me Lokomotiv is a good team with a wonderful atmosphere. Playing in the Champions League is also an important factor</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Mario says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would’ve been better fit for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> star <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>]</b> Atletico are one of those teams that, seen from the outside, is very well worked out, as if it were an Italian team playing in Spain. Of course, moving from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, which plays 80% of the game in an organised attack, to Atletico, and with even more pressure due to the price, is not easy in terms of adaptation. Being, for example, at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​of course the pressure would be greater but the style of play would be more suitable<br /><br />The first time I trained with him I noticed him right away; there are players who I really like to watch play and <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> is one of them. The value of the transfer that is paid for a player does not weigh on us during the game. You try to remove yourself as much as possible from that factor, but obviously you know the investment that was made and you want to repay it, so it ends up influencing in some way. In the case of <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>, it is natural to talk about weight <b>[of expectation]</b>, but if you buy a player for that amount when he is 19, you cannot expect the boy to be the salvation of all the problems<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> Playing with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is very stimulating. He makes you try to be better at all times and makes you think ‘if <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, at 35 years old and having won everything, still wants to be better, why shouldn’t I try to always improve?’</p>
