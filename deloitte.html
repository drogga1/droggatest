  <p><b>[PLC’s meetings with financial services company Deloitte carried on for a second day on Thursday at the UAE Football Association offices. Paul Rawnsley said]</b> We are happy with the collaboration with the PLC in this club development project. It is an indication of the PLC’s keenness to develop its competitions. We are a global company, working with various sport sectors across the world. In the past 20 years we worked with around 50 sporting establishments and leagues in 40 countries to help leagues and clubs develop sporting competitions.<br /><br />Our current project with the PLC is not something new for us, we have done the same before in multiple countries, so we are trying to offer our expertise in this area by working with the PLC and football companies to benefit from the best practices. What is available somewhere else may not necessarily be applicable here in the UAE, therefore, we will be working with the PLC to develop a mechanism to be implemented in the future to achieve financial sustainability for clubs, regulate spending, minimise reliance on government support, assist clubs in increasing their revenues and balancing revenues with expenditure</p>

  <p><b>[Fellow Deloitte consultant Adam Bull believes that the mammoth television deal signed with BT Sport would further increase clubs’ spending power over the coming years]</b> We have already seen to some extent the impact of the current broadcast rights deal, with clubs’ combined transfer expenditure over the course of the 2016/17 season reaching almost £1.4 billion - eclipsing the previous record set in 2015/16 by one-third and far exceeding any other league in world football.</p>

  <p><b>[Deloitte is optimistic that Milan can recover even if they are not in Europe next season]</b> AC Milan has got its financial challenges but it’s still a very big brand. It’s been damaged slightly in recent years given its on-pitch performance. But in 2016-17 they weren’t appearing in UEFA competition and they still generated 190-odd million worth of revenues. Could there be financial reorganisations, improvements and rationalisations given the revenues are stagnant and the cost base increasing? Maybe. Could it go as far as Parma and Fiorentina, I don’t think so but it’s hard to predict. Well-established brand will always find people out there to help the club if they ever got to that position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[AC Milan have been banned from taking up their place in the Europa League next season]</b> Serie A’s existing broadcast deal is in place up to and including 2020-21 and so revenue growth will depend on improved commercial and matchday performance on a club-by-club basis. Unfortunately, the picture continues to look bleak for Italian clubs in the Money League.</p>

  <p><b>[European football is that influential for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clubs, given how far they have fallen behind their Spanish and English rivals in terms of commercial revenue and the value of TV rights deals]</b> The latest domestic broadcast rights sales process delivered an increase of just three per cent for the three-year cycle that commenced with Sky Italia and DAZN in 2018-19. Despite the commencement of a new international rights cycle, delivering an increase of 81% on the previous reported minimum guarantees, distributions to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clubs will see limited growth until at least the next cycle beginning in 2021/22. Therefore, further revenue increases for Italian clubs will depend on a club’s ability to deliver growth in matchday and commercial revenue streams, as well as success in <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competitions.</p>
