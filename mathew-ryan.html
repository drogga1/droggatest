  <p><b>[Brighton and Hove Albion keeper Mat Ryan has joked about his pleasure at seeing Eden Hazard seal a move away from the Premier League]</b> I think from the four times I’ve faced him I haven’t saved a shot from him yet. It’s either been blocked, he’s hit the shot off target or he’s scored a goal. It’s a bit of an annoying fact so thank god he’s p*ssed off somewhere else. I put in a nice word to <b>[Real Madrid]</b> for him. I would love to have the opportunity to face him again and stop him - that’s my motivation<br /><br /><b>[The Socceroos shot-stopper is adamant the competition is exactly what the green and gold need to improve under <a href="graham-arnold.html">Graham Arnold</a>]</b> Going into a tournament like that with the quality of opposition that we’re going to be facing and the experience it’s all going to give us is going to be phenomenal for us moving forward as a nation. The more games we can get of that higher quality, common sense tells you, the better we’re going to get, the better we’re going to progress. So I’ve got no doubt that tournament is going to be of massive importance for our growth as a footballing nation and a footballing team and footballing individuals</p>

Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I would be out here representing Australia, having been a young fan that night</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton and Hove Albion and Australia goalkeeper Maty Ryan donates money to help for the Australian bushfires emergency fund]</b> In light of the devastation caused by the bushfires back home, I’m donating 500 Australian dollars for every registered save by all premier league goalkeepers across every @premierleague fixture for this weekend. I’ve chosen to donate to the @wireswildliferescue emergency fund. Thank you to all for your support thus far and as a nation we really do appreciate your gratitude and generosity. However there continues to be homes lost, lives of both people and animals lost or in danger, along with whole communities, businesses and more. I hope we can continue in the same manor and continue to encourage and influence people into raising money for those affected. Other places you’re able to donate can be found in the links in their bios on Instagram or visiting their official webpages. Fingers crossed relief is on its way</p>
