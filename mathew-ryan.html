  <p><b>[Socceroos gloveman Mat Ryan has revealed reports of coach Ange Postecoglou’s imminent departure caught him by surprise]</b> Ange Postecoglou didn’t say anything to us after the game against Syria on Tuesday night about walking away from the Socceroos coaching job. When the report dropped on Wednesday that he could be stepping down from the job after the Honduras games, it caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Personally, I’d love Ange to be with us all the way to Russia, assuming we get past Honduras. I’m still thinking he’s going to be there. If Ange or David Gallop tell the players something different, then I’ll know, but otherwise I don’t think we can start thinking about ‘what’s next’.<br /><br />Ange has been with us going back to the last World Cup. I find it hard to imagine that if we get through to next year’s World Cup someone in his position would want to leave the team knowing we’ve qualified. Until we know for sure, I’ll just keep doing what I do.<br /><br />Criticism and praise come and go in football and I don’t pay too much attention to any of that, but Ange has copped a lot of criticism about our tactics and playing style. In my opinion, that’s been unfair. I’ve always loved Ange’s approach, the way he doesn’t see Australia as an underdog and how he asks the question, ‘Why can’t Australia do great things in the football world?’ I agree with him. That’s how you’ve got to be. That’s the right attitude.<br /><br />People criticised us when we went to three at the back during our World Cup qualifying campaign. They’re wrong. It’s part of football adjusting to team tactics and obviously a coach requires the team to be adaptable. The style we’re playing is designed not just to get us to the World Cup, but to get there and make some noise and be competitive at that level. I’ve got full faith in what Ange does and the direction he has taken for us as the national coach</p>

  <p><b>[Is Australia’s Mat Ryan the Premier League’s most underrated goalkeeper?]</b> Having been successful against a few of these <b>[French]</b> guys in the league, it gives me enormous belief that we can be successful whenever we face <b>[France]</b> and that’s this Saturday. There is tremendous belief in our squad that we can go there and beat them. They’re great players, they’re in their national team and their clubs for that reason. We have to be well prepared and find the balance of respecting them but not over-respecting them. The biggest thing I found out this year is that everyone I’ve come up against, they’re just human. We’ll be put under pressure and <b>[there]</b> may be struggling circumstances, maybe the same thing can happen to them if you apply it in the right areas at the right times.</p>

  <p><b>[Mat Ryan’s revelation on controversial France penalty against Socceroos]</b> Speaking to Josh afterwards he said he touched the ball himself, and I don’t think he’s a liar or anything like that. On the replays I have seen it didn’t look conclusive. I feel hard done by. I feel like we were beaten by a better team and almost by technology a little bit. I don’t want to cause more controversy or anything like that and I’m not here to make excuses, but there’s a lot of grey areas nowadays in that area of the game.<br /><br />Not here to make excuses. Nothing but proud of our team today and our performance. We can take enormous confidence from today’s performance</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos goalkeeper Mat Ryan couldn’t hide his disappointment with the VAR’s intervention post-game]</b> I feel hard done by. I feel like we were beaten by a better team and almost by technology a little bit. On the replays I have seen it didn’t look conclusive. You hear that technology was brought in to take out clear-cut errors and all this in the game but that’s the grey area. What’s a clear-cut error and what’s not? What’s conclusive and what’s not? I’m looking for a better explanation of it I guess now but I don’t want to take anything away from the game and the beautiful game that it is and what we’ve done today</p>

  <p><b>[Mat Ryan responds to shock Manchester United rumours]</b> Rumours float around all the time. If I’d actually played for every team I’d been linked with through the years, I would have represented Real Madrid, Liverpool and quite a few others by now! It’s not something I think about, although it’s hard to ignore it completely when all your family and friends are messaging you to see whether it’s true. All I’ll say is this: I love doing what I’m doing and where I’m doing it.</p>

  <p><b>[Australian keeper Mat Ryan also has one eye on having a big say on who claims the title]</b> At the moment, I’m an onlooker to the race but well aware and excited that perhaps Brighton can influence the drama of it all on the final day against City. It’s an exciting prospect to have them as the last game. Any time you come up against a big team, you want to make the memory as sweet as possible by being successful against them. There are three games to go but if it comes down to the last day again, we know we’ll have every Liverpool fan in the world in our corner.<br /><br />The thought of relegation is obviously a scary one but at the same time I don’t give it too much thought because I’m focusing my time and attention in order to help us be safe and secure our premiership football again for next season. Fingers crossed come that last game, the pressure of relegation is no longer there and we can go out and enjoy the occasion. I choose to have a positive outlook and I always visualise positive things and us being successful</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton and Hove Albion keeper Mat Ryan has joked about his pleasure at seeing <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> seal a move away from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I think from the four times I’ve faced him I haven’t saved a shot from him yet. It’s either been blocked, he’s hit the shot off target or he’s scored a goal. It’s a bit of an annoying fact so thank god he’s pissed off somewhere else. I put in a nice word to <b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> for him. I would love to have the opportunity to face him again and stop him - that’s my motivation<br /><br /><b>[The Socceroos shot-stopper is adamant the competition is exactly what the green and gold need to improve under <a href="graham-arnold.html">Graham Arnold</a>]</b> Going into a tournament like that with the quality of opposition that we’re going to be facing and the experience it’s all going to give us is going to be phenomenal for us moving forward as a nation. The more games we can get of that higher quality, common sense tells you, the better we’re going to get, the better we’re going to progress. So I’ve got no doubt that tournament is going to be of massive importance for our growth as a footballing nation and a footballing team and footballing individuals</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton and Hove Albion and Australia goalkeeper Maty Ryan donates money to help for the Australian bushfires emergency fund]</b> In light of the devastation caused by the bushfires back home, I’m donating 500 Australian dollars for every registered save by all premier league goalkeepers across every @premierleague fixture for this weekend. I’ve chosen to donate to the @wireswildliferescue emergency fund. Thank you to all for your support thus far and as a nation we really do appreciate your gratitude and generosity. However there continues to be homes lost, lives of both people and animals lost or in danger, along with whole communities, businesses and more. I hope we can continue in the same manor and continue to encourage and influence people into raising money for those affected. Other places you’re able to donate can be found in the links in their bios on Instagram or visiting their official webpages. Fingers crossed relief is on its way</p>
