  <p><b>[Hector Bellerin has hailed Shkodran Mustafi as a great addition at Arsenal]</b> He has been a great addition to the team. He has adapted really well to the way we play. He likes to come out and look for people up front, and doesn’t kick long ball balls, he looks to play the ball on the floor and that’s really important to the way we play. Defensively he has grown since the first day, he is really confident around the other players, he will tell you what to do, he is a World Cup winner as well and a leader. The stats show he is a very positive defender and he is helping us get clean sheets. From the first day he was here we got on really well, on and off the pitch. From his time at Valencia, he speaks very good Spanish so that makes it easy - not just with me but other people in the back four. I feel very confident when I play with him because I know someone has got my back as well - not just the goalkeeper, you also know Shkodran will be there. I really like playing with him..</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal spent too much time waiting for something to happen]</b> We waited too long. In the first half, we were waiting for something to happen. We didn’t create chances, we didn’t have the ball like we should have done and then in the second half we paid for it. We need to take the initiative a bit more, to attack more and keep the ball because we didn’t do that today. In the second half, at the end they were tired, they weren’t pressing as much and we were creating a bit more space so we had chances. It’s a bit frustrating because you could see that we could have gone home with a point or even three. I think we weren’t at the standard required, so it’s something to look at for the next game.<br /><br />There’s still plenty of games to play. There are loads of points still to play for, so we need to look forward. We can’t just be stuck looking back at this game</p>

It does sometimes pop up on your timeline. I see it sometimes, some friends say ‘oh have you heard what that guy on Arsenal Fan TV said’. It’s so wrong for someone who claims to be a fan and their success is fed off a failure. How can that be a fan? There’s just people hustling, trying to make money their way, which everyone is entitled to do. For us players it doesn’t affect us. If they want to have fun with it, then have fun. When you grow you realise what is important to you to take <b>[on board]</b>. If a coach comes to me and says you’ve done something bad I’m going to take that advice. If someone from Arsenal Fan TV says this guy needs to do this or that I’m not going to listen to him. They’re entitled to their opinion and the way they want to do it. If people find it funny, then go watch it</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin believes that his new vegan diet is helping him on and off the pitch]</b> I’ve been vegan since the beginning of the season more or less,. At the beginning I wanted to try it for a couple of weeks to detox my body and stuff, but I just felt so great after it that I’ve been doing it for six months now. For me the most important thing is that inflammation in my body after games and the speed that my body recovers compared to before. I’ve always had little problems in my ankles when I played very hard games, they’d get very inflamed and stiff. Now I don’t even have to strap them to play anymore. It doesn’t just make a difference in your body but I strongly believe that with what we’re doing to the earth paying back the earth too. Getting rid of all the food I was eating and going to this plant based diet it did take those few days to actually feel better, but when it got to the beginning of the third week I felt so good. I was waking up in the mornings and had so much energy whereas before I used to be that person who would snooze the alarm five times before they got out of bed.<br /><br />As a professional athlete you have to be technical with what you eat. You have to make sure your intakes are on point every day. Players like Nacho Monreal and even <b>[Laurent]</b> Koscielny are always telling me ‘where is the meat on your plate?’ and ‘why aren’t you eating meat today?’. They always try and put meat on my plate and stuff like this - it’s all fun and it’s all good. This is a way for people to see that you can be an athlete and do it, and that can open doors for other people</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Bellerin claims to have quickly ended his feud with Arsenal team-mate Mesut Ozil following their on-field row against Stoke]</b> We are two passionate players and we love the game, and you get into those situations. Straight after the game, we were hugging each other. It happens and what happens on the pitch, stays on the pitch. I think he said something like, ‘You talk too much’ and to be fair, if I was a guy playing alongside myself, I do probably talk a bit too much! But I always want to give information to the players in front of me and I want players to demand from me as well. That is how it works. We only have a pair of eyes so, when you have players around you that can give you information, it is always important. It is normal to always get into things like that in games, this time the cameras picked it up. This is part of football, it happens every day and once it finishes, we are all friends again.</p>

I sound like a Londoner, my friends are from London - it’s the place I want to be right now. In the future, you never know. Obviously, I grew up in Barcelona, and when I watch them play I want them to win. The team are always going to be in my heart.<br /><br />At the beginning, I was someone who was doing really well. Then when things started going not that well, everything was just negative, negative, negative. As a team, if you don’t have the best season, it doesn’t help … It’s been a tough one. We were doing well until November. We always have that period where we suffer a little bit. As a team, the most important thing is results. If you can win beautifully like <b>[Manchester]</b> City do - even better</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Hector Bellerin has opened up on the abuse he has received from fans for daring to be different]</b> It can get very abusive. Most of the abuse is online, but you hear it in the stadium too. People have called me ‘lesbian’ for growing my hair. There are other kinds of homophobic insults. I have learnt to grow a thick skin but it can affect you. Every now again you get a bit of self-doubt. The problem is that people have an idea of what a footballer should look like, how they should behave, what they should talk about. If you act a little differently you become a target. There is pressure to conform. This is very dangerous. In life, you should be allowed to express yourself. People are happier like this.<br /><br />It’s impossible that anybody could be openly gay in football. Some fans are not ready.

  <p><b>[Hector Bellerin claims the Gunners are like a new club under Unai Emery]</b> It feels like a new club. We have so many new staff. It’s a shame for those who have gone, and I am grateful to them all. Some had been at the club for many years. But you can understand why a new person would like to put their own stamp on the club<br /><br />I am impressed with Emery. We lost our first two games but we were very close both times. After the match, the players could feel that things were coming together<br /><br />With Arsene, he wanted us to play in the same way regardless of the opponents. The idea was that we could play in our way and beat anyone. But Emery is very focused on preparing a plan for our next opponents, whoever they may be. It is very detailed and very professional. The next few months are going to be very exciting for all of us. We will reach a higher level<br /><br />VAR can remove injustices, but decisions need to be taken faster. Football is a game of speed and drama</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Bellerin admits to owing Arsene Wenger a lot]</b> Under Wenger I became the player that I am today because he’s the guy that signed me at 16. I owe him a lot and all the time I spent here he made me play so much even when I was really young. Those are things you owe him back. Now with Emery it’s more about following the process of becoming a professional footballer. I’m still really young. Personally it’s more about improving tactically now and taking experiences game by game. The coaching staff are really good. They have people who analyse the game to the detail, for that it is important to listen to them and improve every game.<br /><br />The environment we’ve been living in since the new coaching staff started is very positive. The whole mentality that he’s instilled in the dressing room is a winning one, a hard working one. He wants to make us really competitive and slowly we’re showing the improvements</p>

There’s loads of things that are changing for us, not just as a team but as a football club so the most important thing is to believe in the way that we want to play. We’re a team now that play from the back, we probably risk it a bit more than before, but for us it is important for our fans and for everyone around us to believe in this idea that we have. At the beginning it is going to be harder, but the more we train it, the more we work at it, the better we are going to get at it. For us it is about getting used to the system, be a team, be competitive and have this winning mentality, take it to the next level and become the team that the manager has in mind. I’m sure with the help of the fans and everyone at the club we will be able to do it.</p>

  <p><b>[Bellerin in awe of ‘born champion’ Ozil after heroics against Leicester]</b> Mesut is a player that always keeps giving his best and is always surprising everyone and he’s a player that we’re very grateful and very lucky to have. When the team play well with good football and he can find space he’s always a killer with his passes and finishes, so for us to have a player like him in the team is very important. It’s always a blessing to have players like that but the work comes from the whole team, and it comes from the back, from the goalkeeper to the striker. We’re all one and, when you have players with such quality, it’s always that little bit easier. Mesut is a player that has been through a lot in his career through loads of ups and downs, but most of all he’s a born champion and he’s a player who has so many records in the world of football, so he’s a player that is an example for everyone. Everyone wants to have the success that he’s had on and off the pitch, so for us to have someone like him as a captain is really important.<br /><br />These things can happen in football. You can’t always win and it’s something that we were a bit unlucky with as well, but it’s all about lifting your head up. It’s not about how many times you fall, it’s about getting up after and with the help of my team-mates we could get the game going. We knew that chances were going to come, so it’s important that we scored them. For us, it’s always important to improve and keep things realistic. It’s a new season with a new manager and, of course, we’re almost in November already, so things are getting a bit easier in terms of tactically and we know the way that the coach wants to play. As you can see on the pitch we’re way more organised and the football flows a bit more, but as I’ve said, it’s only the start and there’s a lot of work we still need to do. Hopefully, the results are going to keep coming.</p>

People have different passions, people have hobbies, people have lives outside their job, and nowadays it seems like the only thing we are allowed to do is train and play football. Football has always been my number one thing, but I have other things in my life, like fashion, which is something that has always been in my family. When I see people saying things like ‘He just dresses like that because he wants attention<br /><br />Fashion is something that brought me closer to my family as I grew up.

We’re not scared to play anyone, we’re not scared to play anywhere and as I said, there’s loads of positives to take. Loads of negatives as well, but this is part of the way and we’re looking on to the weekend now.<br /><br />I have to say it was great to play this kind of game. Loads of mistakes from both sides and those are things that we’ve got to look at and analyse and you know we’ve got to get better at. The tempo of the play, the goals - this is football. This is what you play football for, for nights like this. Whatever the score, today we’re gutted, but I’m sure there’s going to be nights that go in our favour. This is the thing, when you’ve been so close to winning and you lose at the end, it hurts. But this is what pushes you to do better in the next game.<br /><br />It’s not easy to score five goals at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. There’s not many teams that can say that they’ve done that. Sure, we conceded five, we conceded a penalty and Alex <b>[Oxlade-Chamberlain’s]</b> goal is one of those things that you just have to sit back and take it because there’s not much you can do about things like this</p>

What we need is to be there for each other. We are <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club, we always need to be at the top. Whenever we’re not at the top that means there’s improvement that needs to be done. That’s it, that’s what you get when you play for a big club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

  <p><b>[Bellerin reveals what makes <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Gabriel Martinelli</a> so special as he tips <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> hero to develop into star player]</b> A lot of people talk about his talent, but what people don’t see is that Gabi is a professional. He turns up early every day. He does all the stuff and everything anyone asks him to do. He is the first player to press and the last player to leave everything on the pitch. The goals are just a plus. He helps us in every single way and the thing that everyone needs to praise him for is his attitude. That is what makes him a player<br /><br />He is obviously really young in his career - so many things can happen - but if he keeps his head where it is right now, he is going to go really far for sure<br /><br /><b>[the manner of the performance, rather than the equaliser, that particularly pleased <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> right-back]</b> Obviously I am very happy with the goal. But what truly made me happy was seeing everyone really defending with heart, with spirit and playing for each other after losing a man in the early moments of the game. It is really difficult to get back into the game twice, especially at a place like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. That is what really made me happy<br /><br />I think one of the most important things is to believe in the manager. I think we have all realised that if we play the way he tells us to play we will do great things and everyone is really motivated. Everyone is playing for each other, everyone is running. You could see that in the last 10, 15 minutes of the game - we had 10 players in our box defending for their lives. That is what it is about. Sometimes that is the way to win games</p>

When you see that you’re playing better and controlling games better, the goals are something that’s going to come. I’m sure you’re going to see that very quickly. For us, the promise is that we’re trying to get better every single day. When a different coach comes, there are different things that you’re being asked to do. The most important thing is to get things right and I think with the coaching that we’re getting and the tactical advice, if we do the things that they’re asking us to do we’re going to be successful</p>

  <p><b>[Bellerin believes he is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain material despite not being of the Adams &amp; Vieira mould]</b> Since I was young at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, I would always be one of the three captains in the team. For me, it was a role I’m used to. Obviously it’s not the same when you’re 14 or 15 as it is now because the responsibility and what you represent is completely different, but it’s always been something that I’ve enjoyed. I enjoy positions of responsibility and I enjoy being the first one on that wall.<br /><br />For me, I had been speaking to the coach for a few months and he was telling me that I could be one of the people that could represent the team. I was really happy with it because I’m someone who’s been here for a long time and I know how the club runs.<br /><br />People may not see me as this massive guy who shouts on the pitch all the time or what people may have as a captain in their heads, but there are so many different ways of leading a team. Everyone in the team respects each other and we have so many leaders who don’t need to wear the armband to have an impact on how others think.<br /><br />After going through so many different captains and characters from my time here so far, you always get the best things from all of them. The time I’ve been here has been really useful for that and whether I was captain or not, I’ve always been someone who’s liked to help and talk from the team’s perspective.<br /><br />I’m not afraid of those things so for me, it’s something I’m very proud of. I’m very honoured to be part of this group and it’s something this team needs. I’m very happy that I was approached and then for the votes I received in the dressing room. That shows my team-mates trust me to do that job, and I’m happy to do it when I have to. In the group we have, we have so many different qualities where each person can give what they have to the team.<br /><br />I think it’s really important to have a strong captain but there are also people outside of our leadership group like Papa <b>[Sokratis]</b>, like <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>, who have gone through a lot and have so much experience. When they raise their voice, they’re listened to as much as the leadership group are.<br /><br />That’s more important than anything else. Sometimes it’s not just about having that one figure, it’s about everyone in the dressing room respecting each other, listening to each other and moving forward in the same direction. That’s what we’ve got here at Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Bellerin: The world would be ‘a much better place’ if social media trolls were held accountable for their actions]</b> It’s strange that in the world we live in today people act like this. I think if everyone was held more accountable then the world would be a much better place. Social media can be great in getting you that contact with fans, but it can also be very hard. You have to learn to deal with it. When it <b>[abuse]</b> happens you want to write back, but then you realise that for every one bad message you can have 100 good messages that you don’t notice so much<br /><br />We are disgusted to see the racist abuse aimed at <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="gabriel-agbonlahor.html">Gabriel Agbonlahor</a> and their families today. At any time, this is abhorrent behaviour, but when people should be coming together more than ever, it is particularly disturbing. It is unacceptable for social networks to allow instances like this to go on. With the technology and expertise at their disposal, there simply must be a way to prevent abuse like this from being sent. Anything less than that is not good enough<br /><br />I think right now footballers have such a big platform that they must utilise and use in the best ways possible. If you are lucky your career can continue until you are 35 or 40, so you need to make sure you have everything set up for when you retire. By building your brand early you can have a much better chance at creating success for yourself</p>
