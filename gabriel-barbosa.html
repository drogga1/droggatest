I was at home playing video games, listening to music, and I came to the Vila Belmiro to watch the match. Victor couldn’t play and I only found out <b>[I was on the bench]</b> when I was already at the stadium. I had the opportunity, I went on, and I scored. It was meant to be</p>

  <p><b>[Gabigol insists it is still his dream to make an impact in Italy with Inter]</b> Right now I’m completely focused on Santos. We’ll see what happens at the end of my loan. I leave everything in the hands of God, but certainly I dream of wearing the Nerazzurri jersey again. I’d be very happy if I did. What didn’t work out for me? I chose the Nerazzurri for the project they’d proposed to me. I was very motivated and eager to show my worth. I arrived with a great desire to play and make history, but unfortunately things didn’t go as planned. My characteristics didn’t square up with the club, but I respect them a lot. I made many new friends there, especially with my teammates, from Brazilians like Miranda and Felipe Melo to Joao Mario, who went there the same time as me. It was a very useful experience, despite having played little. I’m a young player, I have my whole career ahead of me, so I try to absorb everything in terms of experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Gabigol is back! Inter’s €30m flop on fire as top scorer in Brazil]</b> They are a great team and I was very well received. Things did not go as I wanted but I have a lot of affection for everyone there, the fans and the players. Perhaps my adaptation was not ideal but I was able to learn the language, I made a lot of friends in Italy and I love Milan. But the team was not doing well at that time and the coach preferred to use players with more experience and not take a gamble. But I learned a lot, picked up experience and I hope they do well this year.<br /><br /><b>[Encouraged by Rodrygo’s imminent move to Real Madrid]</b> I would love to play in La Liga. If I get the chance one day I would be very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Inter striker Gabriel Barbosa is open to a move to the Premier League]</b> They are all important clubs with top quality players. Hopefully everything will be good for everyone if we reach an agreement. There are many things involved, mainly Inter as they hold my rights. It hasn’t been decided yet, but it is very unlikely I will remain in Brazil. The Premier League always had great strikers and it is a joy to watch on TV. It is very competitive, fast-paced and dynamic, with loads of title contenders. There is quality everywhere, that’s why everybody loves it and I am no different. It attracts me a lot. I follow the Brazilians, sometimes we talk and all of them love playing in the Premier League.<br /><br />It has been a very good year for me. Individually it has been spectacular. I have matured a lot and playing more games gives you more confidence. I’ve played a lot of games and learned a lot. I wish for 2019 to be another happy year for me, as good as the one at Santos so far. What I can assure you is that my dedication will be at the maximum level. I want to play as well as possible to be called up again for the national team. In order to achieve that I need to score many goals, as every striker tries to do</p>

  <p><b>[Both Flamengo and Palmeiras are said to be keen on his signature ahead of the new year]</b> The rumours? I am proud of these rumours about big clubs. I am linked to Santos, but I do not close the door to anyone. Now I am going back to Inter, but I like the rumours, I just want to be happy and play, no matter where. I am happy to be an Inter player, it is a great club.</p>

I was always sure I wanted to play at Flamengo one day. When I came to Inter the coach Frank de Boer told me I would have a chance in the first team, but with so many changes that never happened. The club was going through a hard time and wanted more experienced players, and I understand that. But I was never given a chance in the team to show my talents</p>

It really is a place I would like to play. It’s one of the best leagues in the world.

When I went to Europe I was young and had many things to learn. Now I find myself much more experienced and mature, living the best phase of my life - 2019 has been a magical year. I feel like a new player. Europe is a natural place for all players who stand out in Brazil but things didn’t go the way I imagined on my first trip. Adaptation is never easy, despite being with my family there. It’s a new culture, a new country, a new way of playing. All this, whether you like it or not, ends up messing with you. But I do not regret going. I never bowed my head in the face of difficulties and always tried to work the best way possible because I trust my potential and know how much I can learn and improve</p>
