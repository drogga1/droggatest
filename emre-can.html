  <p><b>[Emre Can said that he has personally never experienced racism in Italy]</b> Personally for me I’ve never <b>[experienced racism in Italy]</b>. Of course you hear about it often and I think it’s a shame, because every human being is equal, no matter which colour his skin or his hair is. Those are just idiots who do such things. I think it happens all over the world and you can’t say it happens only in Italy. It’s a shame, honestly, a big shame.<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder says children need better education on a variety of issues, and that will make the world a better place for all involved]</b> A few days ago I heard an interview of Freiburg manager Christian Streich and he said something very intelligent. The children today are not to blame. The people who let them grow up like that are to blame, meaning us all. When we were young it just wasn’t like it is today, but a 10-year-old kid doesn’t buy a smartphone on his own, his parents buy it. I think education has to change again. Kids have to climb on trees sometimes or get injured while playing. That’s how you get mature and back then my mom ranted at me when I had too much laundry, because I had mud everywhere on my clothes. But it’s just like that, I was on the streets. Thank god for me it was like go play in the streets at 10am and come back home when it was dark outside. Luckily I lived these days and it was the most beautiful time for me<br /><br /><b>[Can also added that he thinks the rise of social media has played a part while also proving a negative stressor for footballers playing at a high level]</b> <b>[Technology]</b> has become too much, unfortunately. I hope that the people talk more with each other again. When you look at people in a restaurant - that counts for myself as well - they are sitting there with their smartphones, watching something on it, so there is no conversation, which is a shame. And social media is a fake world. Unfortunately it has become extreme. Also we football players take social media too seriously sometimes, but unfortunately there is no other way nowadays</p>

  <p><b>[Emre Can says his move to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in 2014 was a vital moment in his career]</b> I can still remember when I came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was only 20 years old and many people in Germany said, ‘Why is he doing that now? He is only 20, it is too early to go abroad’. But I was sure that I could make it there. I wanted to do that and because of that I went there and looking back it was exactly the right step. I proved myself there like in every team I have played in until now.<br /><br /><b>[For now, though, he’s happy with Juventus, where he made 36 appearances while scoring four goals in his debut season]</b> I started to play football on the streets where I grew up in Nordweststadt, Frankfurt. At the beginning I played in the streets and then I always said to my parents that I want to go to a club. At the first club there were too many kids already, they rejected me, and then at the second club, Blau-Gelb Frankfurt, I had two training sessions with kids my age, but they said ‘He is too good’ and I went to play with kids one year older than me. There it all began and I played at this club for six years, and after these six years Eintracht came. At 12 or 13 years old, I went to Eintracht and played there for three years. Of course Frankfurt will always be my city. My parents and my friends live there and I can imagine playing for Eintracht again one day. You never know what happens in football. You should never say never</p>
