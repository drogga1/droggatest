  <p><b>[Juventus target Emre Can has ruled out a January move away from Liverpool by airing a desire to win a trophy with the club]</b> First of all there are still many games with Liverpool to concentrate on, but I hope to be able to stay healthy and go to the World Cup in the summer. We have been in a good way and we want to try to continue winning as many games as possible and hopefully that can mean having a good run in the FA Cup as well as the Premier League and the Champions League. We want to win a trophy. We are full of belief that winning a title is something this squad is capable of achieving and we will give our best.<br /><br />It’s a big honour for me to play so many games for the club in just three-and-a-half years. Reaching that milestone is something that I am very proud of. Not too many people play that many games for a club like Liverpool by the age of 23 and you can’t do that if you are not a good player. I’m very thankful to all the trainers, the manager and all the staff here for the part they have played in helping me to achieve that because without them it wouldn’t have been possible. I am always my own biggest critic and although I am pleased with my development in these three-and-a-half seasons I know there are a lot of areas that I can still improve</p>

It’s unbelievable how good they are. They did it again. We are always happy if they can score and we win.<br /><br />I’m happy that I could score because we trained it and I scored like that. It’s always good when you train something and score like that. I’m happy, of course, when I can score and help the team<br /><br />It’s a really important <b>[time of the season]</b>. The next game is next week against Newcastle at home again - and we want to win that as well. We have to look from game to game and our aim is to win every game</p>

  <p><b>[Emre Can is being linked with a return to Bayern Munich]</b> No, definitely not. Today you can see that it was the right decision. At that time it was like this: Pep Guardiola has come, and I have played a good preparation under him. Then we had a very, very honest conversation. I was very young and it was important for me to play a lot. He told me honestly: ‘I cannot guarantee you now that you will play every week’. Then I saw the opportunity in Leverkusen. They also played in the Champions League. For many it was a step backwards. But for me it was a step forward because I always played in Leverkusen. Today you can see that it has paid off<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Bayern made a mistake in letting him go]</b> I would not say that. Whether they have made a mistake, they have to decide for themselves<br /><br />I’ve developed a lot under Jurgen Klopp. I am very grateful to him, and it is a lot of fun to work with him<br /><br /><b>[Asked where he sees himself in three years]</b> I want to become a world-class player. Maybe once in the world selection. That would be great</p>

  <p><b>[Besar Halimi, one of Emre Can’s closest friends, is unsure if the midfielder will stay at Liverpool]</b> I don’t know if he will stay at Liverpool. If we meet we do not talk about football that much. I hope he will make the right decision. But it does not matter which way he’ll choose, it won’t be a bad ending for him. We noticed very early that Emre has the potential to become a big player. Until now he is a very good friend of mine and we try to spend as much time as possible together. In his youth days he already had an incredible technique and was very strong. Nevertheless we never dreamed that Emre would come so far. But he deserved everything because he is a great guy who worked very hard to fulfill his dreams. I am delighted for him. In our youth squad he showed that he was the best in every single game.<br /><br />I remember one indoor tournament, where Emre scored ten goals in a single game. At the end he was the top goalscorer of the tournament with thirty more goals than the second place player. It was unbelievable. He has so much power and so much talent. Emre is a real professional and I respect him a lot for this. Although we are the same age he is an idol for me. He is a very good guy - on and off the field.<br /><br />Emre managed to stay grounded in spite of his money and fame. It’s very hard to be famous at such a young age but Emre still is the same guy that I know from our youth days in Frankfurt. He never forgot where he came from… in my opinion he is an idol for every young footballer</p>

Any player would like to play next to him, it would be great.<br /><br />My first manager was Italian, when I was very young he told me one day I’d play for Juventus, and now I’m fortunately here. The mentality at Juventus is that we just want to win titles. That’s my mentality too. I came here to win titles<br /><br />I feel at home in the midfield. Of course, in the end, the manager decides and I just want to help the team and always give my best. Whether it’s defender, striker, goalkeeper or midfield<br /><br />Offers? Yes, that’s true, I had many offers from very good teams but I chose Juventus for the project, this is a very big team and I’m happy to be a part of it. All the players have welcomed me in a nice way, I feel good vibes. Zinedine Zidane was my idol when I was child, and he’s someone who played here as well</p>

I would like to state that the comments made were never focused on nor meant to degrade women, women’s football or equality in any form.

  <p><b>[Emre Can says that he has found training with Juventus even more difficult than with Liverpool]</b> I already complained to Jurgen Klopp about the hard training in Liverpool!

But now my body has got used to it<br /><br /><b>[Can said of Klopp]</b> He was disappointed. He wanted me to stay in Liverpool, but accepted my decision. He also knew that it was not a decision against him or against Liverpool, but for a new challenge at Juventus. I had a wonderful and memorable time in Liverpool and will always be grateful to all the people who have supported me there. I am still in touch with Jurgen Klopp<br /><br /><a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is a tactical mastermind. He adjusts us differently before every match, constantly trying out new variants. We have to attack and defend differently in each match. For him, every little detail is important. As a person <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is great, very funny. Many people from outside do not think so, because he always seems serious on the coaching zone, but he often jokes and laughs a lot - although I honestly hardly understand him, because he is from Tuscany and speaks a dialect which is very difficult to understand!</p>

  <p><b>[Emre Can has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo as insane]</b> The Ronaldo effect is so huge. Whether in the city, the club or the league - everyone talks about him. But everyone always talks about the world-class player Ronaldo. For me, it’s the person who counts first and foremost. He is very friendly, a down-to-earth-guy. Everyone in the team gets on well with him. And for sure, what he does on the pitch is unbelievable. Even at 34, he always wants to be the best and show the world match by match again what he can. His performance against Atletico was insane.<br /><br />So far so good. But we have not won anything yet, we are entering the crucial period of the season. We want to win the Scudetto and the Champions League. Above all, the desire to win the Champions League is huge in the club and in the city. The team has been on the verge of winning the title over the past few years. Of course, there are strong competitors, but we will do everything to make it possible this year</p>

Looking back, my decision to leave Bayern was the best decision for me and my career.<br /><br />I did not play a single minute back then, so I do not feel like a Champions League winner.

  <p><b>[Emre Can on being Zidane as a kid]</b> When you played on the streets in my generation you were either Zidane or Ronaldinho. I was Zidane, he was my favourite player and my Idol. The way he touched the ball was impressive. As a child you should be climbing trees and hurting your knees. It is the only way to grow up. At the weekends we were outside from 10 in the morning until 7pm. That was the best time for me, even though my mum was mad because she had so many clothes to wash.<br /><br />I would not say it did not work out with Bayern. I had a contract back then and the club wanted to keep me, but I did not really see the possibility to play often. But for a young player it is important to be on the pitch as often as possible. Leverkusen gave me that possibility. Looking back, that transfer was the best decision for me. Many people in Germany said: ‘What is he doing?’ But I was sure I could make it there. And in the end I did. No matter where I was, I always made it and that is my target now for Juventus and the national team as well<br /><br />Why not? One day, when I am a little older, Turkey is surely a possibility. I can imagine living and play in Istanbul one day. That is a wonderful city. You should never say never. Frankfurt is my city and it stays my city. My parents and my friends live there and I visit them regularly when I have a couple of days off. And I follow Eintracht as well.

Of course you hear about it often and I think it’s a shame, because every human being is equal, no matter which colour his skin or his hair is. Those are just idiots who do such things. I think it happens all over the world and you can’t say it happens only in Italy. It’s a shame, honestly, a big shame.<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder says children need better education on a variety of issues, and that will make the world a better place for all involved]</b> A few days ago I heard an interview of Freiburg manager Christian Streich and he said something very intelligent. The children today are not to blame. The people who let them grow up like that are to blame, meaning us all. When we were young it just wasn’t like it is today, but a 10-year-old kid doesn’t buy a smartphone on his own, his parents buy it. I think education has to change again. Kids have to climb on trees sometimes or get injured while playing. That’s how you get mature and back then my mom ranted at me when I had too much laundry, because I had mud everywhere on my clothes. But it’s just like that, I was on the streets. Thank god for me it was like go play in the streets at 10am and come back home when it was dark outside. Luckily I lived these days and it was the most beautiful time for me<br /><br /><b>[Can also added that he thinks the rise of social media has played a part while also proving a negative stressor for footballers playing at a high level]</b> <b>[Technology]</b> has become too much, unfortunately. I hope that the people talk more with each other again. When you look at people in a restaurant - that counts for myself as well - they are sitting there with their smartphones, watching something on it, so there is no conversation, which is a shame. And social media is a fake world. Unfortunately it has become extreme. Also we football players take social media too seriously sometimes, but unfortunately there is no other way nowadays</p>

A lot can always happen in football<br /><br /><b>[The Germany international also exasperated over a perceived lack of commitment from young footballers]</b> They have the chance of a lifetime if they are allowed to practice with the professionals. However, some of them sometimes have a body language that almost makes me angry. I often go to these players at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, talk to them, try to show them what they can do when they try hard and show themselves. But some don’t understand it.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd-linked Emre Can increasingly likely to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in January]</b> It was very shocking for me because last week I was told and promised something else. Yesterday I got a call from the coach, in which he told me in less than a minute and without explanation that I was not in the squad. I can not explain it, nobody has given me a reason until now. Me and my agent had talks with other clubs, Paris <b>[Saint-Germain]</b> as well. After discussions with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, we decided to stay with the club. A condition was to play in the Champions League, and that was what I was promised. Yesterday it was said - one day after the transfer period ended - that I’m not in. It just makes me angry how they’ve dealt with me. I’ll deal with the consequences when I get back and talk to the club. I want, and I have, to play in the Champions League</p>
