  <p><b>[Barcelona wonderkid <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> Simons announces departure from Liga giants]</b> It was a dream come true when I put on my first <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> jersey nine years ago as a pre-benjamin (under-8) player. Through the years I have experienced victories and defeats, I have fallen and gotten back up time and time again. Through it all, my team-mates, my coaches and the entire staff at La Masia have been there by my side, every single day. Even if I am only 16 years old, I have also felt the love and support of hundreds of thousands of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fans that wanted me to keep growing and someday make it to the Camp Nou<br /><br />To all of you, I can only say: thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, I will never forget our time together and will forever cherish the memories. As I am about to start a new and exciting adventure away from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, this club, its people and its fans will always hold a special place in my heart. Forca <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>!</p>

  <p>I prefer to assist than to score. For me, assists are the most important. When I score, I am happy, but if a team-mate scores I am also happy. So I prefer to assist because it’s good for the team. I’m more into position play. I don’t like tricks, but when it is necessary I’ll do a trick. I’m more into tiki-taka</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> youngster <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> Simons says It’s everyone’s dream to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> but I chose my own path]</b> If you are young, you really enjoy it. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is very big, but you don’t realise it when you’re so young. You always have to be yourself and act normally. I think I did that. I’m a very calm guy, but that changes when I’m on the pitch. Then I become a player with a lot of character.<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best player in the world, of course. Everyone dreams about playing with him, but sometimes you have to choose another way. I decided to begin a new adventure and I think that’s good for my development<br /><br />At the beginning it was very tough, because they are physically stronger than me. But now I’m used to it and I feel good. And I already trained with the first team, I was very happy with that<br /><br /><b>[Currently, Simons is preparing for Euro qualifying with the Netherlands U17s, although he could someday be eligible to represent Spain]</b> I feel proud when I’m here and I also like to play together with some guys that I normally don’t get to play with. It’s nice to represent your country. I only have a Dutch passport, but I could also request a Spanish one. But that’s not an issue right now.</p>
