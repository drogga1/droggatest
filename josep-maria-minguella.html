The day’s proceedings continued with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s first agent Josep Maria Minguella speaking to the courtroom]</b> When the player excelled and needed help with financial matters, he brought them to the offices of the Juarez law firm, who became responsible for his income for seven or eight years. The <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> family had very little knowledge of these matters</p>

  <p><b>[Josep Maria Minguella, a former agent of Lionel Messi, has claimed that Kylian Mbappe wanted to join Barcelona during the summer]</b> It would have been €120 million plus €30m bonus. The boy only wanted to go to Barcelona when he learned that Neymar was leaving. He didn’t want to go to Paris or Madrid, who have their front three, he wanted to go there and nowhere else. But Barca were on Dembele, Dembele and Dembele, because a year earlier they had wanted to sign him for €15 million.<br /><br />I’ve nothing against Bartomeu, but he’s a disaster. These are the key moments. I fully understood that he didn’t want to go to Madrid or Paris. He’d have been mad with joy to play alongside Lionel Messi</p>

  <p><b>[Josep Maria Minguella, an agent with close connections to Barca, claimed last week that the Catalan club could and should have bought Mbappe]</b> They had him in their hands when it was known Neymar was leaving. I spoke to his father. The boy, when he knew Neymar was leaving, said he only wanted to play for Barca. That he didn’t want to go to Paris, or to Madrid, because of the BBC <b>[Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b>.<br /><br />Barca were just thinking about <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele.
