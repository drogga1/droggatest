  <p><b>[PSG sporting director Antero Henrique insists that Real Madrid should not have spoken about Neymar]</b> Talking about a player from another club on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo picked up his fifth Ballon d’Or was not very nice for his own player.<br /><br /><b>[Neymar is happy in France]</b> Neymar is happy. He loves the club and is doing very well here. It is not a question of money, it is a question of stability. Neymar has accepted our vision. He is very ambitious and PSG offered him the space to work on these ambitions</p>

  <p><b>[Antero Henrique has lamented the timing of Neymar’s injury]</b> On the field, he’s the best player in the world. He helps us in a fantastic way. But off the field he helps us, too, with his spirit, his relationship with the other players, staff and the fans. Even if can’t play against Real, we feel that Neymar’s with us. He’s already sent many messages of encouragement.<br /><br />It’s not a nightmare. It’s a classic football injury, he can run. It just comes at the wrong time, before this crucial meeting with Real. We’d prefer to play with the best player in the world than without him - that makes sense. Neymar is the leader of the team, but his team-mates will give everything for him and the club</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Antero Henrique claims that Neymar is going nowhere in the summer despite constant links with Real Madrid]</b> Obviously he’s going to stay with PSG next season. His father said that two or three days ago: he’s happy in Paris. His project is to stay here. He’s here to play and score goals. The Spanish aren’t like the French, they’re against PSG. For them, we’re now rivals. Spanish journalists have spoken to guys who say that Neymar isn’t happy, good … have you asked Cristiano Ronaldo if he’s happy at Real Madrid?.</p>

  <p><b>[PSG turn to Thomas Tuchel in hunt for Emery successor]</b> Every day we are confronted with news about the PSG coach. To be clear: the coach of Paris Saint-Germain is Unai Emery, he has a contract with the club and this is not the time to talk about this subject. We are in an important phase of the season, we have a lot of work to do to reach our goals and we need to be focused and engaged. No coach can say that he has spoken with us or is engaged with us for the future. All supporters of Paris Saint-Germain must know that only the club is authorised to communicate official information.</p>

  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot has misled Paris Saint-Germain and will be benched for an indefinite period]</b> At this point, no. It was a decision made by the club following a meeting I had with the player. The player informed me that he would not sign a contract and that he wanted to leave the club by being free at the end of the season. For the player, this will have a very clear consequence: he will remain on the bench for an indefinite period.<br /><br />Several months ago, we had positive exchanges with his representative in the perspective that he remains at the club and signs a new contract. We also accepted all the conditions of the player related to the sports field. We had discussed these conditions so that he would stay with us for years to come. But, unfortunately, from now on, the discussions have totally stopped<br /><br />It seems that the player and his representative have misled us for several months. I must add that this situation is disrespectful for both the club and the fans. Especially from a player who has played under our colours from the academy to the first team and a player who has always received the full support of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Antero Henrique has hit back at Adrien Rabiot’s agent]</b> Madame Rabiot said that we received an offer this summer. This is true, we received a bid on the 29th August, 20 hours before the closure of the summer transfer window. It is simple, this means that Barcelona must have had an agreement with Rabiot before coming to discuss with us. You have to know that Barcelona’s offer was ridiculous. For us, the club, we were very surprised by this low offer. The offer was disrespectful for some of Rabiot’s standing. I insist, it is not possible to reach an agreement with a player like Adrien in 24 hours. So it is clear that Barcelona must have already had an agreement with Adrien.<br /><br /><b>[Veronique Rabiot also held that her son had not agreed a move with any other club ahead of his prospective free transfer in June]</b> I have to make clear that from the moment we had found an agreement in principle to extend the player’s deal, his representative and the lawyers, without an explanation, stopped negotiations. I am sure that he has found an agreement with another club. When they stopped negotiations, it was clear for me that Adrien had a deal with another club. Could Rabiot leave this winter? He told me he doesn’t want to stay at PSG</p>
