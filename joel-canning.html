<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How British football coaches are being hit hard by coronavirus crisis]</b> In the last week the business has gone from being very successful with 120 goalkeepers working a week - with buzzing sessions with 10 coaches working - on top of myself. Now, we are just trying to keep the business going in any way we can. We have resorted to online learning, resources and technical drills to keep the training going. Some people can no longer afford these extras with their children, so immediately it is a massive financial hit. Some have stuck with us for now but we worry that they might not stick with us. Losing people is to be expected given the situation, but we worry online training can only go so far, and we feel we are the world’s leading goalkeeping business. We are a franchise model working with 30 centres offering coaching from ex-pros and academy level coaches<br /><br />We are a thriving business. Now we are already seeing people tighten their belts on luxuries like ours. To keep our business going, we need customers to stay. We are now in a position where we are working out how many we can lose without going under. We have already taken a 20 per cent hit on our income. I have told coaches there isn’t any work for them. I have paid them until the end of the month to give them extra support with no sessions. Beyond that? Who knows really. The franchise business and sole traders don’t have any clarity on what is going to happen at the moment. There have been leaks but right now there’s nothing really there. I am on the edge of my seat, desperate to find out about support for grants and funding</p>
