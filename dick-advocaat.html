  <p><b>[Dick Advocaat after leading Sunderland to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> survival]</b> I’ve never cried over football before - no no - but this was a special reason. My friend Bert van Lingen - we have done 25 years together - came over. He was crying, so I didn’t need much encouragement. He said, ‘Let it go’, so I said ‘Why not?’ and did the same</p>

  <p><b>[Dick Advocaat insists he did not tout himself for the job as Netherlands coach]</b> It is nonsense that I went down on my knees to get this job. I did not have the desire to become national team coach and did not even see myself as a real candidate at first. If others mentioned my name or if <b>[his agent]</b> Rob Jansen advised the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> <b>[Dutch FA]</b>, that did not happen because I asked them to do so. It would not have been a problem for me had they gone for someone else. But that did not happen. They picked me</p>

  <p><b>[Dick Advocaat speaks about the return of Robin van Persie]</b> I worked with him last season at Fenerbahce where he showed what he could do. Robin is a player we might still need but we’ll see in the next weeks how fit he is and if he is playing</p>

  <p><b>[Dick Advocaat has described his Rangers tenure as the most beautiful period]</b> I have a special bond with Rangers. It was the most beautiful period of my life, really special. Rangers have style. There is a lot from the club and the fans that make you aware of that. Something happens to your mind and your body. It comes from everybody there up to the lady who does the washing. Everything about the club has style<br /><br />In Holland they still underestimate Scottish football a little but Celtic and Rangers are top European clubs. I saw some games from them and they are really close to the level they want. It’s the same for Celtic. In that game <b>[at Ibrox]</b> it was only one game, and I didn’t see Feyenoord. Tomorrow we have to do it differently. We have to show what we want and we have a very fanatical crowd here, the same as Ibrox. We need those supporters to make us give them a surprise<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the comparison with this game and that final in Manchester 11 years ago, a smile crept across his face as he replied]</b> I am quite confident but in that evening I was more confident. A surprise is always possible<br /><br /><b>[In memory of former Dutch international Fernando Ricksen, who had lost his battle with motor neurone disease the day before]</b> To speak about him is still difficult. He was a guy who fought so hard to stay alive for his family. I brought him first to Rangers and he is a legend there. After that he had some problems and I brought him to <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a>, and he became a legend there as well but in a different way. For me he was a really great guy and always honest. Even when he had a dark side as well. I feel very sorry for his family</p>

  <p><b>[Dick Advocaat praises <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>’s Rangers impact as Feyenoord boss prepares for key Europa League showdown]</b> It is quite difficult to speak about him as a player because he was one of the world’s best midfielders. Now he is going in a different job as a manager for a big club and everybody knows how difficult that is. But if you see, from the moment he stepped in it is only going up and that says enough about his quality<br /><br />It is a cracking game, I am looking forward to it so much, it will be a great game. I have a special bond with Rangers. I was there for four years and I can now tell you that it was the most beautiful period of my life, really something special. People think the Dutch competition is better but for me Scotland, Turkey and Russia as well, they have more tools, more finances, than most of the clubs in Holland. In Holland they still underestimate Scottish football a little but Celtic and Rangers are those European top clubs. I saw some games from them and they are really close to the level they want</p>

  <p><b>[Feyenoord are aware of Arsenal’s interest, with current boss Dick Advocaat confirming in March that the Gunners were one of the clubs keeping an eye on the teenager, who has been valued at around £20 million ($25m)]</b> It seems that what I read is true. But no one has yet come to Feyenoord (to make their interest clear)</p>
