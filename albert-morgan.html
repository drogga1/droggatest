  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> kitman recalls burst sewage pipe in Sunderland changing room]</b> There was a ‘drip, drip, drip’ with a bucket underneath so we thought it was a leak in the ceiling. The boys were getting ready, all walking around this bucket and went out on the pitch for the warm up. We’d been there for a few minutes and one of the security guards came and he said: ‘Albert, I think you better come in the dressing room, that bucket’s getting a bit full.’ By the time we got back in the changing room the bucket had been changed to a bin. Well, we walked in and they had these ceiling tiles, before you could say ‘whip’, one of the ceiling tiles just burst out. Sh<em>t everywhere! The gaffer just got out. It was all over the suits, the clothes, up the walls, up the ceiling. <a href="dimitar-berbatov.html">Dimitar Berbatov</a> was going mad about his shoes, his shoes had just sunk in three inches. You couldn’t save a thing. Everything was gone. Shoes, suits. The only thing we could do was go into the lads’ socks and shoes to get the jewellery and watches. This is ten to three. The game kicks off at three. They had to put the game back half an hour. He comes in a door at the back of the dressing room. He had this brush, it must have been 14-foot wide. And there’s big Brucie coming in at the back just shovelling this sh</em>t out of the dressing room. We just put the suits in black bags and destroyed the lot</p>
