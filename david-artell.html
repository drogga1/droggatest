  <p><b>[Manager David Artell is now focused on the game at Mansfield and says, if he makes changes to his side, the players - Dave Richards included - must take their chance]</b> Will Jaaskelainen is in Helsinki or somewhere. If we do make changes - obviously Dave will come in - they have to go and play well and stake their claim. It’s an opportunity for them, you only have to look at the Middlesbrough game - some lads were terrific and set a new standard for themselves</p>

  <p><b>[Manager David Artell had assumed he could not count on Will Jaaskelainen this weekend, after he was called up for Finland under 21s for a <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> European Championships qualifying match in Voluntari, near Bucharest]</b> We’re blessed with two very good keepers so we’ll see where we get to with it. Daniel Powell trained on Monday, albeit modified, and will again today (Tuesday), albeit modified, and we’ll take it from there and see if he’s available. If he is, he’ll be in contention. With Eddie Nolan, the swelling is going down and he’ll be back involved, by Thursday at the latest I imagine<br /><br /><b>[Artell made the long trip to Chippenham to watch Northampton, who have climbed to ninth in League Two thanks to a good run of form, progress in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup on Sunday]</b> It’ll be a stern test, they are going well and they have a certain way about them. We have to match that then do what we do. They have a distinct way about them which has been drilled into them by a good manager, an experienced manager, and they are carrying that out.<br /><br />Have they got weaknesses? Of course. When we go to places we go with no fear, knowing we are a good team</p>
