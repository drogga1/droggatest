  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Eric Bailly has seen little competitive football of late but insists that his troublesome knee feels good]</b> I’m fine. The injury happened, but I have recovered physically and it feels good.<br /><br /><b>[On United’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool]</b> Yes, of course I watched it, with my friends. I have lots of friends in this team and we watched it together. It was a good game and a very important point for us, equalising at the end of the match. It’s good for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Bailly is hoping to become a great player at Manchester United]</b> Hopefully I can play in Manchester all my life. I’m very happy here because it is such a great club. It’s such an honour to play for United and I hope I can continue giving my best to become a great player in this club. It’s difficult to claim the position of being a first-team player, but I have to enjoy every minute I get because it’s a wonderful club and I’m very happy to be there and to be part of it. I’m happy to be at such a big club. I never dreamed a better dream than playing for Man United. Hopefully I can enjoy every bit of it every day.<br /><br />There are a lot of new players and the coach is new. Now we are noting that the team is gelling together and creating a good atmosphere, and we are having the results too. We know that with a coach like Mourinho, he can bring the best out of players, so I’m very confident that this team can go further. The players are getting a good understanding both on and off the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Eric Bailly taking advice from rival at City]</b> I was at a good Spanish club in Villarreal, but when a team as prestigious as Manchester United makes you an offer it is hard to say no. That is despite the fact I had not planned to leave Villarreal so soon, and I knew I would get less playing time at United. But I knew that I would improve under a coach like Mourinho, and with teammates such as Wayne Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Juan Mata. They are players who have won lots of trophies but are still hungry for more. They are true examples of professionalism, and I draw great inspiration from them. And despite everything I have played 27 games for United in all competitions.<br /><br />I meet up with Yaya Toure on rare occasions, and we are in contact with one another. He gives me advice. Didier Drogba and Wilfried Bony do so as well, and the advice I get from them all is invaluable.</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Bailly has credited Jose Mourinho with convincing him that Manchester United were a better transfer option than Barcelona and Manchester City]</b> I was in the Ivory Coast, I got called from a ­Portuguese number, he ­introduced himself but I just didn’t ­believe it at first.<br /><br />Before I came to Man United, it was City who had been watching me. In my mind, I was going there. But then everything changed. It felt like Mourinho was the one who really wanted me. He showed more interest, he rang me and that’s why I’m at Man United. Man City contacted my agent, Barcelona as well were talking to my agent, but they weren’t as interested in me as Mourinho. He really pushed for the move. Of course the club is ­important when you sign, but the manager is so important. If a player feels like the manager wants you, wants to sign you, it gives you extra motivation<br /><br />For a club the size of ­Manchester United, the Europa League would be a great trophy to win. We’ve got the players and the quality to win it. It would save our season because the league has not been what we wanted and the Europa League gives us the opportunity to qualify for the Champions League gives us extra motivation. It’s always been my dream because I’ve never played in the Champions League and that’s something I’m very much looking forward to. That’s why it’s so important to win the Europa League if we don’t qualify for the top four</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Bailly believes 2017-18 can be a positive season for Manchester United as late goals will lead us to the Premier League title]</b> It shows promise because, compared with the team last year, it was more difficult then.<br /><br />Even though we had no bad performances, this year there’s something new that has improved, so we are happy about that. I hope that will continue because this year we can see a huge progression compared with last season.<br /><br />This year there is more desire, more success at everything we do. It’s important to see the team starting off well in top form, and I think that with the work we’ve done, and the work by the manager and the staff, we’ll continue the way we’ve begun and that will lead us to the Premier League title.<br /><br />I really feel very happy because you can see that we’re hard to beat at home, that we haven’t lost a match in fact. It gives us a lot of pleasure, gives us more confidence, and as I’ve said, it’s important for us, and also for the fans who come to support us. I hope that will continue because then we are more confident going into the away games, and that’s important for us too</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial is happy to be contributing at Manchester United despite struggling for starts]</b> I think we have a lot of very good players in the squad. When one does not play, the others do. The good thing about Anthony is that he is always here to help the team whenever he is needed and he showed that today. When Rashford plays, Anthony always has that mentality where he is ready to come on and have an impact - which he did by winning the match. Anthony, mentally, is strong. He is happy and whenever he has a chance he takes it<br /><br />I think it’s normal that there have been critics. You have to accept what they say and get back and train well and perform which we have done</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Bailly has seemingly ruled out any chance of leaving Manchester United this summer]</b> We would have liked to have finished the season by winning the FA Cup. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Nevertheless, we’ve wrapped up a season in which there were ups and downs. Now it’s time to stop, to learn from this season, to rest, and to enjoy our families and friends so we can come back next season even stronger. We’re eager to set new goals and to see lots of smiles in the stands at Old Trafford next year. Thanks for the support you have given the entire team throughout the season. And especially, thank you very much for the love you have always shown me. Let’s go United! And good luck to my teammates who are playing in the World Cup!</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Eric Bailly has hit out at Gary Neville]</b> I think the criticism was a bit harsh, particularly from people who have played the game and have probably made mistakes themselves during their career. As young players, we need support from these people. If we got more support from these people, that can help us. But negative comments all of the time doesn’t help the young players or the team. It was not just one individual performance on Sunday. It was the whole team that struggled. But it was just one battle lost, not the whole war. But it’s one game. We cannot forget that. We shouldn’t just focus on the negative, build on the positive and starting with Tottenham on Monday.<br /><br />I always take criticism well when it is constructive, when it is there to help and I actually like criticism but in a positive way. But what Graeme Souness said was a little bit disrespectful because it became so personal and it’s not the sort of criticism that can help a young player improve and become a better player</p>

  <p><b>[Bailly targeting silverware with <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> as he aims to repay faith shown in him]</b> Through all the tough times I’ve had, the club has always shown a lot of faith in me. And, as part of that show of confidence, they have given me this contract extension.<br /><br />So I need to be thankful for the confidence that they have shown in me, thankful and ready to give my best when I return to the team, to show them that I am completely behind the team, and, hopefully, to go on to lift some silverware in the future.<br /><br />There are still a lot of matches to be played. We’re still in all the different cups - <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, League Cup and the Europa League, as well as continuing to work in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We’re going to keep on it in training and stay united as a team, right through to the end of the season<br /><br />I’ve always remained motivated, equally at my best, as well as in my worst moments of injury. I had some difficult times last year but, once those times have passed, they are the past, and it’s time to make the most of these opportunities now presenting themselves. I’m fit and well, I’m back training with the team, building confidence for my return. This is going to be a very important year. Given those conditions <b>[at Tranmere]</b>, it wouldn’t have been the right pitch for a player returning from a long-term injury to start his returning match on such a surface. But I was happy to be with the team, to see them win the game, and that’s my focus, to prepare for the day when I’m back playing with them</p>

That’s what I’m working towards. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is a club that is used to being in the Champions League year after year, but the Europa League is a competition that not every team gets to be in, so it’s something we’re working hard in. Two or three seasons ago we were fortunate enough to go all the way and win it<br /><br />We’re in it again, this time with a younger squad that has lots and lots of talent, and I think there’s a real energy about the place that could help us to continue to progress through the tournament. This season we’re hoping for a repeat and that continue with the next challenge against Brugge</p>

  <p><b>[Bailly makes <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> future vow after extending contract through to 2022]</b> For me it was very important. At a time when I was suffering a little bit and struggling with my injury, the club showed great confidence, enough to extend my contract, and it gives me a real feeling of prestige to be able to continue being part of this squad and this club. The feeling then is that I want to pay back that faith and confidence they’ve shown in me and being part of something here<br /><br />The sensation I always get whenever I play for this team is to give my best and go as far as I possibly can for the team, and I think that feeling is accentuated when you come back from injury. You want to make up for every second that you’ve missed, so now I’m fully fit, I feel 100 per cent in myself, I’m really excited to be back part of things again and do what I do<br /><br />I think it’s always important to welcome new players such as <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> into the fold to keep progressing the team. Back in the summer we managed to get <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>, <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> and <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> in, who’ve really been a big part of things from the word go and they’ve really added to the squad. You always want to have quality signings coming in and I think the signings we’ve added during the January transfer window have been really positive as well. The quality they have added is great. We’ve seen in training so far that they’ve added to the squad. Odion is a very experienced player with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience from <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, so that’s adding good know-how to our attack. Bruno is a real talent, a pure talent. He was voted the best player in the Portuguese league in previous seasons and we’ve seen already the quality he’s brought. Even though he’s not used to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> we’ve already seen his quality and what he can do. They’ll just want to give their very best to the squad to help push us forward</p>

  <p><b>[‘Uncle’ <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> offers inspiration for Bailly in <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> trophy chase]</b> It’s important being able to work with someone who is a former player. Someone who understands the players’ situations, understands all the things that can happen from time to time. Because football is not just played on the pitch, it’s also about all the things that go on around the game, the things that people don’t see, and he is someone that gets that and it helps the team a lot. Besides being a coach, he’s just a normal person you know? I would say like an uncle<br /><br />Considering the position we are in now, I would prefer to win the Europa League because when you win that, it takes you to the Champions League. So for me, that’s my favourite. However, trying to win every game is important and that’s all we can do and see where that takes us<br /><br />When you’re injured you basically can’t do anything. The emotions you feel are just rage. But if it happens to you then, that’s that. You have to find some peace with it. It really was difficult seeing the team suffer at times and losing important matches but you know, it’s still such a young team and we still have so much to learn. But right before my return, the team was growing in confidence and I was lucky to return to the team that has a strong mentality</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s Eric Bailly eager to get back to his best after injury nightmare]</b> It was such a difficult time. I was basically injured for almost a year and that’s the worst thing that can happen to a footballer or any athlete.<br /><br />But anyway, as I always say, when something bad happens you have to hope for something good to come your way and during that time, when I was recuperating, I had people that helped me with the physical aspect and my family too. I had to be strong, especially mentally strong and I’ve done it and now all that bad stuff is behind me. Thank goodness for that.<br /><br />The most difficult part was the moment that you get that injury, and when I say injuries I mean that there are different levels of an injury. There are injuries that can keep you out for one week, others that keep you out for less and others that will keep you out for a lot more. And in my case, it was almost five months, and to hear that, honestly it was very difficult.<br /><br />Mentally, I had to be strong. I knew what I had to do to recover well and I listened to the advice from everyone that was helping me and here I am, and I’m doing well. If you’ve not been playing for a long time in a league as strong as this one, the truth is that it’s hard. Imagine with an injury as long as mine too. But the truth is, I’ve been lucky with my teammates to have their help and support and I had a phenomenal return<br /><br /><b>[He was thrust into action against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he said the 2-0 win gave him tremendous confidence]</b> It was a difficult match against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, my first match back, and thank God that we won and well, I’m very happy</p>

The truth is, he’s someone that will always talk to you. He always communicates well. He gives you so much confidence… because as a footballer, you go through moments where you feel low and he can read that and when he sees that he immediately comes over to you and talks to you. He offers advice so that you can regain confidence and for me that’s so important because, like I said, we have a very young team and if we have a coach like that then the team will go from strength to strength.</p>
