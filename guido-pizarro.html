  <p><b>[Outrage as Tigres score two goals against protesting Veracruz players who stood still for three minutes. While the Tigres players have been criticised for not standing in solidarity with the hosts, captain Guido Pizarro defended his team-mates]</b> They told us they were going to stop for a minute, after that they were going to stop for three. I told them we were only doing one minute. Several Veracruz players didn’t know it was going to be for three minutes. They found out from me. For them to make us responsible for a protest that they were making against their president I think is a mistake. We came here, respected what they did and went through with it</p>
