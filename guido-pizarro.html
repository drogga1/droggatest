  <p><b>[After Tigres took a strong advantage in the first leg, they finished off a 6-1 aggregate victory with a 2-0 win in the Estadio BBVA Bancomer]</b> I think we’re making a mistake if we think about the final because I think every team that’s in the Liguilla is a candidate to win it. So we took an important step for our fans and because we value every opponent we face. The matches that are going to come, I think, are going to be very tough.</p>

  <p><b>[Guido Pizarro is trying to focus on the here and now, but that might be hard for the Sevilla midfielder]</b> The reality is that what happened is what already came out. There was the chance to return to Tigres and with the departure of Berizzo, who was who had brought me here, it was a real possibility at one time. The truth is I’m really happy <b>[at Sevilla]</b>, very thankful to the club and as I’ve always said I have to give everything I have in me to support where I’m at now.<br /><br />Tigres is always going to be in my heart. God will say when I return, but meanwhile I want to enjoy and take advantage of where I am<br /><br />It isn’t detrimental to it. Liga MX has been growing a lot in the last few years and MLS also is growing. I feel that right now Liga MX is several steps above, but hopefully they keep growing. They have the economic power and infrastructure like other important federations. It will take some time, but they’ll end up being important leagues<br /><br /><b>[On Miguel Layun]</b> thought it was fantastic. He’s a player with a lot of experience who has come in from a big team like Porto. The reality is of the Mexicans playing, he’s the only one who plays in one of Europe’s biggest clubs. I’m wishing him the best of luck and hope he can stay here for many years. As a teammate and someone who knows what Mexico is as a country, he represents his country well, represents his culture well with the good person that he is and how he gets along with everyone. He does the country proud<br /><br /><b>[Pizarro would love to do the same for Argentina in Russia]</b> I try to avoid thinking about it. I try to live each day at Sevilla, play well and then, God will say if I return</p>

  <p><b>[Guido Pizarro’s Tigres return can inspire faith after Campeon de Campeones win]</b> We’ve got to keep going with the same humility we showed today. We approached the match with the highest level of concentration possible. We knew we were the ‘bigger team’, but without dedication that doesn’t mean anything. We’ve got to go into the tournament with that kind of humility.<br /><br />I’m happy to be here, to be able to come back and score a goal in front of the fans. For my family that’s in Monterrey and always supported me when I left, it’s a blessing to return</p>

  <p><b>[While an international title still eludes <a href="andre-pierre-gignac.html">Andre-Pierre Gignac</a>, he’s helped win the league on three occasions]</b> I’m proud of him - more than anything as a person. Hopefully on Sunday he can pass him.</p>

  <p><b>[Outrage as Tigres score two goals against protesting Veracruz players who stood still for three minutes. While the Tigres players have been criticised for not standing in solidarity with the hosts, captain Guido Pizarro defended his team-mates]</b> They told us they were going to stop for a minute, after that they were going to stop for three. I told them we were only doing one minute. Several Veracruz players didn’t know it was going to be for three minutes. They found out from me. For them to make us responsible for a protest that they were making against their president I think is a mistake. We came here, respected what they did and went through with it</p>
