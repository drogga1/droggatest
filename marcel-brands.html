  <p><b>[Everton’s director of football admitted the club were targeting younger players]</b> The players we brought in last year were all under 25 so we don’t want to invest big money in players who are older. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a club that also has to sell players so it is necessary to get younger players to invest in. That’s why we invested in young players last summer. <b>[Lucas]</b> <a href="lucas-digne.html">Digne</a> was 24, <b>[Yerry]</b> Mina 23, <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a> 21; so we look to players in the age group 20-25/26</p>

  <p><b>[Marcel Brands already sought to distance the Toffees from links to Hirving Lozano]</b> That <b>[players being linked]</b> always happens during this period. I read about David Neres, I read about Lozano. You name them, but we have no contact with these players.<br /><br />The fact that you can spend money means that you have to be much more careful. If you make a mistake here, you will hardly be able to get rid of them. Players earn a lot of money and there are not many clubs that can handle such salaries or transfer fees</p>

  <p><b>[Director of Football Marcel Brands was clearly pleased to see <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a> underline his loyalty to the club during a testing period]</b> We know in sport you always have to perform. That’s for me, that’s for the manager, that’s for the players, that’s for everyone. It’s also important, especially in this club after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation</p>

  <p><b>[Everton’s director of football Marcel Brands issues a statement welcoming <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> to the club]</b> Following a rigorous process conducted by all of our Directors, it is a pleasure to now welcome <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He is one of the finest managers in world football and a proven winner, having achieved a remarkable level of success in each of Europe’s major leagues<br /><br />He is the perfect appointment for us. He embraces our vision for the Club and we are sure that his enthusiasm to take the helm at Goodison together with his tactical abilities and well-renowned man-management will make him successful in this role. This was a clear and exciting decision for the Board to make. It was a unanimous choice and one we were all fully united behind throughout. Carlo has proven time and again, he knows how to build a trophy-winning side and we share the excitement of our fans at the prospect of him leading our team in the years ahead. We’re all greatly looking forward to working with him</p>
