  <p><b>[Everton have announced that Marcel Brands has been hired as the club’s new director of football]</b> It is a privilege to be joining Everton as director of football and I am incredibly excited to take on this challenge. It is only a challenge such as this which could have persuaded me to leave PSV where I am indebted to the many people whose collective effort led to some great achievements. Now we will look to build something really strong and lasting here at Everton</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Silva is set to be appointed Everton manager]</b> I think it is important that he wants to work in the new philosophy, the new strategy of how we want to work with a director of football. I think it is important that he creates the environment for the long-term, and I think it is important that he is a modern coach. If you think about what Everton’s plans are, I think a modern coach will fit into that profile.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcel Brands has denied reports that inflated agent fees]</b> No, no, it was really simple behind the scenes. I put the offer in and Barcelona asked for a totally different amount that we would never have paid. Then they said: ‘Ok, we will wait until the end of the market.’ We never changed our offer. That was a bit of a gamble because everyone was writing about Man United <b>[potentially tabling an offer]</b> and Barcelona used that, agents used that, everyone used it. I don’t know exactly if Man United were in. The player said constantly to me: ‘I want to go to Everton’. That was a great thing for us but you never know if Man United comes in and offers an extra £150,000 a week - every player would like to do that. I don’t know exactly the situation with Man United, but of course Barcelona used it. They said to me: ‘Man United are coming in.’ I don’t know if they did but I took a bit of a risk with that. That’s why we were also keen on back-ups, you never know, but after the weekend before the market closed I had a confident feeling about it.</p>

  <p><b>[No Everton contact for Hirving Lozano and David Neres]</b> That <b>[players being linked]</b> always happens during this period. I read about Neres, I read about Lozano. You name them, but we have no contact with these players<br /><br />The fact that you can spend money means that you have to be much more careful. If you make a mistake here, you will hardly be able to get rid of them. Players earn a lot of money and there are not many clubs that can handle such salaries or transfer fees.</p>

It’s also important, especially in this club after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation</p>

He is one of the finest managers in world football and a proven winner, having achieved a remarkable level of success in each of Europe’s major leagues<br /><br />He is the perfect appointment for us. He embraces our vision for the Club and we are sure that his enthusiasm to take the helm at Goodison together with his tactical abilities and well-renowned man-management will make him successful in this role. This was a clear and exciting decision for the Board to make. It was a unanimous choice and one we were all fully united behind throughout. Carlo has proven time and again, he knows how to build a trophy-winning side and we share the excitement of our fans at the prospect of him leading our team in the years ahead. We’re all greatly looking forward to working with him</p>
