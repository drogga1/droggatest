<blockquote>
  <p>[FA announced it had charged Manchester City with a violation of its anti-doping regulations] The failure of Manchester City to update their information may seem like a simple administrative mistake, but the FA are likely to take this matter seriously. While there has been no suggestion that Manchester City or any of the players have tried to conceal the taking of illicit substances, the whereabout programme underpins the FA’s anti-doping efforts. Any breach of these regulations, regardless of how minor it may appear, undermines the effectiveness of the regime, and the FA have acted swiftly to counter this.<br /><br />The FA has wide-ranging powers when it comes to punishment, from a reprimand or fine all the way up to a points deduction or even expulsion from the organisation itself. Given that this is the first time that Manchester City have been charged with this type of offence, as well as the administrative nature of the misconduct, a fine appears the most likely punishment.</p>
