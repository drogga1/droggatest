  <p><b>[Paul Elliott believes that David Luiz is entering his prime as a defender]</b> Bringing in David Luiz, people thought, ‘you know what, there’s a lot of mistakes in him. But he has been consistent. Not only has he been consistent, he has matured. He is 29-years-old now and that, being a former centre half, is the perfect age for now and the next three years, you are going to see a great consistency for Luiz. He knows now and he is making the right decisions. He isn’t taking unnecessary risks, he knows when he should kick it into row Z or when to get it down and play. His concentration has become excellent<br /><br />Of course <b>[he should get a new contract]</b>. His impact on the club. Impact on the dressing room. Impact on the dugout. He’s the manager’s confidant. He is a great ambassador for the club, I don’t have to sell it to get him a contract, his characteristics speak for themselves. JT is a team player. Of course, he wants to play but the thing with JT is that part of being a leader is accepting the team comes first and the players come first. The club comes first and that part his acceptance and of his great characteristics of being a leader that what’s happening and nobody more than him wants the team to keep winning. Of course, he wants to play. The professional inside him wants to play but he is mature enough and sensible enough to do the right thing for Chelsea and that will continue<br /><br />I think it is important because they represent different generations and that diversity of players is representative in the fan base and I think that’s a wonderful thought. Chelsea are doing the right thing, they are a proper football club off the pitch. Bruce Buck is an outstanding man and a great man. Obviously, <b>[Roman]</b> Abramovich, it has been a wonderful success story for him. He has supported the club in a way that very few have. It has been great and they deserve to win the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[The eight-match suspension handed to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> goalkeeper Kiko Casilla for using racist language shows that kind of behaviour will not be tolerated]</b> I’m not <b>[privy]</b> to the details of the case but if you look at the sanction, any sanction sends a strong message. Here at <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> what is important is that we have a message of zero tolerance generically across everything. Zero tolerance is important and consistent application of that is important. But education and rehabilitation is also important because people can say the wrong things, everyone can be guilty of saying wrong things. The message is clear across the game but what we are also saying is that there is an opportunity to reintegrate and rehabilitate yourself back into football. The sanction sends a strong message but also the training, education and rehabilitation to create a pathway back into football</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Paul Elliott has empathised with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> after seeing him go into the crowd to confront a fan who had been arguing with his brother]</b> All I can say is, I have played in three different countries and I have experienced racism. I have had an <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> moment in my head every time I have played. I have seen banana throwing, monkey chanting, booing and your family getting abused. With <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a>, I can understand the human context of that because he wanted to protect his family. I felt exactly the same way when my family was watching me in Italy, watching me in Scotland and the ugly days in the UK. We all feel the same way. We want our families to enjoy the day and watch us play with great pride and joy.<br /><br />So, I am wholly empathetic with Eric. I don’t know him and I have never met him but I am empathetic with him. <b>[What you get paid]</b> has got nothing to do with it. When you go on that pitch, you don’t sign up to get abused. You sign up to compete and you sign up in the laws of the association to play football. We have to talk about zero tolerance with supporter behaviour as well. There may be a fine line but it is important people play within the rules.<br /><br /><b>[He believes football clubs are battling against a general political atmosphere that sees racism on the increase]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are magnificent. I support <a href="bruce-buck.html">Bruce Buck</a> on his work that he does with Antisemitism. It shows best practice. No question about it. It is the best such campaign in London football<br /><br />You and I know we are in a challenging time. I have always said when you have racism in society, then you are going to have it in football. But football is doing some really good work, in my view, the clubs and players don’t get enough recognition for the work they do.<br /><br />Everybody wants to look at the one negative but behind that negative, there’s 100s of great causes that the clubs support. Corporate social responsibility underpins every club. It isn’t the sexiest thing that gets the acclaim and you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t.<br /><br />That’s why these events are important because you put that alongside the star-studded stuff like <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> winning the best London Footballer. In these hardened challenging times, it is the power of football to deliver messages on anti-discrimination, equality, diversity and inclusion</p>

I am delighted for their manner and approach and example they are setting by giving young English talent a chance to flourish and now they see the rewards.

  <p><b>[Paul Elliott says extreme adversity has created a ‘window of opportunity’ for football to increase diversity at all levels]</b> We’ve had a fantastic response from senior leaders across the game, including owners, chairs, players and coaches. Today’s meeting was a great kick-off to the three-month programme and, with October marking Black History Month, it feels like the right time to launch the code. While it’s still early in development, it’s clear that everybody is pulling in the same direction and there is a strong will from the group to create positive action and make meaningful change. Together with leaders from across the industry we are hoping to drive the nation’s response to inequality by ensuring the leadership of our national sport reflects the communities that watch and love the game</p>
