  <p><b>[Roma director Frederic Massara said defender Antonio Rudiger suffered from it in his side’s 3-1 loss to Lazio]</b> He was very angry with the racist chanting we had to put up with. It’s a shame you still hear these things.</p>

  <p><b>[Frederic Massara says <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> is still evaluating his future and is not in negotiations with Milan over a January transfer]</b> There is no news on Ibrahimovic, because this is not a negotiation. He is evaluating his future. He is on the market, but there are no developments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ibrahimovic future to be decided at the end of the season]</b> Ibrahimovic is a champion. The team <b>[has]</b> improved a great deal with his arrival but, come the end of the season, we need to sit down and discuss the situation, including his own state of mind. He wanted to help Milan during a difficult time for the club. It goes without saying that any team is improved by having Ibrahimovic in it as he is a phenomenal player<br /><br />Milan cannot stay outside Europe for long, so qualification is absolutely a primary objective for us. Our united idea is to get Milan back to the top of Italian and European football. There are some parameters we need to stay within, but we don’t want to give up on being competitive</p>
