  <p><b>[George Burley says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> failed with a bid of ‘three or four million’ for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> when the Welshman was making waves at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b> He was like a winger playing at full-back. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were interested in him. I remember going to a hotel and speaking to Sir Alex and his chief executive. We’d already sold <a href="theo-walcott.html">Theo Walcott</a> for £12 million and they offered three or four million so we said ‘no way’. I think they were a little bit worried about his defensive side of the game, which we were working at, but he could handle that.<br /><br />I was always a manager who looked towards young players and the academy. <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> had a multitude of good, young promising players. <a href="theo-walcott.html">Theo Walcott</a> was the young player people were always speaking about when I initially took over as manager, and Gareth was another player that showed a lot of promise. Gareth from day one showed tremendous ability. He was a young player I enjoyed working with. There’s no doubt there were a number of young players there and Gareth was probably the pick of the bunch. I had every confidence in Gareth. I was a full-back myself, an attacking full-back and so for me I really enjoyed him</p>
