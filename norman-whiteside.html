  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Norman Whiteside was grateful that he finished his education in Belfast and not Manchester, as the club had asked him to do]</b> Now that I’ve seen what an English education did for <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>, I’m sure I made the right decision</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United were unattractive and had lost their fear factor under Jose Mourinho]</b> People were leaving the ground early, they were so hard to watch. I’d never seen that at Old Trafford before. Even in the hospitality suites, where they pay top dollar, they’d just brush out past you. The results weren’t good, the football was unattractive, visiting teams no longer feared coming to Old Trafford. It couldn’t go on.<br /><br /><b>[On on Solskjaer’s impact]</b> It’s the United style of play we know and love. It’s not just Ole’s results that have lifted the mood - it is the way he is getting them. United are a team going forward again with the crowd behind them. Players who looked inhibited and afraid under Jose have now thrown off whatever shackles were holding them back and are expressing themselves freely. Ole hasn’t exactly waved a magic wand. He’s simply reminded the players of their quality … that’s why you are in the team, go out and show it.<br /><br />I can’t pinpoint a single reason why it all went wrong under Jose. Just as good players don’t become bad players overnight, neither do managers. He won three trophies in his first season, including the Europa League, a hard one to achieve, and a year and a half later, it all turns to dust and he is gone. It is hard to fathom.<br /><br />What I would say is that even when he was successful and winning trophies, for United and elsewhere, his style of play and methods were never the United way. Communication, I feel, was a big problem. A gulf seemed to develop between him and his players, Paul Pogba in particular. A lot of fans won’t have been enamoured by Pogba and his social media persona but the problems between player and manager can’t have been all one way.<br /><br />Something wasn’t right in the dressing room, whispers were starting to find their way into the media, it obviously wasn’t a happy camp and that translated into performances on the pitch. The whole player-manager relationship seemed to break down under Jose. Look at the way he habitually bawled out young players like Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford. That was bound to affect their confidence.<br /><br />I saw players reluctant to express themselves for fear of a rollicking from the touchline. In the end, there was a chasm between him and the players. Anyone who understands United knew he had to go. To be honest, he wasn’t my choice for the job in the first place. I would like to have seen Pep Guardiola given the job but that isn’t going to happen now</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have already decided to change manager at the end of the season]</b> I’m pleased with United’s form. They are on a good run but I still think that the club have their minds made up to change manager at the end of the season. Unless of course Ole goes and wins the next 10 games and then United may be backed into a corner. If Ole keeps winning I could eat my words because they may have to give the job to him.<br /><br />Pochettino has been mentioned a lot but he won’t be the only one the closer we get to the end of the season. I expect Zidane will be in there and there will be others interested as well. Some of the big guns around Europe may get the sack or leave their clubs and it will be about who is up for grabs at the end of the season.<br /><br />United will then sit down and work out what Ole has done and see what big managers are available. I’m sure that the people upstairs will have their own names in mind and it will be interesting to see who they choose.<br /><br />People are starting to run forward and pass forward and get into the box and do things that they weren’t doing. The reins have been taken off Marcus Rashford and he is scoring goals for fun and creating goals. Paul Pogba is now getting in the box and making things happen and they have become like two brand new players. I’m only using them as an example because other players have also turned their form around overnight. You can make of that what you want</p>
