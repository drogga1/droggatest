  <p><b>[What the coronavirus crisis is like for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> loanees abroad]</b> The prime minister said we could only go out to the supermarket or pharmacy and that if we didn’t have to go out, just don’t go out. I’m training at home, doing exercises, doing some bike and core work. I’m doing as much as I can, but it’s just not the same as being outside on the pitch when you are training with the manager and the boys and preparing for games. It is tough. Usually we train the whole week and get prepared for when the game comes, but now we have a different match and we have to stay home. It’s a mental test now, a mental challenge and we have to look for positives. If we look at the negatives all the time, it’s not going to be a good thing for us, so I’m trying to stay positive. The situation is how it is for now so we have to get used to it</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Iliev was in the middle of one of the three trials he had at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as a 17-year-old when he noticed <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> making his way over to where he was training]</b> I was nervous because I knew I had to do well if I wanted to sign, but at the same time it was a great motivation for me to be surrounded by people like that. I was thinking if I’m here, I must be worth it<br /><br />It has gone quickly. When you are at a club like this people take care of you and make you feel really happy. I’ve learnt a lot at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I went there as a boy and now I’m a grown man, not just in football but in life. I’ve learnt how to lead my life, how to respect and talk to other people. I’m really happy to be at a big club like Arsenal<br /><br />After I came back <b>[from the injury]</b> in 2017 I had to train for one year to get back to my fitness. In 2018 I was No.3 goalkeeper when me, Petr <b>[<a href="petr-cech.html">Cech</a>]</b> and Bernd <b>[Leno]</b> all went to the Europa League final. Then I asked if I could go out on loan to get some experience. I’m now here in Poland and hopefully in the future I will get a chance to show my quality at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I really hope that this will happen and I’m working hard to get this chance. I’m not going to give up, I still believe that I can make it<br /><br />It was a very difficult time and I didn’t know where I was going. I was stuck in a place where at some points I thought my career would be over because of the injury. Even the doctors couldn’t believe what was happening. Mentally it was tough. As the time was going by and with the uncertainty of what was happening, it was getting more and more difficult<br /><br />I worked with the psychologist at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and that really helped me to try to stay positive as much as possible. I was talking to them open and honestly. I got to the point when I said this is going to be a career-ending one for me because it seemed like there was no way out. But then I started to believe again. I had my last operation, I said it was my last operation and that I would give it a go. After that my knee was feeling good and it all worked out. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were so supportive. The psychologists, doctors, the whole club were behind me and they believed in me. When I look back, it’s not a nice pleasure, but it definitely made me stronger and nowadays I play football without any problem<br /><br />When we are all good, we think we don’t need help. But when we are bad, or have a bad game or a bad day, sometimes you have negative thoughts and this is very important to control. If you make a mistake in a game after just 20 minutes and you have to play the rest of the 70 minutes still thinking about the mistake you have made, you destroy yourself and you won’t show the quality you have. So I believe psychologists play a big part and a big role in football, they help you train yourself, train your brain and actually be prepared that if something goes wrong, you can bounce back and perform at the highest level<br /><br /><a href="bernd-leno.html">Bernd Leno</a> is a top keeper, one of the best in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s actually a very good friend of mine. We talk regularly and message each other. He’s not just a good goalkeeper, he’s a great person as well. I’ve learnt a lot from him and from <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>. Working with them was a great experience for me. He was my idol growing up. When I was little I was watching him and trying to pretend to be him. He was a great role model for me so it was a pleasure to work with him at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It was amazing to be a part of his career</p>
