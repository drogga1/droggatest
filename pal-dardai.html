  <p><b>[Leckie thrilled to join ‘fantastic club’ Hertha Berlin]</b> Mathew Leckie is a versatile player and has shown that he has the pace to bomb up and down the flanks, and that’ll benefit us a lot when it comes to attacking</p>

  <p><b>[Hertha coach Pal Dardai confirmed he would be taking a closer look at Jonathan Klinsmann in pre-season]</b> Yes, that’s true, we want to get to know him, especially our goalkeeper coach Zsolt Petry. This is why he is to be tested with us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jonathan Klinsmann received a big opportunity with the club out of contention in the Europa League as he was handed the start against Ostersunds FK. Klinsmann did not disappoint, making three stops, including a penalty, in a 1-1 draw]</b> Klinsmann had a very good game, he stayed firm under pressure and saved the penalty. But it wasn’t just him who played well. Jonathan is a young man and he had a good game. But he needs to keep working hard, continue to learn and build on this showing. Today he gets an ‘A’.</p>
