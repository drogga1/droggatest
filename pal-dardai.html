  <p><b>[Leckie thrilled to join ‘fantastic club’ <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>]</b> Mathew Leckie is a versatile player and has shown that he has the pace to bomb up and down the flanks, and that’ll benefit us a lot when it comes to attacking</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> coach Pal Dardai confirmed he would be taking a closer look at Jonathan <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> in pre-season]</b> Yes, that’s true, we want to get to know him, especially our goalkeeper coach Zsolt Petry. This is why he is to be tested with us.</p>

  <p><b>[Hertha Berlin vs Liverpool]</b> For us, it is the first pre-season game that we will tackle a bit more to our system and play with a large number of candidates for the first-team. In Aston Villa and Malaga <b>[2-1 win]</b>, we had good international opponents. These games are good for the learning process. It will be the same against Liverpool - it will be a great game for the spectators too.</p>

  <p><b>[Pal Dardai has been blown away by Marko Grujic’s all-round talent]</b> I’ve been at Hertha for 22 years. This isn’t meant as an insult to anyone else, but Marko is by far the best midfielder I’ve seen in my time at the club. I was a defensive midfielder and managed to score 17 goals, which isn’t bad. But Marko carries much more of a goal threat, he’s got a sensational shot on him and is much better than I was. He can play anywhere in midfield. He’s got so much potential, and you can see that out on the pitch. He’s so robust in the middle of the park, but he can still play. He’s good in the air, he wins tackles and has got such a strong desire to win. I can only say: ‘respect’</p>
